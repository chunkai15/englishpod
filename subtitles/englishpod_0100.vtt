00:00.000 --> 00:08.640
Hello English learners. Welcome back to another lesson here with us at English Pod. My name is Marko.

00:08.640 --> 00:15.040
And I'm Erica. And today we are going to have a very casual normal conversation.

00:15.040 --> 00:21.440
That's right. We're going to listen in on some small talk between a taxi driver and the passenger.

00:21.440 --> 00:28.640
Small talk. So that's basically small short conversations you have with someone that you don't know very well.

00:28.640 --> 00:32.000
Okay. So typical questions like how old are you where you're from?

00:32.000 --> 00:37.440
Yeah, et cetera. That's right. And this could be really hard for English learners because they often don't know what they're

00:37.440 --> 00:44.320
right thing to say or the right thing to talk about. So we're going to give you a lot of phrases in this lesson that you can use in small talk.

00:44.320 --> 00:51.280
Okay. So we don't have anything to preview today. So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time. And then we'll come back.

00:52.080 --> 01:05.120
Where to, Miss? Hi, Frencho and Hawthorne at the holiday aim that is on that corner.

01:05.120 --> 01:12.640
Sure thing. So where are you flying in from? From China. Really? You don't look very

01:12.640 --> 01:18.880
Chinese to me if you don't mind me saying so. It's fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China

01:18.880 --> 01:24.480
on a business trip visiting some local companies that manufacture battle products. Wow, sounds interesting.

01:25.280 --> 01:32.000
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy but how old are you? Don't you know it's rude to ask the lady her age?

01:32.560 --> 01:37.280
Don't get me wrong. It's just that you seem so young and are you doing business overseas?

01:37.280 --> 01:42.240
Well, thank you. In that case, I am 26 years old and what about yourself?

01:43.200 --> 01:50.080
I'm 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old USA. Although I have some Colombian heritage.

01:50.080 --> 01:55.200
Really, that's great. Do you speak Spanish? Yeah, of course.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.200
Give you an interest. We can talk in Spanish.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.560
Alright, so I don't think this guy spoke much Spanish, do you?

02:08.560 --> 02:12.400
No, even though he has Colombian heritage, I think he doesn't speak much.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.400
But maybe he's just a little bit rusty. Maybe, but what he does speak is English.

02:16.400 --> 02:22.320
And since this is English pod, why don't we look at some of the phrases that they used for small talk and fluency builder?

02:23.520 --> 02:24.560
Fluency builder.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.080
Alright, so today I'm fluency builder. We're going to take a look at phrases that both the passenger

02:30.080 --> 02:34.880
and the taxi driver use to make small talk. So why don't we start with the first one?

02:34.880 --> 02:39.520
Alright, so the taxi driver tells the passenger that she doesn't look very Chinese.

02:39.520 --> 02:50.640
If you don't mind me saying so. Right, so he said, you don't look very Chinese to me if you don't mind me saying so.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.200
So what does he mean by this the last part of his sentence?

02:53.200 --> 03:00.080
Well, this is a phrase that we use to soften a sort of a statement that might be a little bit rude.

03:00.080 --> 03:07.440
She could be Chinese, right? So it may be a little bit rude to say that, but he kind of apologizes.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.320
That's right. Right, by saying if you don't mind me saying so.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.120
Okay, so for example, I could say, hey Marco, you look a little tired today if you don't mind me saying so.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.120
Okay, so does it always go at the end?

03:17.200 --> 03:21.680
You could use it at the beginning. If you don't mind me saying so, I just don't think this is a good idea.

03:21.680 --> 03:26.480
Okay, very good. So you can use this phrase in the beginning or at the end of a sentence.

03:26.480 --> 03:32.720
Right, and it makes your statement a little bit less rude if you don't mind me saying so.

03:32.720 --> 03:40.000
Now again, he also apologizes a little bit when he says, excuse me if I am being a bit nosy,

03:40.000 --> 03:46.960
but, excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but, excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.320
Okay, so let's take a look at this nosy. What's this?

03:50.320 --> 03:55.680
Okay, when somebody is nosy, it means they're very curious. They are asking too many questions.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.240
Yeah, asking more questions than they should ask.

03:58.240 --> 04:03.200
Right. So he apologizes and says, well, excuse me if I'm asking too many questions,

04:03.200 --> 04:06.640
and then he asks her another question.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.400
Yes, they're how old she is.

04:08.400 --> 04:14.400
Right. So again, it's a polite way of maybe asking a question that might be a little bit sensitive.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.160
Yeah, or a little bit in polite.

04:16.160 --> 04:21.040
Okay, so of course, asking a woman her age, maybe is a little bit in polite, right?

04:21.040 --> 04:27.840
Yes, typically women don't like that too much, but our next phrase, we heard the taxi driver say,

04:27.840 --> 04:29.760
don't get me wrong.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.040
Don't get me wrong.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.240
Don't get me wrong.

04:32.240 --> 04:36.320
Okay, so don't get me wrong. He says, well, don't misunderstand what I'm saying.

04:36.400 --> 04:41.600
That's right. This phrase is used so commonly in English that I think it would help us to hear some examples.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.920
Example one.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.040
Don't get me wrong. It's not that I think you stole my computer.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.160
It's just that you, with the only one who could get into my room.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.400
Example two.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.960
I do have a few problems with the pan, but don't get me wrong. I still think it's a good idea.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.280
Example three.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.840
I don't get me wrong.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.880
I think John's a nice guy. He's just a bit disorganized.

05:10.160 --> 05:13.360
All right, very good example. So don't get me wrong, right?

05:13.360 --> 05:17.200
That's right. And now for the final phrase on putting it together today.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.720
Well, the passenger, the woman, um, says her age.

05:20.720 --> 05:25.040
And she says, I'm 26 years old and what about yourself?

05:25.040 --> 05:26.320
What about yourself?

05:26.320 --> 05:27.600
What about yourself?

05:27.600 --> 05:31.440
All right. Now, this sentence isn't very correct, actually, right?

05:31.520 --> 05:37.920
Yeah, technically it's not correct in grammar, but it is you so commonly every day by

05:37.920 --> 05:40.800
American English speakers that we thought we'd show it to you.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.960
Okay. So you would say I am 26 years old and what about you?

05:44.960 --> 05:49.280
That's right. Okay. But common that you will hear people say, what about yourself?

05:49.280 --> 05:53.680
And if you use this, um, you'll sound really fluent and really native like.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.720
Okay, very good. So what about yourself?

05:56.800 --> 06:01.120
So again, it's, it's just like, what about you? So I could say, um, hey,

06:01.120 --> 06:04.560
Mark, I'm going away on holiday this weekend and what about yourself?

06:04.560 --> 06:10.320
Okay. What about yourself? So we've taken a look at these four phrases on putting it together.

06:10.320 --> 06:14.720
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the second time? We're going to slow it down a little bit.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.400
And then we'll come back and take a look at some vocabulary words on language takeaway.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.080
Where to miss? Hi.

06:30.080 --> 06:35.760
Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the holiday in that is on that corner.

06:35.760 --> 06:41.680
Sure thing. So where are you flying in from?

06:41.680 --> 06:49.440
From China. Really? You don't look very Chinese to me if you don't mind me saying so.

06:49.600 --> 06:59.120
It's fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip visiting some local

06:59.120 --> 07:06.160
companies that manufacture bathroom products. Wow, sounds interesting.

07:07.200 --> 07:16.000
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you? Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady

07:16.400 --> 07:26.160
her age? Don't get me wrong. It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

07:26.160 --> 07:33.760
Well, thank you. In that case, I am 26 years old and what about yourself?

07:33.760 --> 07:40.800
I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.S. Ave.

07:40.800 --> 07:49.120
Although I have some Colombian heritage. Really? That's great. Do you speak some Spanish?

07:49.120 --> 07:52.960
Uh, yeah. Of course.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.720
Gave in. In Tonses Podemos hablar en español.

08:03.360 --> 08:09.600
Well, we've got some interesting vocabulary words and phrases here in language takeaway and the first one.

08:09.680 --> 08:14.960
Well, after she gets in the taxi and tells him where she wants to go, he answers by saying,

08:14.960 --> 08:21.280
Sure thing. Sure thing. Sure thing. Sure thing. So if I say, yeah, sure thing. What does that mean?

08:21.280 --> 08:23.680
Well, let's listen to some examples to help us understand.

08:25.200 --> 08:32.080
Example one. Do you mind ending me 100 bucks? Sure thing. Example two.

08:32.400 --> 08:37.440
Could you please send me the email by the end of the day? Sure thing.

08:38.720 --> 08:43.840
Example three. Do you mind letting me a hundred bucks? Sure thing.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.480
Could you please send me the email by the end of the day? Sure thing.

08:47.680 --> 08:53.040
Example four. Can you get some milk on the way home? Sure thing. I want more in now.

08:54.160 --> 09:00.400
Okay, so sure thing. Basically, yeah, no problem or okay. Or I'll do it. I'll do it. It's fine.

09:00.400 --> 09:06.000
Yeah. So it's a very common way you will hear this a lot when somebody agrees or says,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.800
Yes, no problem. Yeah, and again, it will help you sound really native like to use this phrase.

09:10.800 --> 09:16.560
Well, the next one, the taxi driver says, I was born and raised here.

09:17.120 --> 09:24.960
I was born and raised here. Born and raised. Okay, so this is a way of saying I was born in this

09:25.040 --> 09:29.840
country and I haven't left this country. That's right. So I'm from this country.

09:29.840 --> 09:38.400
Okay. Born and raised here in the good old US of A. Good old US of A. The good old US of A.

09:38.400 --> 09:44.080
So this is a pretty interesting way of saying America. Right. It's actually more of a phrase.

09:44.080 --> 09:50.320
Right. The good old US of A. Yeah. Okay. So it means the good United States of America.

09:50.400 --> 09:57.040
It's kind of a fond way or friendly way of describing America. All right. And we have one more word for

09:57.040 --> 10:02.560
language takeaway. Well, the taxi driver was talking about his Colombian heritage.

10:02.560 --> 10:08.480
Colombian heritage. Heritage. All right. So if I have Colombian heritage, what does that mean?

10:08.480 --> 10:14.400
Your grandmother or, you know, grandfather, great grandmother or someone in your family is from

10:14.480 --> 10:20.480
Colombia. Okay. And what about the word heritage by itself? Yeah. So your heritage is basically your

10:20.480 --> 10:30.640
culture, your customs, your customs, your history. Okay. So heritage, a country rich in heritage.

10:30.640 --> 10:36.080
Lots of good old historical culture in that country. Okay. Very good. So now it's time for us to

10:36.080 --> 10:41.120
listen to the dialogue for the last time. Now we can understand all these phrases and these great

10:41.200 --> 10:44.880
words that we've just looked at and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

10:50.560 --> 10:56.480
Where to, Miss? Hi, Frencho and Hawthorne at the holiday in that is on that corner.

10:57.280 --> 11:05.120
Sure thing. So where you flying in from? From China. Really? You don't look very

11:05.120 --> 11:10.560
Chinese to me. If you don't mind me saying so. It's fine. I am actually from Mexico.

11:10.640 --> 11:15.840
I was in China on a business trip visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.

11:15.840 --> 11:20.320
Wow, sounds interesting. Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

11:21.680 --> 11:26.960
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady for age? Don't get me wrong. It's just that you

11:26.960 --> 11:33.440
seem so young and are already doing business overseas. Well, thank you. In that case, I am 26 years old

11:33.440 --> 11:38.640
and what about your self? I'm 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old

11:38.960 --> 11:45.120
USAA. Although I have some Colombian heritage. Really? That's great. Do you speak Spanish?

11:45.680 --> 11:49.760
Yeah, of course. Give you an interest. We can speak Spanish.

11:57.760 --> 12:03.440
So Marco, this taxi driver makes a bit of a mistake when he asks the woman how old she is. Yes,

12:04.080 --> 12:10.080
yeah, exactly. There are a couple of questions that in some cultures are considered to be normal

12:10.080 --> 12:15.040
and okay, but in other cultures they're not really well accepted. Okay, so an Anglo culture,

12:15.040 --> 12:20.560
for example, it's really impolite to ask a woman how old she is. Right, women are a little bit

12:20.560 --> 12:25.680
more sensitive about the rage. Others aren't so much, but it's usually better to just not ask.

12:25.680 --> 12:30.160
Yeah, and what else should we avoid talking about in small talk? Well, for example, when you

12:30.160 --> 12:35.920
ask a person their occupation, you can ask what they do for a living, but don't ask how much money

12:35.920 --> 12:40.800
they make. That's right, Anglo people are really sensitive about talking about money. We hate talking

12:40.800 --> 12:46.000
about money. Right, so don't ask somebody their salary or how much money they make. It's just

12:46.000 --> 12:52.080
not considered to be polite. And another good one to be careful of is asking if someone is married

12:52.080 --> 12:57.200
or not. Right, sometimes you're just being friendly and you want to know if that person has

12:57.680 --> 13:03.280
family or something, but you have to be careful when and where you ask this question. Right, so if they've

13:03.280 --> 13:08.400
mentioned their family or if they talked about their kids or something else to do with their family,

13:08.400 --> 13:13.920
then it's okay. Right, you can say, well, how long have you been married? Yeah, but if a guy asks a girl

13:13.920 --> 13:19.360
or you married, it kind of sounds like maybe he's interested in her or that he's trying to

13:19.360 --> 13:25.520
to come on to her and to be maybe more than friendly, right? That's right. Okay, so some great
