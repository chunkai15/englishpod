00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson here at English Pod, my name is Marko.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
My name is Catherine, hello everyone.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
And today we've got a great lesson for you at the upper intermediate level.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
We're going to be talking about an interesting topic which is gambling.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Yeah, I don't know if you like to do this, Marko, go, you know.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm actually going to play some cards, play some poker, blackjack, throw the dice.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I'm actually a bit of a fan of the roulette.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Throw the ball into the wheel that's spinning and lands into like a little compartment in a number.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Right, so you can win like based on the number and the color.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
But it's interesting because if you get the number right, it pays you 35 times your bet.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Wow, that's a lot of money to win.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
A lot of potential there, but there's a lot of numbers on that wheel.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
But that's the thing, some people like gambling, some people don't like it.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
And in some countries, in some states, it's illegal, right?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Exactly.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
So today we're talking about a city that's looking to legalize this sport.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
So we're going to take a listen here at one time.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
We come back.

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
We're talking all about what's going on today's lesson.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Did you hear the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city?

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Soon you're going to have amazing hotels and casinos here, which will be good for business.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Are you serious?

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
It disgusts me.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
What are you talking about?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
How does it exploit people?

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Well, to begin with, gambling is addictive.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
It ruins marriages, destroys families, and bankrupt communities.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Once you're addicted, it's very difficult to stop.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
People have lost their houses, cars, and have been left out on the street after becoming addicted.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for social interaction.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Geez.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Although I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn't become addicted or anything like that.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
You cannot predict who will be committed to gambling.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Now, excuse me.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I have a protest value to organize.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
All right, so a very strong opinion against gambling, right?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Absolutely, so we've got someone who hasn't really thought it through.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
And another person who has thought way too much about what's going on.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Right?

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
And well, he did point out some very interesting arguments against gambling.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
And so we're going to take a look at some of the language that person used today in language takeaway.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Language takeaway.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Well, this first thing we've got here is a word that has to do with the topic of today's lesson.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
So legalizing gambling.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
What does it mean to legalize?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Right.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
So to legalize, to make it legal.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
So legal is the word that refers to law.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
And so that means to make something okay.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
It means to allow something in a state or country.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Exactly.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
So in many countries, it's illegal to gamble.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
So in this case, this city is looking to legalize it to make it legal.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
All right.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
So many young people in America would like to see this law changed.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
You're not allowed to drink until you're 21 years old.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Drink alcohol that is.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
So they would like to see the legalization of underage drinking.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Now, is it 21 in all states or in the majority of all states?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I thought it was only in some of them.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Now, it changed in the late 70s, I think.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
But you absolutely cannot drink until you're 21.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Wow.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
What do you think?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Is that okay?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Or is that?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
I think that it encourages young people to drink irresponsibly.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
And so I believe we should legalize drinking at the age of 18.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Because it would make people learn how to be more responsible.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Right.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Interesting.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
All right.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
So we want to legalize underage drinking.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
English fun.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
All right.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, let's not many people in my words, but this next word is very, very important.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
He's saying that gambling or the gambling industry exploits people.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Okay.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Exploite.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
You might have heard this in the news before.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
We talked about often in the news, the exploitation of people.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
But in this case, we're talking about, yeah, exploiting people through money and gambling.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Right.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
To exploit basically is to take advantage of them.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, to use them for something, not to treat them as people, but to use them as a way to get something.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
All right.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
So we often hear about it as you're saying news about factories or companies exploiting their employees

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
or something of the sort.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
We can also exploit the earth for its resources by taking oil and taking diamonds and taking gold.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Okay.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So to take advantage of interesting.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
So to exploit is the verb, but exploitation is the now.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
All right.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
That's the thing.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
So we talk about the exploitation of people in this country or the exploitation of the earth.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Mm-hmm.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
And they're talking about how gambling exploits people and how it's a vice.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Ooh, vice is.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
So for those of you, a Christians out there, you might be very familiar with the sins.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Right.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
The seven deadly sins.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Well, these are all vices.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Things that you do that are bad.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Mm-hmm.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
So drinking too much is a vice.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Right.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Or eating too much, right?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
All right.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Or spending money without having money may be a vice for you.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
So addictions are also a type of vice, right?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Like drinking, smoking, or drug abuse.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Exactly.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
These are all vices.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
So vice is a bad thing.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Now we often, now we may remember this show.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Popular American show called Miami Vice.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
So what is that?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Ooh.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Well, Miami Vice.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
It's in the city of Miami.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I mean, it's about police officers.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
They're sometimes a group called the vice squad.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Mm-hmm.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
These are people who go out and try and stop people who are doing things that are vices.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh, like drugs and gambling.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Exactly.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Vice squad.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Interesting.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
All right.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And now for the last word on language, take away.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We have this interesting word, a bookie.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
All right.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
So if any of you like to go to the horse races, you might be familiar with this one.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
A bookie is someone who helps you make a bet.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
It's his job to help you make a bet.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Mm-hmm.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Maybe often see it in movies.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Maybe you are betting on a sports competition, right?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
And you are betting on $10 against this team.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
So you would go to a bookie to place your bet because they're not really any legal place

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
where you can do it.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Exactly.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Or if I want to say, okay, tonight, the Chicago Bulls are playing the sons.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
And you want to put $100 on the Chicago Bulls.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
That means they're going to win.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
So you use a bookie.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
And he helps you put the money down.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Now this is a legal, right?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Generally, it's a legal.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Yeah.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
It depends on, I guess you can go to a bookie at the horse races and a legal bet off.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Generally, it's a legal, I think.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Okay.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
So a sports bookie, we would say a sports bookie, right?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Mm-hmm.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Interesting words.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
A lot of words related to, as we said, addictions and vices.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
But that's, I guess, kind of what the whole gambling industry involves, right?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Absolutely.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
All right.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
So now that we've seen those great words on language, take away.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Let's move on now to fluency builder.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Fluency builder.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Okay.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Fluency builder is where we get into some of this really exciting stuff.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
Where we hear some opinions from a person who is not very happy with the gambling industry.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
So this first one, gambling is an industry built on deception.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Okay.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
So it's built on deception.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
So it's an industry.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
So it's not really tangible.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Right.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
So this is a metaphor.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
It's like saying that this industry is dependent on something.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
What does it depend on?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Disception.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Disception.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
So it's deception.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
So to deceive, right?

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
They come from the verb deceive, which basically says, like a false appearance, right?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Not really being completely truthful.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Okay.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
It's really good.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
So a lot of movies that we like to watch or theater is based on deception in a good way.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
Because you get the idea that something is a certain way, but it really isn't in real life.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
So deception is in a theater maybe a good thing.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
In general, deception is a bad thing.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I could say, Marco, I'm sorry.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I deceived you.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
You lied to me.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I lied to you.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
So deception usually involves lies or trying to make something seem like something that

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
it's not.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Right.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Okay.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
So this industry is built on deception.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
And he said that the sole purpose of this industry is to make money.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Exactly.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So this free sole purpose is very, very common.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
You hear this a lot.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
So like your human soul.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Like your human soul is spelled differently.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So you're talking about the one.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
One only.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
So my sole love.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Okay.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I only have one love.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
My sole pair of shoes.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I only have one pair of shoes.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
So it's one thing.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
But the sole purpose.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
So the only reason that this industry exists is what?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
For monetary gain.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
So monetary.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
You might have heard of the International Monetary Fund.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Exactly.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
The IMF.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
And so monetary refers to money.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Money.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
As the door said, it's a gas.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
And the gain, which means basically means making it to get more money.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
So that's the point that this person is making that the sole purpose of the gambling industry is to make money.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Ouch.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
So he's saying there's no other reason to gamble.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
People are in this industry just to make money.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
It's greedy.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, I mean, basically you could probably say that almost about almost all the companies.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Right?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
But about education companies.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
That's different.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Education is very different.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Absolutely.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
So what's another industry that has a sole purpose?

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
For example, non-profit organizations.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Their sole purpose is to help people.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
All right.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Okay.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I can get into that.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Cool.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
And monetary gain.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Very useful phrases.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
But let's take another listen to today's dialogue.

10:18.000 --> 10:26.000
And I put to you some of these great, great new words.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Did you hear?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
Soon you're going to have amazing hotels and casinos here, which will be good for business.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Are you serious?

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Discuss me.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
What are you talking about?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
How does it exploit people?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, to begin with, gambling is addictive.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
That ruins marriages, destroys families, and bankrupt communities.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Once you're addicted, it's very difficult to stop.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
People have lost their houses, cars, and have been left out on the street after becoming addicted.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Secondly, it exploits because,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
and then become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for social interaction.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Geez.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn't become addicted or anything like that.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
You cannot predict who will be committed to gambling.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Now, excuse me.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I have a protest rally to organize.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Alright, so gambling, what are your opinions about it?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Pro, gambling, or anti-gambling?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Okay, well, here's the thing.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Gambling is a sport.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
And some, it involves money, obviously, but people also don't,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I don't think should have other people telling them how to spend their money,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
unless they have some kind of problem.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Right?

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
So, the law doesn't get involved if you have a drinking problem until you're harmful to people around you.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
So, I don't think that it's right for the government to be able to say less than you can't gamble,

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
because it's your own money.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
If it makes you happy, it makes you happy.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Hmm, interesting.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
Now, we've seen very specific cities or places where you can actually gamble in this way.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
You have a monoco or Las Vegas or a cow.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
More recently, right?

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
So, very interesting cities or countries that have been built on the gambling industry,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
which apparently is a multi-billion dollar industry.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Hmm, I'm sorry.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't know.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
What do you think?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Do you, are you against gambling?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Are you for gambling?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I mean, is it one of those things that you can really,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
or do you maybe even like it?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Maybe some people don't even really care for it.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
They don't find it fun to play blackjack or go to the,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
play a round of poker or something like that.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Yeah, well, that's their problem.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I enjoy it.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I guess fun.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
I mean, as long as, with anything, you do it in moderation.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I mean, you don't do it too much.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
I think it's okay.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
All right.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
