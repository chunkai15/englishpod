00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco and I'm Erica and where are we going today, Erica, to the Pharmacy?

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
All right, to the Pharmacy or drugstore? Yes, or also in British English sometimes people say the chemist.

00:17.000 --> 00:25.000
That's right. So as you know, at the pharmacy you get medicine, but there are certain vocabulary words that are related to this place that we need to learn.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
That's right. So we're going to learn some vocabulary about medicine and also some interesting phrases.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
So before we listen to the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
The vocabulary preview.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
We're going to look at two words today that you'll hear in the dialogue.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
And the first one, milligrams.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
milligrams.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
milligrams.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Also the abbreviation for this is mg. That's right.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay. So a milligram is a hundredth of a gram.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
There are 100 milligrams in a gram.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Exactly. And it's very common to be used with medicine, right?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Exactly by medicine in milligrams.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Okay. And what's our next word?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Price check.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
A price check.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
A price check.

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
Okay. So at the pharmacy or at the supermarket, sometimes the cashier will ask for a price check.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
And that is the action of checking to find out the price.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Okay. So a price check.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
With this, I think we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
And let's see what our shopper is buying at the pharmacy.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Hello, sir. How can I help you?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Yes. I need this prescription, please.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Let's see.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Okay. So 50 milligrams of prosack.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Capitals are right.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay. You should take one capsule three times a day.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach and also don't ever mix it with alcohol.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Oh, yes. I know. It's not the first time I'm taking this.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Don't worry. I bought overdose.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Okay. Anything else I can get you?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, yes. I almost forgot.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Can I also get some eyedrops and some condoms?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Sure.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Darn, condoms aren't registered in our system.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, well, that's okay. I'll get some later. Thanks. Really? It's no problem.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Just hang on there, a sec.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Can I get a price check on fun times, rib condoms, please?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Oh, no. How embarrassing.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
A little bit embarrassing that she asked for a price check on these condoms, right?

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, but you know what? It seems like every time you have to buy something embarrassing at the pharmacy,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
there's a million people watching.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah, yeah. It never fails.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah. Well, let's take a look at some of those words that we were talking about related to medicine in language takeaway.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Language takeaway.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
All right. Well, the first word, a prescription.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Prescription.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Prescription.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
All right. So what is a prescription?

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Well, a prescription is a note from your doctor explaining what medicine you need.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
So this notes from your doctor is necessary to buy that medicine, right?

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Exactly. Okay. Prescription. Well, this shopper was getting some medicine and

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
well, the chemist or the pharmacist asked if you wanted it in capsules or tablets.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
So let's look at those two words on capsule capsule.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Now, a capsule is like a small tube, right?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah. It's a form of a pill.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Mm-hmm.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
And it's shaped like a tube with the medicine inside.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Inside and it's covered in plastic, right?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Exactly. Now, you swallow the capsule.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yep.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
And the tablet is like a pill that is round and flat.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Okay.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
So tablet and capsule both are the same thing basically, but just different presentation.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Different shapes, different shapes.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah. It's easier maybe to for some people to swallow a capsule.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
You think so?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I don't know. I think so.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, because sometimes tablets are a little bit like big circles and it's hard to swallow.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah. And I guess capsules are smoother.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah, exactly.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
But we're not pharmacists. So let's move on and focus on the language,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
which is what we do know about.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
So the pharmacist warned the patient not to take too much medicine, right?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Mm-hmm.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Because he might overdose.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
overdose.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Okay. So to overdose, like you said,

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
is to take too much medicine and get really sick or even die.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Mm-hmm.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
So if you overdose on medicine, it could be bad for you instead of good.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, obviously very bad.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
And what about our last word for today?

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Well, the shopper also asked for some eye drops.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Eye drops.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Eye drops.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
So this is medicine for your eyes.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, usually liquid, like water that you put in your eyes.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Okay.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So I think now with this medicine language clear,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
we can listen to our dialogue again,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
but it's going to be slowed down a little bit.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
That'll help us understand these phrases just a little bit better.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Hello, sir.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
How can I help you?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Yes.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I need this prescription, please.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Let's see.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Okay.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
So 50 milligrams of prosak.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Capsules are fine.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Okay.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
You should take one capsule three times a day.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach,

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
and also don't ever mix it with alcohol.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Yes, I know.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
It's not the first time I'm taking this.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Don't worry.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I won't overdose.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Okay.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Anything else I can get you?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh, yes.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I almost forgot.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Can I get some eye drops and some condoms?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Sure.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Darn condoms aren't registered in our system.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Oh, well, that's okay.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I'll get some later.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Thanks.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Really, it's no problem.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Just hang on there, a sec.

06:22.000 --> 06:32.000
Can I get a price check on fun times ribbed condoms, please?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Okay.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
So now it's time for us to take a look at some of the phrases that we saw in this dialogue

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
and putting it together.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Let's get together.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
We're going to look at two phrases here,

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
and we're going to see how we can use them in different situations.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
The pharmacist warned, be sure not to take it on an empty stomach.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Okay.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
So be sure not to.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Be sure not to.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
So what does he mean by this?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
He just means don't do this.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Okay.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
So don't don't take the medicine without eating.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
We can mix it up a little bit.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use this in different situations?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Example one.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Be sure not to leave your bike outside or it will be stolen.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Example two.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Be sure not to forget your umbrella.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
It's raining today.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Example three.

07:34.000 --> 07:43.000
I told him to be sure not to do anything stupid, but he did.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
So Marco, why should we say be sure not to instead of don't?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
I think don't is sounds more like an order.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Okay.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Very direct.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Maybe be sure not to is a little bit softer,

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
a little bit more friendly.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
So be sure not to.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Now for our last phrase.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So the pharmacist in the end wanted to check for the price,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
and he said, just hang on there a sec.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
So that's interesting.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Hang on.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Hang on.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Hang on.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Well hang on.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
What does he mean by hang on?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
He means wait.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Wait.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It's a informal way of saying wait.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Exactly.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
It's also a little bit more friendly than just saying wait.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Right.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Exactly.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
And we can change the time a little bit, right?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So you can say hang on a second.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Or hang on a moment.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Hang on a minute.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
All right.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
What about hang on an hour?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Well maybe if you're telling someone to wait for an hour,

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
just hang on there for an hour.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I'll be there soon.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
But I guess it's more common.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Hang on a minute.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Right.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Maybe for shorter periods of time.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Okay.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
So what these phrases, I think now we can use them in different circumstances,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
obviously not only in the pharmacy.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yeah.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
And well, let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Hello, sir.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
How can I help you?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yes.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I need this prescription, please.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Let's see.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Okay.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
So 50 milligrams of prosack.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Capsules are right.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
You should take one capsule three times a day.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
and also don't ever mix it with alcohol.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Oh, yes, I know.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
It's not the first time I'm taking this.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Don't worry.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
I bought overdose.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Okay.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Anything else I can get you?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Oh, yes.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I almost forgot.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Can I also get some eye drops and some condoms?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Sure.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Tharn condoms aren't registered in our system.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Oh, well.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
That's okay.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I'll get some later.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Thanks.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Really?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
It's no problem.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Just hang on there, sir.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Can I get a price check on?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Fun times, rib condoms, please.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Okay.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
So with medicine, an interesting thing comes up, right?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
That's right.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
A lot of people think that you eat medicine.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Okay.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Or drink medicine?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
But in English, you always take medicine.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Always take medicine.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
So you never can say, oh, I ate my medicine yesterday.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
It always has to be.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I took my medicine.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Okay.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
You take the capsules.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Exactly.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Or take the tablets.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
All right.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
So you take medicine now.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
An interesting thing in the United States, for example, it's very hard to get medicine

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
without a prescription.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
That's right.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
So we always talk about prescription medicine and OTC medicine or over the counter medicine.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
So over the counter medicine is.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
Is medicine you can just buy without that prescription or note from your doctor?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Okay.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
So for example, if you have a headache, you can go to the pharmacy and buy aspirin.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And that's over the counter medicine.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
But prescription medicine.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
You can't get it without the doctor's note.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yes.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
And like you said in America, you almost have to have a prescription for everything.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Which is strange because people can overdose on aspirin.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
So tell us how medicine and pharmacies work in your countries.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
