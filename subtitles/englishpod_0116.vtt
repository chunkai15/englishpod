00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
Hello English learners, welcome back to another advanced lesson here at English Pod,

00:07.760 --> 00:12.640
my name is Marco. And I'm Erica. And today we're going to be back in the office.

00:12.640 --> 00:18.880
That's right. We are listening in as somebody gets a little bit of trouble from their boss

00:18.880 --> 00:24.000
for being a bit late on a project. All right. So we're going to be at the office. Somebody misses

00:24.000 --> 00:30.640
a deadline. And so, well, how do you handle the situation? What can you do to explain yourself?

00:30.640 --> 00:35.360
And what language can you actually use to talk about mis-dead lines and late work?

00:35.920 --> 00:41.840
All right. So let's see why this person missed the deadline and let's find out what happens.

00:41.840 --> 00:56.640
And so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project.

00:56.640 --> 01:01.760
As you know, you missed a fairly significant deadline last week and this will negatively impact

01:01.760 --> 01:05.920
the team's ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.800
I know. I'm really sorry that I missed a deadline. But really, it wasn't my fault.

01:10.800 --> 01:15.840
You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute. And I couldn't get

01:15.840 --> 01:20.720
into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.920
You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept to CRM stable,

01:25.920 --> 01:31.040
then I wouldn't have missed my deadline. Oh, come on. And excuse like that is tantamount to

01:31.040 --> 01:36.400
lying. You're essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues rather than

01:36.400 --> 01:41.520
accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.

01:41.520 --> 01:46.480
No, I'm not trying to pass the buck here. I know it was me who was ultimately responsible for

01:46.480 --> 01:52.320
getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn't gone down.

01:52.320 --> 01:57.040
And you know, with everything I've got going on now, I can't afford to waste time dealing with

01:57.040 --> 02:01.760
technical problems. I've got a lot of my plate. And there are only 24 hours in a day.

02:01.760 --> 02:08.560
I'm not going to accept this excuse. You're using these small technical glitches as a crutch

02:08.560 --> 02:13.040
and trying to rationalize the fact that you've missed your deadline. Look, we have standards

02:13.040 --> 02:18.880
and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phony excuses. If you're in over your

02:18.880 --> 02:25.200
head, you tell me no more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by 9 a.m.

02:33.440 --> 02:38.240
Well, it sounds like this guy isn't really accepting a lot of the responsibility for his

02:38.240 --> 02:44.400
missed deadline. Exactly. Well, apparently he's explaining that it wasn't only his fault, right?

02:44.480 --> 02:49.760
Yep. So some technical problems. But, you know, he used a lot of pretty, pretty interesting language.

02:49.760 --> 02:55.760
And I think it'll help us to look at that now in language takeaway. Language takeaway.

02:56.640 --> 03:02.160
All right. So on language takeaway today, we have five words and let's start with the first one.

03:02.160 --> 03:08.160
All right. Well, the boss is not really happy with the excuse that the employee was giving.

03:08.160 --> 03:11.840
And he said an excuse like that is tantamount to lying.

03:12.640 --> 03:20.400
Tantamount. Tantamount to something. Okay. So if an excuse like that is tantamount to lying,

03:20.400 --> 03:25.120
what is what is he trying to say here? Basically, it's the same as or it's almost the same as.

03:25.120 --> 03:30.320
So similar to. So if I say tantamount to something else, how would I use it?

03:30.320 --> 03:34.560
You know, Marco, taking my computer without asking is tantamount to stealing.

03:34.560 --> 03:38.720
Okay. So even though I'm not actually stealing and are taking it home with me,

03:39.440 --> 03:44.960
it is almost like stealing. Yeah. And the interesting grammatical thing here is that we almost

03:44.960 --> 03:50.800
always use a gerend right after. So tantamount to verb Ingi. Okay. Tantamount to stealing.

03:50.800 --> 03:57.600
Tantamount to lying. Tantamount to killing. Okay. Well, on that happy note, let's go on to our next

03:57.600 --> 04:05.520
word. Now the boss was really unhappy with the employee for procrastinating. Procrastinating.

04:05.840 --> 04:13.280
So the verb is to procrastinate. And when you procrastinate, you say, oh, I'll do it later.

04:13.280 --> 04:18.400
I'll do it tomorrow. Okay. So you kind of delay things or you leave it for another day.

04:18.400 --> 04:25.760
Yeah. All right. Very good. So two procrastinate. A favorite verb amongst college students.

04:25.760 --> 04:34.000
I actually thought for a little while that procrastinate was to have babies. Oh, okay. It's kind of similar.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.600
What's it? What's the word? Procreate. Procreate. Yeah. So for a while, I always thought that procrastinate

04:39.600 --> 04:44.960
was like having babies like, why are you procrastinating? And I'm like, I'm not. Well, glad you got that

04:44.960 --> 04:51.200
straight. So yes, our listeners procrastinate is not to say as procreate. Okay. I learned that the

04:51.200 --> 04:57.040
hard way. Yes. Well, it sounds like you had a little bit of a glitch in your understanding of

04:57.040 --> 05:02.400
language. And that's our next phrase. So in the dialogue, they were talking about some glitches

05:02.480 --> 05:09.680
with the system. A glitch in the system. Okay. So a glitch. Now this is a common among computers.

05:09.680 --> 05:14.640
Right. A glitch is an an error. Right. So when you're talking about a glitch and you're talking

05:14.640 --> 05:20.640
about computers, it's an error, a mistake. But we also use it to talk about any unexpected problem,

05:20.640 --> 05:26.640
a small and expected problem. Okay. So a small glitch. Yeah. There was a glitch in our plan and we

05:26.800 --> 05:33.280
arrived 10 minutes late. Or I can say this movie has a glitch in the story. So there's a small

05:33.280 --> 05:39.680
problem in the story that doesn't make sense. Exactly. All right. So the employee was blaming his

05:39.680 --> 05:44.800
lateness on on these small technical glitches. But the boss didn't believe this, right?

05:45.600 --> 05:51.360
The boss said, you're trying to rationalize the fact that you missed the deadline. Okay.

05:51.360 --> 05:58.240
To rationalize. To rationalize. So the boss is saying that he's trying to rationalize. So that

05:58.240 --> 06:06.000
means he's trying to make sense of it. Well, this is an interesting psychological word. And when

06:06.000 --> 06:12.400
you rationalize something, you think about it or describe it, like especially some bad behavior

06:12.400 --> 06:20.400
in a way that makes it seem better or proper or more sensible. So you're trying to convince yourself.

06:20.480 --> 06:24.800
Yeah. You're telling other people, but you're also telling yourself that it's better. Okay.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.600
Or that you're right when you're actually wrong. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So he was trying to

06:29.600 --> 06:34.640
rationalize the fact that he missed the deadline. So he was trying to explain to the boss and also

06:34.640 --> 06:40.240
kind of make himself believe that it wasn't really his fault when it was. Now because this

06:40.240 --> 06:45.040
is a little bit of a difficult concept to understand, I think we should hear some examples.

06:45.120 --> 06:51.200
Example one, you can't rationalize your sense behavior by saying he's going through a hard time.

06:53.200 --> 06:59.760
Example two. As much as I tried, I couldn't rationalize buying such an expensive pair of shoes.

07:01.760 --> 07:08.080
Example three. You know it was the wrong thing to do. Stop trying to rationalize it.

07:09.440 --> 07:13.840
Okay. So clear as daylight now, this word rationalize.

07:14.480 --> 07:20.320
All right. In our final word, so the boss really wasn't happy with these excuses and he said,

07:20.320 --> 07:31.680
no more phony excuses. Okay. Phony phony. PH-O-N-Y phony. So phony is basically false or fake.

07:31.680 --> 07:37.280
Right. So a phony statement. Mm-hmm. A phony watch. Okay. A fake watch. Yeah. Not a

07:37.280 --> 07:43.520
phony watch, but phony watch. A phony. So a lot of great words in this dialogue, but as you mentioned,

07:43.520 --> 07:49.840
we also saw some very interesting phrases that we can use in situations like this. So why don't we

07:49.840 --> 07:57.040
start now with fluency builder? Fluency builder. Well, you know, one of the interesting things

07:57.040 --> 08:03.840
about English is that we have a lot of ways to make things sound more direct, less direct harder,

08:03.840 --> 08:10.400
or softer. And in this dialogue, there are a few examples of how we use softening words to,

08:10.960 --> 08:17.120
but to do the opposite to actually make it a little strong. Okay. So why don't we start with the first

08:17.120 --> 08:23.120
paragraph. In the first part of the dialogue, he said, you missed a fairly significant deadline.

08:23.120 --> 08:29.280
A fairly significant deadline. Now, this word fairly kind of sort of. So it's not very

08:29.360 --> 08:34.720
significant. It's kind of significant. Yeah. But in this context, when the person is saying it,

08:34.720 --> 08:40.320
it just sounds a little bit softer, but your understanding is. It's a very important deadline.

08:40.320 --> 08:47.440
Okay. A very important deadline. So another similar example of this is the boss was saying,

08:47.440 --> 08:54.000
you're essentially blaming the tech team. Okay. You're essentially blaming. So essentially is like

08:54.000 --> 09:01.520
basically or pretty much. So it sounds a little softer, but what he's actually really saying is

09:01.520 --> 09:06.800
you're doing this. Right. So instead of saying you're blaming the tech team, he adds this word

09:06.800 --> 09:12.880
essentially to kind of say, well, basically you're saying it's their fault. Yeah. But the context

09:12.880 --> 09:17.840
or you understand that it's actually very direct and he's saying it's your fault. Yeah. So he's saying

09:17.840 --> 09:22.000
you're almost blaming the tech team, but what he means is you're blaming the tech team.

09:22.960 --> 09:28.240
Now our third phrase is very interesting because it's kind of like a saying. That's right. So the

09:28.240 --> 09:34.000
employee says, I'm not trying to pass the buck here. I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.320
I'm not trying to pass the buck. Now what's the buck? A dollar bill. A dollar bill. So he's

09:40.320 --> 09:45.760
understand that he's saying I'm not trying to blame somebody else or pass the blame onto someone else.

09:46.800 --> 09:51.280
But you can think about it like this. Like imagine he had some fake or phony money, right?

09:51.440 --> 09:56.080
And he wants to pass that on to the next person. So he doesn't get in trouble. Okay. So I'm not

09:56.080 --> 10:01.840
trying to pass the buck. I'm not trying to pass the blame. Put the responsibility on someone else.

10:01.840 --> 10:07.600
Very good. But you know what? You know what he really means here? What? I am trying to do that.

10:07.600 --> 10:12.000
Because he knew. Yeah. He knew that it was a fake dollar bill. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

10:12.640 --> 10:20.240
Now the fourth one is interesting as well because it's kind of like a metaphor. He said the boss said,

10:20.400 --> 10:26.480
you're using the small technical glitches as a crutch. So using something as a crutch.

10:26.480 --> 10:33.280
Now the crutch is a, you know, when you break your leg, you use those wooden or metal

10:33.280 --> 10:38.480
sticks to walk with. Okay. To help you walk. Yeah. So the boss is basically saying you're using

10:38.480 --> 10:45.200
these technical glitches as an excuse or as an aid to why you missed a deadline. Yeah. So if you

10:45.200 --> 10:49.680
think about it like this, some people might say, okay, if you walk with a crutch, then you,

10:50.240 --> 10:58.080
you won't succeed, right? Because whatever. So this guy, this employee, is basically saying,

10:58.080 --> 11:02.880
yes, I know that I should meet deadlines, but these these problems these glitches are like my

11:02.880 --> 11:08.640
crutch that make me not succeed. Okay. So he's trying to just make excuses. So,

11:09.280 --> 11:12.800
God, Mark, that does a little bit difficult to understand. Do you think we should give a couple more

11:12.880 --> 11:17.840
examples? Yeah. I think I think some more examples would be very useful. So let's

11:17.840 --> 11:25.920
listen to a couple of them now. Example one. I realized that I was using alcohol as a crutch to get

11:25.920 --> 11:34.480
through the day. Example two. I think bills very capable of being successful, but he uses his

11:34.560 --> 11:44.000
disability as a crutch. Example three. Stop using your weight as a crutch. Just because

11:44.000 --> 11:51.360
your bit fat doesn't mean you can't get a great job. All right. So a lot of great phrases,

11:51.360 --> 11:56.800
great words, and well, I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for the last time,

11:56.800 --> 12:00.960
and then we'll come back and talk about this aspect of meeting deadlines.

12:05.440 --> 12:12.720
And so I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project.

12:12.720 --> 12:17.920
As you know, you missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negatively impact

12:17.920 --> 12:24.160
the team's ability to move forward with the next stages of this project. I know. I'm really sorry

12:24.160 --> 12:29.120
that I missed a deadline, but really, it wasn't my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected

12:29.120 --> 12:33.840
technical problems at the last minute, and I couldn't get into the database and extract the

12:33.840 --> 12:39.360
kind of information that I needed for the data analysis. You know, if the tech guys would have

12:39.360 --> 12:45.360
done their job and kept to CRM stable, then I wouldn't have missed my deadline. Oh, come on,

12:45.360 --> 12:50.720
and excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You're essentially blaming the tech team for your

12:50.720 --> 12:56.240
time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating

12:56.240 --> 13:01.440
for the past two weeks. No, I'm not trying to pass the buck here. I know it was me who was

13:01.520 --> 13:06.400
ultimately responsible for getting this done, but the thing is, I could have finished on time

13:06.400 --> 13:12.080
if the system hadn't gone down. And you know, with everything I've got going on now, I can't afford

13:12.080 --> 13:16.880
to waste time dealing with technical problems. I've got a lot of my plate, and there are only 24

13:16.880 --> 13:23.520
hours in a day. I'm not going to accept this excuse. You're using these small technical glitches

13:23.520 --> 13:28.640
as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you've missed your deadline. Look, we have

13:28.640 --> 13:34.720
standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phony excuses. If you're in

13:34.720 --> 13:41.440
over your head, you tell me no more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by 9 a.m.

13:47.440 --> 13:52.560
This employee got in a lot of trouble from missing his deadline. Exactly. I think it's a very

13:52.560 --> 14:00.320
important aspect of not only Western culture, but also in general, assuming guilt when it's

14:00.320 --> 14:06.800
your fault. In this case, we saw that the employee didn't really want to accept the fact that he,

14:06.800 --> 14:13.040
it was his fault. Yeah, he didn't say, yeah, I know it was me. I'm sorry, and this is my plan to fix it.

14:13.040 --> 14:18.160
Now, this is very important among cultures because in some cultures, the aspect of

14:18.240 --> 14:23.920
losing face is so important, right? Right. So somebody may not really want to assume guilt or

14:23.920 --> 14:29.120
they have to because it's part of the culture. But what's the standard in North American business

14:29.120 --> 14:34.400
practice? I would say that you would have to assume the responsibility and take

14:34.400 --> 14:39.040
responsibility for your actions, right? And say, yes, it's my fault. I did it, but I'm going to get

14:39.040 --> 14:45.840
it fixed or I'll do it or I'll make up for it. So some good, some good business tips here today

14:45.840 --> 14:51.120
in this lesson. Now, remember, if you have any questions about the language or want to tell us a

14:51.120 --> 14:57.520
little bit about how you assume responsibility in your culture, visit our website at EnglishPod.com.

14:57.520 --> 15:02.800
Right. We're always there to help you out and until next time. Thanks for listening and goodbye.
