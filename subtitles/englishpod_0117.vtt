00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marko.

00:05.800 --> 00:13.100
And I'm Erica. And today we're bringing you part nine of our romantic drama suspense action series.

00:13.100 --> 00:17.500
I'm sorry. I love you. This is actually our penultimate lesson.

00:17.500 --> 00:22.700
Exactly. This story will end in part 10. So we're almost done. What's happening?

00:23.700 --> 00:29.300
Well, I am pretty excited to find out. So why don't we go straight into the dialogue and catch up with

00:29.300 --> 00:31.300
Steven and Veronica?

00:37.300 --> 00:41.300
Veronica wait. Come on, honey. Get back in the car. Let's talk it over, okay?

00:41.300 --> 00:46.300
No. I'm tired of your lies. I don't know who you are anymore.

00:46.300 --> 00:50.300
Veronica, it's me. The man that has and always will love you.

00:50.300 --> 00:54.300
I'm sorry that I've lied to you. Believe me. It's been hard for me as well.

00:54.300 --> 00:59.300
And time and again, I've thought of coming clean, but I couldn't put you or my mission at risk.

00:59.300 --> 01:03.300
It's all over now. My assignment is complete. And now I have to go back to India.

01:03.300 --> 01:09.300
What? Are you kidding? Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

01:09.300 --> 01:11.300
How could you deceive me like that?

01:11.300 --> 01:19.300
Yes. Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time and you probably hate me right now,

01:19.300 --> 01:26.300
but I want to be completely forthright with you. I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

01:26.300 --> 01:32.300
Veronica, who are you marrying me? Come with me to India, baby.

01:32.300 --> 01:36.300
I can't make it for everything that's happened, but I can promise you my undying love.

01:36.300 --> 01:41.300
I will be the most devoted husband and I will cherish you always.

01:41.300 --> 01:46.300
Stephen, I can't just leave everything in the drop of a hat.

01:46.300 --> 01:50.300
With everything that has happened between us, I just don't know you anymore.

01:50.300 --> 01:58.300
I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies. I do love you, but I can't go with you.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.300
I'm sorry. I love you.

02:00.300 --> 02:15.300
This is the last call for flight 815 from Los Angeles to Hyderabad.

02:15.300 --> 02:22.300
I'm sorry, sorry. We can't wait any longer. You must board the plane. Are you waiting for someone?

02:22.300 --> 02:26.300
I was, but I don't think she's coming.

02:30.300 --> 02:43.300
Alright, so it seems like our poor Stephen is going home by himself.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.300
Oh, it's so sad.

02:45.300 --> 02:50.300
I know he proposed she didn't accept and now he's going back to India by himself.

02:50.300 --> 02:54.300
You know, I think this must be one of the worst feelings in the world.

02:54.300 --> 03:00.300
I'm wondering if the person you love is going to show up at the last minute and realizing they aren't.

03:00.300 --> 03:05.300
I think it's very common of movies. You always expect the person to come running and show up.

03:05.300 --> 03:10.300
But as you can see, our dialogues are more realistic, so it didn't happen in this case.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.300
Or realistic.

03:11.300 --> 03:19.300
Anyway, let's not debate that topic. Let's go straight into the language now with language takeaway.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.300
Language takeaway.

03:23.300 --> 03:29.300
Alright, so today on language takeaway, we have six words that we're going to be looking at and let's get started with the first one.

03:29.300 --> 03:34.300
Okay, so we've got language about love and language about telling the truth.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.300
And the first one is a word about telling the truth.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.300
So Stephen said, I've thought of coming clean.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.300
Okay, to come clean.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.300
To come clean.

03:44.300 --> 03:48.300
Now, if I want to come clean, it means I want to.

03:48.300 --> 03:53.300
I don't admit to something or to tell the truth about something you've been hiding.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.300
Exactly, okay, so I want to finally tell the truth or confess.

03:58.300 --> 04:02.300
So someone needs to come clean about who stole the chocolate out of the kitchen.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.300
Okay, come clean.

04:04.300 --> 04:10.300
So Stephen wanted to come clean on many occasions, but Veronica said, how could you deceive me like that?

04:10.300 --> 04:12.300
To deceive someone.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.300
How could you deceive me?

04:14.300 --> 04:16.300
So to deceive someone.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.300
To deceive.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.300
You want to deceive somebody.

04:20.300 --> 04:24.300
You make them believe something that is untrue.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.300
So you kind of trick them.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.300
Yeah, yeah.

04:27.300 --> 04:31.300
Okay, make them believe or see something that is not really true.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.300
Exactly.

04:32.300 --> 04:35.300
Alright, so that's the verb to deceive.

04:35.300 --> 04:39.300
Now the noun, the action of doing this is called deception.

04:39.300 --> 04:42.300
It was all a great deception.

04:42.300 --> 04:45.300
Okay, so a big trick, something a big untruth.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.300
You deceived me.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.300
Alright, very good.

04:49.300 --> 04:54.300
Now the opposite of deceive is to be fourth right.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.300
Fourth right.

04:55.300 --> 04:59.300
So Stephen wants to be completely fourth right with Veronica.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.300
Okay, I want to be fourth right with you.

05:02.300 --> 05:07.300
Alright, when you are fourth right with somebody, you are very honest and truthful with them, right?

05:07.300 --> 05:08.300
Direct.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.300
You tell them the truth and everything directly.

05:10.300 --> 05:13.300
And you don't, so you don't like hide it or soften it or anything.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.300
Very good.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.300
So fourth right.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.300
Hmm.

05:17.300 --> 05:20.300
Alright, so three words about honesty.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.300
Now we've got three words about love for you.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.300
So Stephen promised Veronica his undying love.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.300
My undying love.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.300
My undying love.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.300
Now undying.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.300
Well, I think it's pretty easy, right?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.300
It won't die.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.300
It won't die, exactly.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.300
Yeah.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.300
So he's offering her his for his love forever.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.300
Mm-hmm.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.300
A very romantic phrase.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.300
Very romantic.

05:43.300 --> 05:46.300
And he also promised to be a devoted husband.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.300
Divided husband.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.300
I'll be the most devoted husband.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.300
Now this word devoted, what am I saying there?

05:52.300 --> 05:57.300
So as a devoted husband, Stephen really, really would love his wife.

05:57.300 --> 06:03.300
He'd really look after her well and he would put all of his energy into that into his marriage, right?

06:03.300 --> 06:06.300
Okay, so he would be very committed to her.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.300
Mm-hmm.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.300
And work really hard.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.300
Now can I change the noun husband for something else?

06:11.300 --> 06:14.300
Yeah, we can talk about a devoted friend.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.300
Or a devoted father.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.300
Or a devoted employee.

06:17.300 --> 06:18.300
Very good.

06:18.300 --> 06:21.300
And our last word about love.

06:21.300 --> 06:25.300
Well, Stephen also promises to cherish Veronica.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.300
Okay, I will cherish you always.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.300
I will cherish you always.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.300
So if I cherish somebody like my girlfriend, what would that mean?

06:33.300 --> 06:35.300
I mean, you hold her in your heart.

06:35.300 --> 06:39.300
Like you really love her and you really respect her and you hold her close in your heart.

06:40.300 --> 06:44.300
Okay, so I respect her and maybe you don't take that person for granted.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.300
Mm-hmm.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.300
Okay, to cherish someone.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.300
Yeah.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.300
All right, so some nice honesty words, some nice love words.

06:51.300 --> 06:56.300
And I think now we can move on to some interesting phrases with Fluency Builder.

06:56.300 --> 06:58.300
Fluency Builder.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.300
All right, so Veronica was upset.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.300
She didn't want to get in back in the car.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.300
And Stephen said, let's talk it over, okay?

07:06.300 --> 07:08.300
Let's talk it over.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.300
To talk something over.

07:10.300 --> 07:15.300
Now, if I tell you that I want to talk it over, what am I saying?

07:15.300 --> 07:17.300
Well, obviously you want to talk about it, right?

07:17.300 --> 07:18.300
Mm-hmm.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.300
But you want to talk about it for some time.

07:21.300 --> 07:25.300
So really talk about all of the problems and the issues and everything.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.300
So to try and make things clear.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.300
Exactly.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.300
All right.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.300
And also when he was confessing, he said,

07:31.300 --> 07:34.300
Time and again, I thought of coming clean.

07:34.300 --> 07:37.300
So this phrase, time and again.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.300
Time and again.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.300
Time and again.

07:39.300 --> 07:43.300
So that's basically the same as saying again and again or many times.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.300
Right.

07:44.300 --> 07:49.300
So time and again, I've thought of quitting smoking, but never really have done it.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.300
So you've thought many times of doing it.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.300
Mm-hmm.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.300
Time and again.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.300
Yep.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.300
All right, so let's go to our next phrase.

07:56.300 --> 08:01.300
Now Veronica said, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.300
At the drop of a hat.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.300
At the drop of a hat.

08:04.300 --> 08:09.300
So this is a very interesting and colloquial way of saying immediately.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.300
Mm-hmm.

08:10.300 --> 08:15.300
So why don't we hear a few examples of how this is used in English?

08:15.300 --> 08:17.300
Example one.

08:17.300 --> 08:21.300
My boss expects me to come into work at the drop of a hat.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.300
Example two.

08:23.300 --> 08:27.300
Laura's always willing to help me at the drop of a hat.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.300
Example three.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.300
I can't leave at the drop of a hat.

08:32.300 --> 08:34.300
I need time to prepare.

08:34.300 --> 08:37.300
Okay, so as you can see, you can change it for different things,

08:37.300 --> 08:40.300
but basically you're saying I can't do something immediately.

08:40.300 --> 08:45.300
Yeah, and it is almost always attached this idea of doing something or going somewhere,

08:45.300 --> 08:46.300
being somewhere.

08:46.300 --> 08:47.300
Mm-hmm.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.300
Very good at the drop of a hat.

08:48.300 --> 08:52.300
All right, now our final phrase here for this lesson.

08:52.300 --> 08:56.300
So Veronica was saying, I can't go to India at the drop of a hat.

08:56.300 --> 09:01.300
And she also said, I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.300
Okay, a foundation of lies.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.300
To build something on a foundation of lies.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.300
Now, this is interesting.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.300
Let's take a look at this.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.300
A foundation.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.300
What is that?

09:11.300 --> 09:12.300
Well, you know you have a house, right?

09:12.300 --> 09:13.300
Mm-hmm.

09:13.300 --> 09:17.300
And the part that's in the ground that supports the house is the foundation.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.300
Okay, so it supports the entire structure.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.300
Right.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.300
So here she refers to the lies as the foundation.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.300
Mm-hmm.

09:25.300 --> 09:28.300
And that's no way to start a strong relationship, is it?

09:28.300 --> 09:29.300
Exactly.

09:29.300 --> 09:35.300
So we use it metaphorically in this way, but we can always, but we always have to say it,

09:35.300 --> 09:37.300
but we always have to use the verb build.

09:37.300 --> 09:42.300
Okay, so it's basically to make something on a base of something else, right?

09:42.300 --> 09:48.300
So for example, a strong relationship is built on a foundation of trust.

09:48.300 --> 09:53.300
Or this country was built on a foundation of liberty.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.300
Very good.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.300
So always use foundation with built.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.300
Mm-hmm.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.300
Very good.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.300
Very interesting.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.300
And well, I think we should listen to this dialogue before the last time.

10:02.300 --> 10:13.300
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about Veronica and Steven.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.300
Veronica, wait.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.300
Come on, honey.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.300
Get back in the car.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.300
Let's talk it over, okay?

10:17.300 --> 10:18.300
No.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.300
I'm tired of your lies.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.300
I don't know who you are anymore.

10:22.300 --> 10:23.300
Veronica, it's me.

10:23.300 --> 10:26.300
The man that has and always will love you.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.300
I'm sorry that I've lied to you, believe me.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.300
It's been hard for me as well.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.300
And time and again, I've thought of coming clean.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.300
But I couldn't put you or my mission at risk.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.300
It's all over now.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.300
My assignment is complete.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.300
And now I have to go back to India.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.300
What?

10:40.300 --> 10:41.300
Are you kidding?

10:41.300 --> 10:44.300
Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

10:44.300 --> 10:47.300
How could you deceive me like that?

10:47.300 --> 10:48.300
Yes.

10:48.300 --> 10:53.300
Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time

10:53.300 --> 10:55.300
and you probably hate me right now.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.300
I want to be completely forthright with you.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.300
I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing

11:00.300 --> 11:02.300
that has ever happened to me.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.300
Veronica, will you marry me?

11:05.300 --> 11:07.300
Come with me to India, baby.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.300
I can't make it for everything that's happened

11:09.300 --> 11:12.300
but I can promise you my undying love.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.300
I will be the most devoted husband

11:14.300 --> 11:16.300
and I will cherish you always.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.300
Steven.

11:18.300 --> 11:21.300
I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat

11:21.300 --> 11:23.300
with everything that has happened between us.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.300
I just don't know you anymore.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.300
I just can't build a relationship

11:28.300 --> 11:30.300
on a foundation of lies.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.300
I do love you, but I can't go with you.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.300
I'm sorry.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.300
I love you.

11:44.300 --> 11:48.300
This is the last call for flight 18 from Los Angeles

11:48.300 --> 11:50.300
to Hyderabad.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.300
I'm sorry, sir.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.300
We can't wait any longer.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.300
You must board the plane.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.300
Are you waiting for someone?

11:57.300 --> 12:01.300
I was, but I don't think she's coming.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.300
So Marco, I think I see a bit of a tear there

12:16.300 --> 12:18.300
in the corner of your eye.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.300
I'm very sad.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.300
I can't believe he proposed and she just said no.

12:22.300 --> 12:23.300
Just like that.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.300
I'm not supposed to happen.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.300
And plus, he was inviting her to India

12:26.300 --> 12:28.300
and exotic getaway and...

12:28.300 --> 12:33.300
Well, exotic getaway for the rest of her life.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.300
Well, what do you think will happen?

12:35.300 --> 12:37.300
Part 10, it all ends.

12:37.300 --> 12:41.300
So do you think they all just keep on living their separate lives?

12:41.300 --> 12:43.300
Will they meet again?

12:43.300 --> 12:44.300
Who knows?

12:44.300 --> 12:47.300
