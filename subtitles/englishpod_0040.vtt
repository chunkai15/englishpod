00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson today.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
One that takes place at the office.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Yes.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Today we're going to teach you some great phrases so that you can ask people to help you.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Right.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
And I think this dialogue is with a new person at the office.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
So when you're new, you always need to ask people for favor.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Exactly.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Okay.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
So we're going to be asking for a favor.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
So Marco, what exactly is a favor?

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Something that a person does for you.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Like a small, helpful thing.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Yeah, a small, helpful thing.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
So, you know, like, can you pass me that pencil?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Maybe that's even a favor.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Or maybe, can you pick me up on your way to work?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah, that's a favor.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Or even lending money to your friend.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Yeah.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
That's a favor.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Yeah.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
So that's what we're going to be talking about favors and how to ask for one.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Because you always have to do this at work.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
And work with your friends, with your family.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all the vocabulary.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Sorry to bother you.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
My name is Rachel.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm new here.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Can I ask you for a favor?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Hi, Rachel.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Welcome on board.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Excuse me.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
But can I bother you for a second?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
You know what?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I'd love to help you.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
But I'm about to meet an important client.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Do I ask Sean instead?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Please, it's right over there.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Sorry to interrupt you, Sean.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Could you do me a quick favor?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Actually, I'm working in a document that's been a couple of minutes.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I really can't talk right now.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Sorry about that.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Geez.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I just want to know where the bathroom is.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
What's wrong with you, people?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So a pretty busy office.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Pretty unhelpful colleagues.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I know everyone's so busy.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
They didn't help this poor girl.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I hope she found the bathroom.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Now let's take a look at the language from the dialogue.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
So let's start with language takeaway.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Language takeaway.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
No.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I hope she found the bathroom.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Now let's take a look at the language from the dialogue.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
So let's start with language takeaway.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Language takeaway.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
There's some great language in the dialogue, wasn't there?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah, a lot of interesting phrases and words.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
The first one that I saw that was really interesting is unbored.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Unbored.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Welcome, unbored.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, we've got some examples of how this phrase is used.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
So let's listen to them to help us understand the meaning.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Example one.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Welcome on board, Sarah.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Example two.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
We need to get our new office assistant on board as soon as possible.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Example three.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
We decided to bring Melissa on board to join the marketing team.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
So basically it means welcome to the company.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Welcome to the company.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
The team.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Welcome on board.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
So on board is the same as to the company.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
I guess also when you get on a ship they'll tell you welcome on board.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
That's where it comes from.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Or an airplane.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Welcome on board.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Okay.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Let's take a look at our next word.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
About two.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
About two.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm about two.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I'm about two.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
So this is a great phrase to explain that you're about to do something.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I'm going to do this thing really soon.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Okay.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
So for example, you can say,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm about to go out for lunch.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Mm-hmm.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Or I could say, hey, Marco, let's go record a show.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm about to go into a meeting.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Mm-hmm.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Exactly.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Yeah.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
About two.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Going to do something really soon.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Okay.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
The next word we have is instead.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Instead.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Instead.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Instead.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Instead.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It means in the place up.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
In the place up.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yep.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
So for example, if we're at dinner, I could say,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I'll have the chicken instead of the fish.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Mm-hmm.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Right.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Or I can say, I wanted to buy a red sweater,

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
but they didn't have one.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
So I bought a blue one instead.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Instead.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Mm-hmm.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Okay.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
So in the place up.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yep.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
And our last word for language takeaway.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Interrupt.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Interrupt.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Interrupt.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Interrupt.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Interrupt.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
So when somebody interrupts you, they come in and...

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
They talk to you while you're doing something.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Or maybe while you're speaking.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Or maybe you're busy.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Uh-huh.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
People come in and bother you.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Okay.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
So interrupt.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Okay.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Some great words here in our dialogue.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And now we can listen to it again.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
This time it's going to be a little bit slower.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
And you'll be able to understand the language a little bit better.

05:08.000 --> 05:18.000
Um...

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Sorry to bother you.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Um...

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
My name is Rachel.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm new here.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Can I ask you for a favor?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Hi, Rachel.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Welcome on board.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Um, afraid I can't help you right now.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Excuse me.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
But can I bother you for a second?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
You know what?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I'd love to help you.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
But I'm about to meet an important client.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Do you want to try Sean instead?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
He sits right over there.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Sorry to interrupt you, Sean.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Could you do me a quick favor?

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Actually, I'm working on a document that is due in a couple of minutes.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I really can't talk to you right now.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Sorry about that.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Geez.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
I just want to know where the bathroom is.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
What's wrong with you people?

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
Okay, so there are some great ways that you can ask someone for a favor, right?

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah, we want to show you some really useful phrases for asking for help.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
So let's start with putting it together.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Put it together.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Let's listen to some different ways of how you can ask someone for a favor.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Example one.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
May I get you to do me a favor?

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
Can you call this package and you'll suit me?

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Example two.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Can I ask you a favor?

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Can you just finish this report for me?

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Example three.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Would you be a favor and post me that file?

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Okay, so those were great examples of asking for a favor.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
In our dialogue, we heard, can I ask you a favor?

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
But we could also say, can I get you to do me a favor?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Right, can I get you to do me a favor?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Also, I could say, will you do me a favor?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Will you do me a favor?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
So those are different ways of asking for a favor.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Let's say you want to ask someone for a favor, right?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
But they're busy, right?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
So you'll need some phrases to help you do this.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Exactly, you need some phrases to interrupt somebody, right?

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
So let's listen to some examples of what phrases you can use to begin to talk to someone.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, to interrupt them.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Okay.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
I hate to bother you, but I hate to bother you,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
but...

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I don't mean to bother you, but...

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I don't mean to bother you, but...

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Okay, so those are really nice and polite ways of beginning to talk to someone.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Exactly, they're really useful at the office.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
So maybe you want to talk to your boss, you knock on his door, kind of open it a little bit and say,

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you have time for a meeting today.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
Or you could say, I hate to bother you, but do you have time for a meeting today?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Exactly.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
So those are great ways of starting up a conversation.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
And maybe setting it up to ask for a favor, right?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
So we can combine them.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
I could say, I hate to bother you, but can you do me a favor?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Perfect.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Right?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah, really useful.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
And then you can ask someone for a favor.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Yep.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Okay, great stuff.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
So I guess we can listen to our dialogue again.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, let's listen to our dialogue for the third time.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And this time, I'm sure you'll understand it a lot better.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm sorry to bother you.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
My name is Rachel.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm new here.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Can I ask you for a favor?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Hi, Rachel.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Welcome on board.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I'm afraid I can't help you right now.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I'm getting ready for a very important meeting.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Excuse me, but can I bother you for a second?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
You know what?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I'd love to help you.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
But I'm about to meet an important client.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Do I ask Sean instead?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Please, it's right over there.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Sorry to interrupt you, Sean.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Could you do me a quick favor?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Actually, I'm working in a document that's doing a couple of minutes.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
I really can't talk right now.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Sorry about that.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Jeez.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I just want to know where the bathroom is.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
What's wrong with you, people?

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
All right, so now you have all the vocabulary necessary.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
The next time you need to ask someone for a favor.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yes.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
At the office with your friends, with your family, anyone.
