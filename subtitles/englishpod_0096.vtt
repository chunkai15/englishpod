00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.500
And I'm Erica.

00:07.500 --> 00:13.500
And today we are going back in time again, and this time we're going to be in the 1960s.

00:13.500 --> 00:22.500
That's right, we're going to learn some phrases and some slang that were really popular back in 1964.

00:22.500 --> 00:29.000
Exactly, and most of these phrases and words we still use today, so it's very interesting and very good to know.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
That's right.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
I'm looking forward to this trip back in time, so why don't we get started with the dialogue.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Hey man, I really like your pad.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
This is obviously a far out.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Thanks for wanting to crash here tonight.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
He's no problem, brother.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
I wanted to pad where people could come, listen to music and just hang loose.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
He's doing what I'm saying.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
I dig it man, we should go bash here to make it really happening seen.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah man, that would be groovy.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Hey, I got to split for a while.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Are you okay here by yourself?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Don't worry about me, brother.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
You could take care of your business.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Alright, peace out.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Alright, so great dialogue.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Very popular in the 60s, the music, the mood, and the words, right?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
That's right.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
So why don't we get down to business and look at the vocabulary that we saw in this dialogue

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
in language takeaway?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Language takeaway.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Well, the dialogue opened and we heard this guy say,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Hey man, I really like your pad.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I really like your pad.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Pad.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Okay, so pad, a very informal way of saying.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Your apartment.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Your apartment, right?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
And now it's, you can still use it today.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
We often hear the expression bachelor pad.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Okay, a bachelor pad.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
So that's an apartment where a single man lives.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Okay, so a bachelor pad.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Usually it's very nicely decorated and really a nice apartment, right?

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Or maybe it has empty pizza boxes all over the floor, my God.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Also a bachelor pad.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
But so that's what pad means in apartments.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yep.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
They were talking about the apartment and he said the lava lamps are far out.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Okay, it's far out.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
So that's really cool or amazing.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Right.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
And then lava lamps.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Those are those strange cone-looking lamps, right?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Kind of a light with some liquid moving movements.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Moving inside.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Very popular in the 60s.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, well, post some pictures of that.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
And the lamps are far out.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
So now you can use it with other things, right?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Like you are really far out.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, or this music is really far out.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
It kind of gives you the feeling like it's sort of spacey.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
It's spacey.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yep.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
All right.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So the pad is really far out.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
The lava lamps are great.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
And he was saying, thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
To crash.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
So to crash ahead of someone's place.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Right.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
So we're not talking about like a car crash.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, no, no.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
But so when you crash somewhere, what do you do?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Well, you are staying there.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Then you're going to stay there as a guest.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Right?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yep.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
And for free.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yes.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
So if, for example, you're going to New York and you're going to visit a friend,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
you might crash at your friend's house.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
That's right.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
So interesting word.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And it is quite commonly used now.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
So why don't we hear some examples of how we can use it?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Example one.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Hey, man.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Can I crash your place tonight?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Example two.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
I lost my keys.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
So I'm crashing on my girlfriend's house.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Example three.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
No.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
You've been sleeping on my couch for a month.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
You're not going to crash here tonight.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
All right.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Perfect.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
So to crash, right?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
It's still commonly used today.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Yep.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Now for the fourth word.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Groovy.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Groovy.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
That would be groovy.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
So again, this means like great or cool or really nice.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, this is, I think this is one of the main words of the 1960s.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Something was groovy.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes, I agree.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
So it kind of gives you the sense that it's sort of really cool, but in a relaxed way.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
It's groovy.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
This music is really groovy.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
That's right.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
And finally, his friend, he said, hey, I got a split for a while.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
To split.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Okay.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
So if I say, I have to split.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
You have to leave.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I have to leave.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yep.

04:42.000 --> 04:42.500
Very colloquial.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
And it means I have to leave for a little bit.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.500
Yep.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.500
Split for a while.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
That's right.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
You may not have heard this one before.

04:48.500 --> 04:53.500
So why don't we hear some examples to help you understand how it's used?

04:53.500 --> 04:56.500
Example one.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
Hurry up.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.500
We've got a split before the police get here.

05:01.500 --> 05:06.500
Example two.

05:06.500 --> 05:11.500
This party is boring.

05:11.500 --> 05:16.500
Let's split.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.500
Example three.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.500
I have to wake up early tomorrow, so we're going to split.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.500
Okay.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.500
Very good.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.500
So split.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.500
Now also, I think you can use it for relationships, right?

05:29.500 --> 05:30.500
Me and him.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.500
Me and her split up.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.500
That's right.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.500
So you ended your relationship.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.500
Yes, split.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.500
Okay.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.500
So we saw five really common phrases from the 1960s.

05:40.500 --> 05:44.500
Let's listen to the dialogue again a little bit slower.

05:44.500 --> 05:52.500
And then we'll come back and look at some phrases from the 60s.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.500
Hey, man.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.500
I really like your pad.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
Those lava lamps are far out.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.500
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.500
It's no problem, brother.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.500
I wanted a pad where people could come.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.500
Listen to music and just hang loose.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
You dig what I'm saying?

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
I dig it, man.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.500
We could throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.500
Yeah, man.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
That would be groovy.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.500
Hey, I got a split for a while.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.500
Are you okay here by yourself?

06:20.500 --> 06:22.500
Don't worry about me, brother.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.500
You go take care of your business.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
All right.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.500
Peace out.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.500
All right.

06:31.500 --> 06:36.500
Well, I want to get started at looking up these at 1960s slang phrases.

06:36.500 --> 06:40.500
So let's go now with putting it together.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.500
Put it together.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
All right.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
I'm putting it together today.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
Let's start with the first part.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.500
He talked about you dig what I'm saying.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
I dig it, man.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
You dig what I'm saying?

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
Two dig it.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.500
All right.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.500
So we know the verb dig which means to make a hole, right?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.500
Yeah.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.500
But now he's talking about understand.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.500
Yeah, basically you dig what I'm saying.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.500
Do you understand what I'm saying?

07:06.500 --> 07:09.500
And when he says I dig it, he says I understand.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.500
Yeah.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.500
Okay.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.500
Now there's also another meaning to this, right?

07:13.500 --> 07:14.500
Apart from understand.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.500
Yeah, it can also mean I like it.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
Okay.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.500
So I really dig this type of music.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.500
Or I really dig this restaurant.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.500
Okay.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
So it's kind of I like it.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
All right.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.500
Now moving on.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.500
He said we could throw a bash here.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.500
All right.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.500
Throw a bash.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
To throw a bash.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.500
So first of all, what is a bash?

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
A bash is a party.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.500
A really great party.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.500
An amazing party.

07:39.500 --> 07:43.500
Now I want to look at this verb to throw something.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.500
So we know that you throw a ball, right?

07:46.500 --> 07:47.500
Right.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.500
But how can you throw a party?

07:49.500 --> 07:53.500
Well, it's basically saying you organize or you host a party.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
And how can you use this phrase?

07:55.500 --> 07:56.500
Okay.

07:56.500 --> 08:01.500
So I can say last week I threw a birthday party in my house.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.500
Okay.

08:02.500 --> 08:06.500
Or let's throw a bash to celebrate your engagement.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.500
Okay.

08:07.500 --> 08:11.500
Or next week I'm going to throw a dinner party at my house.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
Okay.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
So to throw a party.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.500
And it's usually used for parties, right?

08:16.500 --> 08:17.500
Right.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.500
You wouldn't throw a meeting.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
All right.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
Okay.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.500
So now we heard them use the word man a lot, right?

08:25.500 --> 08:26.500
Hey, man.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.500
Yeah, that's right.

08:27.500 --> 08:34.500
Now this is so common even in modern English that I think we need some examples.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
Example one.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.500
Hey, man.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
Watch where you're going.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.500
Example two.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.500
Yeah, man.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.500
That's a great idea.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.500
Example three.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.500
Man, that was awesome.

08:51.500 --> 08:58.500
So man is one of those words that you just use at the end of your sentences or the beginning or the beginning or anywhere.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.500
And so you say, hey, man or yeah, man.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.500
Yeah.

09:02.500 --> 09:08.500
But what about, um, do you have to be a man to use it or do you have to be talking to a man to use it?

09:08.500 --> 09:11.500
No, not really men and women use the word man.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.500
Yeah.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.500
And you can call a girl like, hey, man, how are you?

09:15.500 --> 09:19.500
Yeah, but that sort of means that she's a really, really good friend.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.500
Like the same level of friend as your guy friend.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.500
Yeah.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.500
Yeah.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.500
Exactly.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.500
Okay.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.500
Very good.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
And now for the last phrase I'm putting it together.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.500
He said, you go take care of business.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.500
To take care of business.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.500
Okay.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.500
So I have to take a care of business.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.500
So we're not really talking about business and work here.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.500
No, no, no, no.

09:41.500 --> 09:46.500
So basically what we're saying is go handle your affairs.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.500
So do the things you have to do.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
Okay.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
So or solve your problems.

09:51.500 --> 09:55.500
So if I say, I have to go to city hall today and take care of some business.

09:55.500 --> 09:59.500
So you're maybe going to do something like pay my taxes or something like that.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.500
Yeah.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.500
Okay.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.500
So to take care of business.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
Okay.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
So we heard some great phrases.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
We saw these words.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
Let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.500
And then we'll come back and talk about this great decade.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.500
Hey, man.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.500
I really like your path.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.500
Those lava lamps are far out.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.500
Thanks for wanting to crash here tonight.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.500
There's no problem, brother.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.500
I wanted to pad where people could come.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
Listen to music and just hang loose.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
You take what I'm saying.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.500
I dig it, man.

10:31.500 --> 10:35.500
We should throw a bash here to make it really happen again.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.500
Yeah, man.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
That would be groovy.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.500
Hey, I got to split for a while.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
Are you okay here by yourself?

10:41.500 --> 10:43.500
Don't worry about me, brother.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.500
You go take care of your business.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
All right.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.500
Peace out.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.500
All right.

10:48.500 --> 10:58.500
So 1960's very famous among rock music, the piece and conflicts and all this stuff.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.500
Yeah, that's right.

10:59.500 --> 11:06.500
And I guess in English or Anglo pop culture, we look back at this decade.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.500
Very fondly.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.500
Yeah.

11:09.500 --> 11:13.500
And also, we really related to the hippie movement.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
Yeah, yeah.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
Long hair and baggy clothes.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
Yeah.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.500
You know, living in their cars going from concert to concert.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.500
Yeah.

11:20.500 --> 11:26.500
And I mean, speaking of music, I think if we think 1960's at least an in Anglo world, in the

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
Anglo world, we think of the best music.

11:28.500 --> 11:33.500
Like, I think this is the golden age of music in English speaking countries.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
Yes.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
It was a very good era.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
And well, what are you guys seeing?

11:36.500 --> 11:41.500
Do you think the 60's was the best decade or maybe you are more fond of the 70's, the

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
disco era?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
Or even the 90's.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.500
There's some pretty good music in 1994.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.500
Exactly.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
