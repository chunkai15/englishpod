Hello English learners. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco and I'm Erica and today

00:06.560 --> 00:12.320
We're bringing you the sequel of I'm sorry. I love you part two part two. That's right

00:12.320 --> 00:18.280
I guess a lot of our listeners enjoyed the first part and since it was such a romantic

00:18.280 --> 00:27.320
That I love it. Yeah, we're bringing part two so it's even more romantic and I'm sure everyone is gonna find some great and useful

00:27.320 --> 00:33.800
Language in it. That's right. We've got language that we used to talk about dates. A date. Yeah, so useful

00:33.800 --> 00:39.520
Language for when you're going on a date. That's right. Well before we look at this date language

00:39.520 --> 00:42.160
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time

00:47.720 --> 00:52.160
I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken. I feel just awful about this whole thing

00:52.160 --> 00:55.720
I want to make it up to you. Let me take you out to dinner tonight my treat

00:55.960 --> 00:58.200
Oh, that sounds great. I'd love to

00:58.920 --> 01:02.200
Here's my address pick me up a date perfect

01:15.520 --> 01:20.800
Thank you for such a lovely evening. The food was amazing and I had a great time me too

01:21.000 --> 01:25.080
You look so beautiful tonight. I wish this night would never end

01:25.880 --> 01:32.440
There's something that I have to tell you. But what is it? I woke up today thinking that this would be just like any other day

01:33.160 --> 01:35.160
And I was wrong

01:35.160 --> 01:40.520
To twist a fate brought us together. I crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy

01:40.520 --> 01:42.520
But I'm falling in love with you Veronica

01:56.600 --> 02:02.440
Wow such a romantic dialogue. It really sounds like they're falling in love

02:03.640 --> 02:08.920
Yeah, it's a really romantic thing that's going on right now, but there was some really useful words here

02:08.920 --> 02:11.480
So why don't we take a look at language takeaway?

02:13.480 --> 02:15.480
Language takeaway

02:15.720 --> 02:19.960
Today we have three words for language takeaway and the first one is

02:20.440 --> 02:22.440
Relieved relieved

02:22.680 --> 02:29.640
Relieved so we have some great examples on how we use relieved and I'm really sure you can understand the meaning from the sentences

02:30.680 --> 02:32.680
Example one

02:33.960 --> 02:36.920
They were relieved to hear that the company would not be making any layoffs

02:41.240 --> 02:43.240
Example two

02:45.320 --> 02:48.760
I'm so relieved to hear your voice. I was worried something happened to you

02:50.920 --> 02:52.200
I

02:52.200 --> 03:00.120
Guess relieved is like a happy or relaxed feeling that you get if you avoid something bad, right?

03:00.120 --> 03:07.080
Right. I'm so relieved that didn't happen. Yeah, now for our second word pick me up pick me up

03:07.720 --> 03:09.080
Pick me up

03:09.080 --> 03:11.080
So when you ask someone to pick you up

03:11.320 --> 03:15.640
You're saying basically come and get me. Okay, so let's let's give a couple of examples

03:16.600 --> 03:21.400
My husband was supposed to pick me up from work yesterday, but he forgot

03:22.520 --> 03:28.440
Does that really happen? Yes, all right, we'll have a talk with him or we could also say oh

03:28.440 --> 03:33.720
I need to hurry up the taxi will pick me up at seven. Yes, so come and get me

03:35.000 --> 03:38.600
And our final word in today's language takeaway is

03:39.400 --> 03:40.760
ordinary

03:40.840 --> 03:50.040
Ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary so ordinary is a normal word. Yes, meaning it's normal. Uh-huh

03:50.040 --> 03:56.040
Nothing uncommon about it. Yeah, so you can have like an ordinary person an ordinary day ordinary day

03:56.760 --> 03:59.720
Ordinary life. Uh-huh nothing exciting about it

04:00.840 --> 04:07.880
What else is ordinary ordinary podcast an ordinary podcast which English pot is not okay? Yeah, so ordinary

04:08.280 --> 04:14.280
Okay great words and I guess now we can listen to our dialogue a second time this time it'll be a little bit slower

04:14.360 --> 04:17.560
And this will help you to understand the language more clearly

04:25.400 --> 04:30.760
I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken. I feel just awful about this whole thing

04:31.640 --> 04:33.640
I want to make it up to you

04:33.640 --> 04:42.040
Let me take you out to dinner tonight my treat that sounds great. I'd love to here is my address

04:42.760 --> 04:44.760
Pick me up at eight

04:45.160 --> 04:46.520
Perfect

04:46.520 --> 04:52.520
Thank you for such a lovely evening the food was amazing and I had a great time

04:53.320 --> 04:59.560
Me too. You look so beautiful tonight. I wish this night would never end

05:00.440 --> 05:02.200
There's something I have to tell you

05:03.400 --> 05:10.280
What is it? I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day

05:11.000 --> 05:14.840
But I was wrong a twist of fate brought us together

05:15.880 --> 05:25.080
I crashed into your life and you into mine and this may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you Veronica

05:30.520 --> 05:37.320
Okay, so we looked at some great vocabulary and now we can look at some great phrases. So let's start with fluency builder

05:38.760 --> 05:40.760
Fluency builder

05:40.760 --> 05:46.040
on fluency builder today. We have three great phrases. So why don't we just start with the first one?

05:46.360 --> 05:53.400
Yeah, the first one we heard at the beginning of the dialogue make it up to you make it up to you make it up to you

05:53.960 --> 05:57.720
Okay, so we have some great examples on how we use make it up. So let's listen

05:59.640 --> 06:01.640
Example one

06:03.960 --> 06:07.240
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday. How can I make it up to you?

06:11.720 --> 06:13.720
Example two

06:17.000 --> 06:22.200
I feel terrible for calling your mother fat. I want to make it up to her. So I got her these flowers

06:22.680 --> 06:28.680
Example three

06:33.480 --> 06:37.000
John forgot my anniversary again. He's going to have to make it up to me

06:40.840 --> 06:45.400
We can see from the examples that when you use the phrase make it up to you

06:45.400 --> 06:51.400
You're kind of saying you want to balance something bad you did with some good action, right?

06:52.200 --> 06:59.960
So if you call your mother-in-law fat you better buy her at least some flowers or a card or something to make it up

06:59.960 --> 07:06.920
Yeah, yeah, so the bad action was calling her fat and the balancing good action was the flowers

07:06.920 --> 07:11.240
Yeah, I don't think flowers will be enough though. Hmm looks like a doomed marriage

07:12.600 --> 07:21.080
Okay, our second phrase my treat my treat my treat so we use this phrase when we want to say I'll invite you

07:21.080 --> 07:29.320
I'll pay for you. I'll pay. Uh-huh. Right, so I can say hey, let's go get some beers. It's my treat. Oh, thanks Marko

07:30.360 --> 07:38.840
So I'm paying, right? Yeah, my treat and our last phrase for fluency builder a twist of fate a twist of

07:39.720 --> 07:46.520
Fate twist of fate a twist of fate. So Erica, what is a twist of fate? A twist of fate is an

07:46.520 --> 07:55.560
unplanned event that has a big impact on your future or your life. Okay, Marko, can you give us an example of a twist of fate?

07:56.680 --> 08:03.400
All right, for example, okay, you're supposed to catch a flight to another country, all right, but you're late

08:03.400 --> 08:11.480
So you miss your flight, okay, and that flight crashes. Wow, right, so that's a twist of fate

08:12.440 --> 08:17.800
So yeah, it's like it's like fate. It's like destiny. Yeah, um, you were

08:18.520 --> 08:24.600
You weren't supposed to be on that flight. Okay, so a twist of fate. It's just a fate. Great on a happier note

08:25.040 --> 08:28.040
Let's listen to the dialogue a third time

08:28.120 --> 08:44.840
I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken. I feel just awful about this whole thing. I want to make it up to you

08:44.840 --> 08:49.400
Let me take you out to dinner tonight my treat. Oh, that sounds great. I'd love to

08:50.200 --> 08:53.320

09:11.240 --> 09:16.120
Me too. You look so beautiful tonight. I wish this night would never end

09:17.080 --> 09:23.560
There's something that I have to tell you. But what is it? I woke up today thinking that this would be just like any other day

09:24.440 --> 09:30.360
When I was wrong, the twist of fate brought us together. I crashed into your life and you into mine and

09:30.600 --> 09:33.800
This may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you Veronica

09:49.560 --> 09:52.840
Okay, so we're back Erica. I know you have a

09:53.560 --> 09:58.280
Story of a twist of fate in your life. Yes, recently actually this happened

09:58.840 --> 10:04.040
I went to this party and at the party there was a contest like sort of a lottery

10:04.840 --> 10:11.640
You could buy some tickets and win a prize and the prize was a week-long vacation. Okay, so I went with some friends of mine

10:12.360 --> 10:18.200
And they were tired. So they left early and they gave me their tickets and I guess what happened

10:18.520 --> 10:24.040
What happened? We won we won the week-long vacation. Wow. Yeah, it was amazing

10:24.040 --> 10:33.320
So that was a really lucky twist of fate. Yeah, that's a good story. Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't that good of a twist of fate for your friends

10:33.320 --> 10:37.800
Yeah, but they were very generous and let me have the prize anyway. All right

10:38.040 --> 10:42.600
Well, we want to hear your stories of maybe some type of twist of fate that you've had

10:42.600 --> 10:46.440
Yes, maybe love stories. Maybe tragic stories any story
