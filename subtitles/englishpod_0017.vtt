00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello English learners, and welcome back to another episode of EnglishPod My Name is Marco.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.000
And I'm Erica.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
And today with Erica, we are getting married.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Well, we're not getting married.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
We're not, but our actors in the podcast are.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
That's right. So we've got a lesson today about weddings.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
And you know what? A lot of the language in this lesson is about weddings and marriages.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
And maybe you don't need to use this language every day.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
But learning this vocabulary will definitely help you understand or learn a lot more about

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Anglo culture.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Okay, great point, Marco. I think now we can look at our vocabulary preview.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
The vocabulary preview.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
So two simple words in this vocabulary preview.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
The first one is groom groom groom groom.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
So who is the groom?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Is the man the man that's getting married.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Okay, and our second word is bride bride bride.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
And obviously the bride is the woman getting married.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Perfect. Now we have our bride and our groom.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
So it's time to listen to our dialogue the first time.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah, well, it's about time. You've been living with his parents for 40 years.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Don't be mean.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Look, here come the bride's mates. Oh, their dresses look beautiful.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Who are those kids walking in the aisle?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
That's the flower girl and the ring bear.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm pretty sure that they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, they look so cute.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I hope the food's good at the reception.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
That's all you ever think about.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Food. Oh, I think the bride's coming now. She looks gorgeous.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Wait, what's she doing? Where's she going?

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
So great. Does this mean the reception is canceled?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Oh, Markle that's so sad.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah, I know the reception is canceled.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Markle, we're not getting married.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Oh, well, I mean, the best part is when you go and eat and drink at the reception.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Okay. Well, there's some great language in this dialogue.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
And now let's look at our language takeaway.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Language takeaway.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Great. Our first word on the language takeaway today is it's about time.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
It's about time. It's about time.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
So now we are going to listen to some examples on how we use this great phrase.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Example one.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Dinner's ready.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
It's about time. I'm starving.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Example two.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Guess what? I finally got a job.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
It's about time. You've been unemployed for two years.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
Example three.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
We're almost there. Just a couple more minutes.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
It's about time. We've been driving for 12 hours.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
So this phrase means finally.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Finally, at last.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
We've been waiting a long time for this.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Exactly. Okay. So it's about time.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Great. Let's take a look at our second word now.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Ile.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Ile.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
A-I-S-L-E.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Ile.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
It's a tricky word. It sounds like the contraction of I will.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah, but it's spelled so strangely.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Right. We don't pronounce the S. The S is silent.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
It's true.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Ile.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
So what is an Ile?

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
In a big room where you have a lot of chairs that space in the middle that

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
allows people to walk through that's the Ile.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
So the Ile is the part where you walk in a big room.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
In a big room.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
With many chairs.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
With many chairs.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Okay. So in the church.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
The bride and groom walked on the Ile.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Exactly.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Let's move to a third word.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Bridesmaid.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Bridesmaid.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Bridesmaid.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
So who are the bridesmaids?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Or wait, maybe you should ask me that.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah, because we don't get bridesmaids.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
Okay. So the bridesmaids are the women who are friends of the bride who stand next

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
to her when she's getting married.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Usually they're her best friends.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Right. Okay.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay. So we have our bridesmaids.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Now we have our flower girl.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Flower girl.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Flower girl.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Again, I'll explain this one.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Please, please.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
The flower girl is that cute little girl who walks down the Ile

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
carrying the rings.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yep.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Okay. So a lot of useful vocabulary for a wedding ceremony.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
That's true.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Now let's look at our last word.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Gorgeous.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Goal.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Goal.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Goal.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Goal.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Goal.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Goal.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Goal.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Goal.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Goal.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Goal.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Goal.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Goal.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Goal.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Goal.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Goal.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Goal.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.600
Gorgeous.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.000
Gorgeous.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
gorgeous.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Beautiful.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Very beautiful.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah, you know, beautiful.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
You can only use with a woman.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Can you use gorgeous with a woman or with a man?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yes.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Gorgeous is a unisex.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
So both men and women are gorgeous.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Right.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You can say, oh, that girl is gorgeous.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
That guy is gorgeous.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Right.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Or you can say even this house is gorgeous.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Okay.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.120
men, women objects. Yes, yes. All right. Well, we've learned some really interesting vocabulary

06:16.120 --> 06:23.160
that will help us to understand an Anglo wedding. So why don't we listen to the dialogue slow down?

06:29.400 --> 06:37.400
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married. Yeah, well, it's about time. He's

06:37.640 --> 06:46.360
been living with his parents for 40 years. Don't be mean. Look, here come the bridesmaids.

06:46.360 --> 06:54.520
Their dresses look beautiful. Who are those kids walking down the aisle? That's the flower girl

06:54.520 --> 07:02.440
and the ring bear. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, they look so cute.

07:03.240 --> 07:10.600
I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception.

07:11.160 --> 07:19.560
That's all you ever think about. Food. Oh, I think the brides coming now. She looks gorgeous.

07:20.840 --> 07:29.960
Wait, what's she doing? Where's she going? Oh, great. Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

07:33.400 --> 07:40.840
Now in this dialogue, we have a word that many students often make mistakes on. So this is a word

07:40.840 --> 07:49.720
that causes a lot of problems. Yes, the word Mary. Mary. Mary, right? So we are going to listen

07:49.720 --> 07:58.280
now to some common mistakes on how English learners use this word. Right. So these are wrong examples.

07:59.160 --> 08:09.000
Example one. Honey, let's marry. Example two. We married four years ago.

08:10.360 --> 08:19.800
Example three. When I marry, I want a huge wedding. These are great examples of mistakes

08:19.800 --> 08:27.640
students make with the word Mary. They're missing a word. Let's listen to these right examples

08:27.640 --> 08:41.000
to see what word is missing. Example one. Honey, let's get married. Example two.

08:43.960 --> 08:49.960
We got married four years ago. Example three.

08:50.680 --> 08:55.560
When I get married, I want a huge wedding.

08:58.600 --> 09:05.880
Great. So we can see that when we use the word Mary, we say to get married. Exactly right.

09:05.880 --> 09:12.680
Get married. To get married, right? Okay. Don't forget that. Yes. Get married. I will get married.

09:12.680 --> 09:19.480
We got married. Right. So now you know exactly how to use this word. We are ready to listen to

09:19.480 --> 09:25.400
our dialogue again for the third time and this time it's going to be at a normal speed.

09:30.040 --> 09:34.280
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married. Yeah, well it's about time.

09:34.280 --> 09:40.040
You've been living with his parents for 40 years. Don't be mean. Look, here come the bride's

09:40.040 --> 09:45.240
mates. Oh, their dresses look beautiful. Who are those kids walking in the aisle? That's the flower

09:45.320 --> 09:51.320
girl and the ring bear. I'm pretty sure that they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, they look so cute.

09:51.320 --> 09:56.440
I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception.

09:56.440 --> 10:02.920
That's all you ever think about. Food. Oh, I think the bride's coming now. She looks gorgeous.

10:05.720 --> 10:11.720
Wait, what's she doing? Where's she going? So great. Does this mean the reception is canceled?

10:15.720 --> 10:21.000
Okay. Well, I'm going to be honest with you. I don't know too much about marriages because first of all

10:21.000 --> 10:28.200
I'm not married and I've never really been to many marriages. So Erica, some questions for you.

10:28.200 --> 10:32.200
Okay. What are these bridesmaids doing? What are they? What are they about?

10:32.200 --> 10:35.160
What are the bridesmaids doing? Yeah, what are they? What are they doing there?

10:35.160 --> 10:41.720
Well, like I said earlier, the bridesmaids are the friends of the bride. But the most important

10:41.800 --> 10:48.600
people besides the bride and groom are the best man and the maid of honor.

10:48.600 --> 10:55.640
Okay. And what do they do there in the ceremony? Well, what they do is they sign the marriage license.

10:55.640 --> 11:03.000
Okay. So they're like witnesses. Exactly. Okay. So, but wait a minute. They sign the marriage license

11:03.000 --> 11:07.400
there in the church. Yeah, of course, right inside the church. You sign the marriage license.

11:07.480 --> 11:12.840
Wow, that's strange because from what I know, in other countries, usually you will sign the

11:12.840 --> 11:19.480
marriage license before the ceremony. So you get married twice. Yeah, you have like the civil

11:19.480 --> 11:24.680
marriage and then you have like the church wedding or whatever. That's so complicated. Well, yeah,

11:24.680 --> 11:29.320
I mean the church wedding is just the ceremony. It's not really anything official.

11:29.320 --> 11:33.400
Oh, in Canada, it's the official part as well. I guess maybe you're just more efficient.

11:33.400 --> 11:39.480
Maybe. Well, this is a really fascinating or really interesting subject, isn't it?

11:39.480 --> 11:43.960
Yeah, because there's so many countries that have different marriage ceremonies. I know that marriage

11:43.960 --> 11:50.760
is in India last around seven days. Yeah. Yeah. I want to know more about how our users get married

11:50.760 --> 11:57.640
in their country. Yeah. So please go to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us how you get

11:57.720 --> 12:03.080
married in your countries. Yeah. I can't wait to hear your stories. Yeah, it should be interesting, right?

12:03.080 --> 12:08.520
Okay. Well, everyone, thanks for listening and until next time. Goodbye. Bye.
