00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Hello English learners, welcome back to another sports lesson with us here at English

00:07.400 --> 00:08.400
Pod.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.400
My name is Marco.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.400
And I'm Erica.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.480
And today we're going to be talking about a very interesting and very difficult game

00:14.480 --> 00:16.720
to play and it's golf.

00:16.720 --> 00:21.200
So we've got some golf vocabulary for you in this lesson.

00:21.200 --> 00:26.640
And I think we better actually look at a few vocabulary words in vocabulary preview before

00:26.640 --> 00:29.120
we start with the dialogue.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.640
Very vocabulary preview.

00:31.640 --> 00:38.280
On vocabulary preview today we have three words and the first one is a Fischinato.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.800
A Fischinato.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.800
And a Fischinato.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.280
A golf a Fischinato.

00:42.280 --> 00:47.800
Alright so this basically is a very fancy word of, there's a very fancy way of saying

00:47.800 --> 00:48.800
a fan.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.400
Yes, someone who likes something a lot.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.720
Okay so you are an a Fischinato.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.720
I like golf.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.360
Yeah, you can also be an a wine a Fischinato.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
Okay.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.840
So it's kind of like a hobby.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.840
You know a lot about it and you like it.

01:01.840 --> 01:05.360
And now our second word is not anywhere in the dialogue.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.000
No but we're going to use it when we explain some of these words so you need to know

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
it.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
The word is club.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Club.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
A golf club.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.280
Okay so a golf club is the tool you use to hit the golf ball.

01:19.280 --> 01:24.560
Right so it's a long tube basically that looks like a J kind of.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.920
Yeah so and you hit the ball with it.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.120
So that's a golf club.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.280
And now our third word is golf course.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.280
Golf course.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.280
A golf course.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.280
A course.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.480
So this is the area where you play golf.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.200
Yeah it's the like the golf field.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
Exactly.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.920
Yeah so it's a very big green area where you play golf.

01:44.920 --> 01:48.520
So those are the three words we have for vocabulary preview.

01:48.520 --> 01:54.480
So now we could listen to our dialogue for the first time as we listen to our sports

01:54.480 --> 02:06.000
announcers Rick Fields and Bob Copeland and see what happens on this occasion.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Good morning golf officials.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.480
My name is Rick Fields and you guessed it.

02:08.480 --> 02:11.120
I'm here with my main man Bob Copeland.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.480
Thank you Rick as you can see ladies and gentlemen.

02:13.480 --> 02:17.320
We are here in beautiful pebble beach with a top golf within the world of wine to win

02:17.320 --> 02:20.920
the grand prize of one million dollars.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.360
Whoa that's a lot of cash.

02:23.360 --> 02:30.360
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.280
All right we're here at the eight hall.

02:33.280 --> 02:39.080
It's a par fourth and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult

02:39.080 --> 02:40.080
to avoid.

02:40.080 --> 02:46.480
Although I did see Jack and Clouse hit a hole of one on this very same hole.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.880
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

02:50.880 --> 02:57.880
He was asking his caddy for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.800
Oh no not a good swing at all.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.600
It's definitely not his day today.

03:02.600 --> 03:06.200
On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.320
He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.680
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.880
He's having a hard time finding it and even his caddy is climbing to tree to try and

03:15.880 --> 03:16.880
spot it.

03:16.880 --> 03:17.880
Oh no.

03:17.880 --> 03:18.880
Run!

03:18.880 --> 03:19.880
Run!

03:19.880 --> 03:24.880
Somebody go, I don't control!

03:24.880 --> 03:31.240
So a pretty exciting ending to that dialogue there, a bear on the golf course.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.880
Yeah I wonder if Tiger is okay.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.640
I sure hope so because it would be a huge loss to the world of golf.

03:38.640 --> 03:44.400
Right so we did learn a lot about golf because they used some very specific and technical

03:44.400 --> 03:45.600
words for golf.

03:45.600 --> 03:50.240
So let's look at these now in language takeaway.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.520
Language takeaway.

03:51.520 --> 03:57.320
Alright so the announcers were talking about the game and they were talking about the course

03:57.320 --> 04:03.560
and they were here on the eighth hole and they said that last time Jack Nickelowski hit

04:03.560 --> 04:09.600
a hole in one hole in one hole in one hole in one hole in one hole in one hole in one.

04:09.600 --> 04:15.520
So this is when you hit the ball once and the ball goes in the hole.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.520
Exactly.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.520
So it's something very difficult to do.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.520
Yes.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.520
Right a hole in one.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.520
I've certainly never made one.

04:22.520 --> 04:28.520
Okay so sometimes it's also called an ace so it can be a hole in one or called an ace.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.520
Ah okay.

04:29.520 --> 04:34.900
Now for our second word now once we get to the hole to the ninth hole or the tenth

04:34.900 --> 04:39.520
hole we have to tee off to tee off.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.520
tee off.

04:40.520 --> 04:44.520
So when you tee off you begin playing.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.520
Right.

04:45.520 --> 04:50.640
So it's the very first instance where you put the little ball on the tee.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.520
And you hit the ball for the first time.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.520
Exactly.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.520
So to tee off.

04:54.520 --> 05:00.520
Now another golf vocabulary they were talking about a caddy.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.520
Right a caddy.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.520
A caddy.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.520
Now a caddy is a person.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.520
Yes.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.520
It's the person who carries your golf clubs.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.520
Exactly.

05:10.520 --> 05:11.520
So he carries your bag.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.520
Your golf clubs.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.520
And basically helps you while you're playing golf.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.520
Yeah he tells you which way you should hit the ball and maybe you know gives you a nice

05:19.520 --> 05:22.520
cool drink and looks after you.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
Very good.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.520
So that's a caddy.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.520
And now the caddy since he has to carry all the golf clubs.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.520
Tiger Woods asked him for his driver.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.520
A driver.

05:34.520 --> 05:35.520
Driver.

05:35.520 --> 05:36.520
A driver.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.520
Now a driver is a type of golf club.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.520
Right it's not a person.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.520
No no.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.520
It's a type of golf club.

05:42.520 --> 05:47.520
And it's a very big and heavy golf club that is used to tee off.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.520
So it's used to hit the ball a very long way.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.520
Yes.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.520
That is called the driver.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.520
Okay.

05:54.520 --> 06:00.520
So in the next thing they were talking about were some different types of scores that you could get

06:00.520 --> 06:01.520
on a hole.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.520
And the first one they mentioned was par.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.520
Okay.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.520
So you can make par.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.520
Or the par of the course can be four.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.520
Okay.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.520
Very good.

06:12.520 --> 06:19.520
So basically the par is the maximum number of swings or strokes you can make before putting

06:19.520 --> 06:21.520
the ball into the hole.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.520
Right.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.520
So it's like it's like the the right.

06:24.520 --> 06:29.520
So when the when the when a hole is par four you should only hit the ball four times.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.520
Four times or less.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.520
Yeah.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.520
Very good.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.520
Now if you don't make par.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.520
There are some options.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.520
You can make a bogey.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.520
All right.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.520
A bogey.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.520
Now sometimes the golf course is very difficult.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.520
Yeah.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.520
So instead of putting the ball in the hole.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.520
Let's say in four turns.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.520
Yeah.

06:49.520 --> 06:50.520
You do it in five.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.520
Okay.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.520
So it's one over par.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.520
One over par.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.520
So that's bad.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.520
Yeah.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.520
That's bad because you get a point.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.520
So it's kind of strange because in golf the more points you have.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.520
The worse you are.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.520
The worse you are.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.520
So that is a bogey.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.520
Now they also talked about a birdie.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.520
Birdie is the opposite.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.520
If you hit one under par.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.520
So that's good.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.520
Yeah.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.520
That's good because you have minus one one less than par.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.520
All right.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.520
So this is actually a lot of weird crazy strange language.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.520
Birdie, bogey, catty, driver.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.520
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to help us understand.

07:25.520 --> 07:33.520
Good morning golf officials.

07:33.520 --> 07:37.520
My name is Rick Fields and you guessed it.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.520
I'm here with my main man Bob Copeland.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
Thank you.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.520
Rick.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.520
As you can see ladies and gentlemen.

07:44.520 --> 07:49.520
We are here in beautiful pebble beach where the top golfers in the world are

07:49.520 --> 07:55.520
vying to win the grand prize of one million dollars.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.520
Whoa.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.520
That's a lot of cash.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.520
Let's go to the course and see how tiger woods is doing.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.520
All right.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.520
We're here at the eight hole.

08:04.520 --> 08:09.520
It's a par four and has some very difficult houses which many golfers find difficult to

08:09.520 --> 08:10.520
avoid.

08:10.520 --> 08:14.520
Although I did see Jack Nichlos hit a hole in one on this very same hole.

08:15.520 --> 08:21.520
Tiger Woods is about to tear off and let's see if he has the same look as Jack.

08:21.520 --> 08:27.520
Tiger is asking his catty for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.520
Oh no, not a good swing at all.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.520
It is definitely not his day today.

08:32.520 --> 08:37.520
On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.520
He'll definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.520
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.520
Deep in the trees.

08:45.520 --> 08:51.520
He is having a hard time finding it and even his catty has climbed the tree to try and spot

08:51.520 --> 08:52.520
it.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.520
Oh no!

08:53.520 --> 08:54.520
A bear!

08:54.520 --> 08:55.520
Run Tiger!

08:55.520 --> 08:56.520
Run!

08:56.520 --> 09:01.520
Somebody call Animal Control!

09:01.520 --> 09:02.520
All right.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.520
Great.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.520
So I think it's clear now what type of rules they have in golf and how it works.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.520
So why don't we take a look now at some of the phrases that we heard in the dialogue

09:10.520 --> 09:12.520
in Fluency Builder.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.520
Fluency Builder.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.520
Okay.

09:15.520 --> 09:20.520
Well, one of the phrases I want to talk about is something that Bob Copeland said.

09:20.520 --> 09:26.520
He said, as you can see ladies and gentlemen, we're here at beautiful pebble beach.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.520
Okay.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.520
As you can see.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.520
So this usually goes in the beginning of a sentence.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.520
Yeah.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.520
It's a way to say, I know you can see this.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.520
I'm telling you something you know.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.520
Okay.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.520
So maybe I'm showing you my house and I can say,

09:39.520 --> 09:42.520
as you can see, our living room is very spacious.

09:42.520 --> 09:43.520
Yes.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.520
So this is actually a really helpful phrase.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.520
It can help you sound really native like.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.520
So why don't we hear some examples of how it's used.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.520
Example one.

09:54.520 --> 09:59.520
As you can see, we recently remodeled our entire kitchen.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.520
Example two.

10:02.520 --> 10:08.520
As you can see here, the damage to the building is very serious.

10:08.520 --> 10:12.520
Example three.

10:12.520 --> 10:17.520
As you can see, the hair stylist made him steak when cutting my hair.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.520
All right, great.

10:18.520 --> 10:22.520
So as you can see, now for our second phrase,

10:22.520 --> 10:25.520
well, Tiger Woods wasn't doing very well.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.520
And the announcer said, it's not his day.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.520
It's not his day.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.520
It's not his day today.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.520
All right.

10:32.520 --> 10:37.520
So when it's not your day, you're having a bad time or a bad day.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.520
Right, maybe you're having difficulties or you're having bad luck that day.

10:42.520 --> 10:53.520
Yeah, so for example, today I had a headache and I ripped my pants and I spilled coffee on myself.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.520
So it really wasn't my day.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.520
Okay, it's not your day today.

10:57.520 --> 11:02.520
No, great phrase and also very common and it makes you sound very native.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.520
That's right.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.520
Now the last phrase, similar to it's not your day.

11:07.520 --> 11:11.520
We also heard that Tiger was having a hard time.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.520
Okay, to have a hard time.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.520
To have a hard time.

11:14.520 --> 11:19.520
Now if you have a hard time with something, you have difficulty with it.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.520
Okay, now it's not only related to golf, right?

11:23.520 --> 11:25.520
Of course, you can talk about anything like this.

11:25.520 --> 11:30.520
So I'm having a hard time understanding what this word means.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.520
Okay, or when I was in school, I had a hard time with math.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.520
All right.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.520
Me too.

11:36.520 --> 11:40.520
So to have a hard time means that you have difficulties with something.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.520
So great phrases, great words.

11:42.520 --> 11:48.520
And let's listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about golf.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.520
Good morning.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.520
My name is Rick Fields and you guessed it.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.520
I'm here with my main man, Bob Copeland.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.520
Thank you, Rick.

12:02.520 --> 12:07.520
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in beautiful pebble beach with a top golfer in the world.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.520
A vine to win the grand prize of one million dollars.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.520
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.520
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.520
All right.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.520
We're here at the eighth hall.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.520
We're here at the fourth hall.

12:25.520 --> 12:30.520
And it has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.

12:30.520 --> 12:34.520
Although I did see Jack Nicolaus hit a hole of one on this very same hole.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.520
Tiger Woods is about to tear off.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.520
And let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

12:41.520 --> 12:45.520
Tiger is asking his caddy for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.520
Oh, no, not a good swing at all.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.520
It's definitely not his day today.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.520
On the seventh hole, he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.520
He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.520
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep into the trees.

13:02.520 --> 13:07.520
He's having a hard time finding it and even his caddy has climbed a tree to try and spot it.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.520
Oh, no.

13:08.520 --> 13:09.520
I bet.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.520
Run, take a run.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.520
Somebody call that him control.

13:13.520 --> 13:26.520
All right, so Marco, I know that in the western business world, golf is actually super important for your career, isn't it?

13:26.520 --> 13:33.520
Well, many times, you know, when you see in movies or the stereotype is that business is done on a golf course.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.520
Yeah.

13:34.520 --> 13:39.520
And yeah, it is true many times, you know, people will invite you out to a golf course,

13:39.520 --> 13:44.520
and you'll be playing a game and, you know, talking business and relaxing at the same time.

13:44.520 --> 13:48.520
So maybe you negotiate a deal out on the golf course.

13:48.520 --> 13:53.520
Exactly. And of course, if you lose, it's a good thing because then the deal will pull through.

13:53.520 --> 14:00.520
Aha, okay. Well, actually, I know that is so important for people who are wanting to do well in business.

14:00.520 --> 14:07.520
And many people who don't speak English as their first language take golf English lessons.

14:07.520 --> 14:12.520
Right, so not only golf lessons, like how to play golf, but also in English.

14:12.520 --> 14:19.520
Like how to talk about golf, how to, you know, talk to other people and make deals while you're on the golf course.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.520
Mm-hmm.

14:20.520 --> 14:25.520
Yeah, because like in many other sports golf has also its slang and its terms and stuff.

14:25.520 --> 14:29.520
So yeah, it's very interesting and it's one of those cultural things.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.520
That's right.

14:30.520 --> 14:36.520
