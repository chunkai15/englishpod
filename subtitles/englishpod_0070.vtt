00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
And I'm Erica. And today we're bringing you a very, I would say embarrassing lesson for us men.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Right, embarrassing for men, but I think it's okay for women.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
That's right, we're going to be talking about buying underwear specifically women's underwear.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Right, so obviously not the favorite thing for men to do.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Well apart from being a little bit uncomfortable, it's also boring.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
It's all shopping, right?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
All shopping, so we're not really big on that.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
All right, but well, even though it might be a little bit of an uncomfortable topic,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
there is some great language in here, isn't there?

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah, there's some really good words, and of course the different types of underwear that

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
we're going to be looking at.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Yep.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
But we also have some words that we're going to take a look at before we get into our dialogue.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
So let's start with vocabulary preview.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Well, we're going to look at two words that will appear in our dialogue, and the first one is lingerie.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
lingerie.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
lingerie.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Okay, so lingerie, this is a nice fancy word, basically for underwear, right?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Right, for women's underwear.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Women's underwear.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
So lingerie, but it's very nice, very pretty.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Pretty sexy.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Yeah.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Now the spelling of this word is interesting, isn't it?

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, it spelled L-I-N-G-E-R-I-E.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
lingerie.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
lingerie.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yes.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Don't you love English feelings?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
So women's nice, pretty sexy underwear.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
That's right.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
And our second word, awkward.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Awkward.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Awkward.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
So this is a feeling that men have, especially when they're buying women's underwear.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Well, yeah, you feel a little bit uncomfortable, or it's a strange situation.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Weird, or out of place.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
It's awkward.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
All right, so we're going to be hearing both of these two words in the dialogue.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Now, Michael, where are we here?

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
We're going to be at a department store at the section where they have women's lingerie.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And we have a guy buying underwear for his girlfriend.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
All right.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, let's find out what happens.

02:06.000 --> 02:16.000
This sucks.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
What hate buying lingerie?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Okay, just find something and get out of here.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
All right, these are fine.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
No, no, don't come over here.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Don't come over here.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
You look a little lost.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Can I help you?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Um, I'm just having a look around.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm trying to find her something.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, you can't give her granny panties.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear?

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
We've got these lovely silky nighties, or how about some nice panties in a bra set?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Look, here's a nice set and push up bra.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
And you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Sure, that's fine.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
This is so awkward.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Well, what is my pick?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
What size is she?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, do you want to thong some bikini briefs?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Just pick something and get the hell out of here.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Um, I'll go with these, too.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
This is more defined.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
I just want to get this over with, and she better thank you for those.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Here you are, sir.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm sure she'll enjoy them.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Finally.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I'm sorry, sir.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I'm going to have to take them look inside your bag.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh, the poor guy.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I totally feel bad for him.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah, he was really nervous.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
And of course, it was very uncomfortable for him.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I know.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And then the security guard shows up.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Exactly.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
But we had the opportunity to take a look at some really great words and phrases.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
So let's start off with our first one in language takeaway.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Language takeaway.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
All right.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
We're going to look at words here that mostly have to do with underwear describing

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
underwear.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Right.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
And the first one is Granny panties.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Granny panties.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Granny panties.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
This isn't like a real real word, right?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
It's not something you'll find in a dictionary.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
No, it's a slang word.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
And we use it to describe really big ugly underwear.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Like your grandmother would wear.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
All right.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
So they're not like the sexy little underwear.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
They're more like long and it's not very appealing.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Just picture what your grandmother would wear.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
No.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
All right.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
So Granny panties.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
So obviously this guy doesn't want to be buying any of those.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
But the saleswoman suggests that he tries some sleepwear.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Sleepwear.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Sleepwear.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Sleepwear.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Okay.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
So sleepwear.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Obviously.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Close you wear when you're sleeping.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Now this is really interesting because men aren't really that complicated when it comes to sleeping.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Just throw on a t-shirt and that's it.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Well, obviously for women there are more options and more different things.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
You can choose from.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
The whole separate category.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Even when you're sleeping, you must wear something nice.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Yes.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
One type of sleepwear is silky 90s.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
90s.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
90s.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And I G-H-T-I-E-S.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Okay.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
So a 90.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
It's basically a dress that you wear when you sleep.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Okay.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Now the pronunciation is interesting because the first five letters are night.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Right.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Right.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
But you don't say night.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
You don't say 90.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
You say 90.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
You make the tea a D.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Now she offered him some silky 90s.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Right.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
So silky.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Obviously we know silky is a soft, shiny fabric.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Right.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
So when something is silky, it's either made from silky or soft and shiny.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Okay.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
So some silky 90s.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Very soft, shiny 90s.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Exactly.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Okay.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
What about our next word?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Well, the sales girl offers different styles of

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Andes.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Andes.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Andes.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Andes.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Andes.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
So Andes is an interesting word.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
It's basically short for underwear.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
underwear.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Okay.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
So you can just call underwear Andes.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yes.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
But I think you mostly use this when you're talking about women's underwear.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh really?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
I mean, I don't know if I would say Andes when I'm talking about men's underwear.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Now I don't think so.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Maybe children's underwear.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
For children, right?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yep.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Some of the different types of clothing.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
But now let's take a look at this interesting adjective.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Mortifying.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Mortifying.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Mortifying.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
This is mortifying.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Mortifying.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Okay.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
So when something is mortifying.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Well, I think we've got some examples to show you what that is like.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Example one.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
And then I fell in front of everyone.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
It was mortifying.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Example two.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
I was completely mortified when I realized what I had done.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Example three.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
It must have been mortifying for her when she realized that her underwear was showing.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So basically it's very embarrassing.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Super embarrassing.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I want to die almost.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yep.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Which is interesting.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I mean, mort.

07:19.000 --> 07:19.500
Right.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
Yeah.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.500
That's right.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.500
Yeah.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
Interesting.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.500
All right.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
Well, um, etymology here at England thought.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
All right.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.500
So some interesting.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.500
Okay.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
So we saw the different types of underwear.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.500
We saw this really great word for when you're really embarrassed.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.500
So now let's take a look at some of the phrases that you would use when you're really embarrassed in fluency builder.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
Fluency builder.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
All right.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.500
All right.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.500
We have two phrases to look at here.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
The first one.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.500
Get the hell out of here.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.500
Get the hell out of here.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.500
Get the hell out of here.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.500
Okay.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.500
So if I say, I want to get the hell out of here.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.500
You want to leave this place really quickly.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.500
Really quickly.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.500
Yes.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.500
I want to leave right now.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
Now when you're using this phrase or this sentence,

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
uh, get the hell out of here.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
Is it really polite?

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
No.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.500
Of course not.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.500
It's it's in polite.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.500
Okay.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
So it's really negative.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.500
Very negative and informal.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
Yeah.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
Yeah.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.500
So you would use this maybe with your friends or like in this case,

08:15.500 --> 08:16.500
think it to yourself.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.000
Yes.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
But it's not a good idea to use with your boss or your mother.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
All right.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Okay.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I guess sometimes depending on the tone you use,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
how you say it, you can sound really angry, right?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Definitely.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Right.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Okay.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
All right.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Well, let's listen to some examples.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Example one.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
This place is scary.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Let's get the hell out of here.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Example two.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
What are you doing in my house?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Get the hell out of here.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Example three.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
We're the friends party and all of a sudden no parents arrived.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
We got the hell out of there.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Quickly as possible.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
All right.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
So get the hell out of here.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Get the hell out of here.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Now let's take a look at our last phrase for a fluency builder.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Get this over with.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Get this over with.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I want to get this over with.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I want to get this over with.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
So you want to finish it really quickly.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
But you want to finish it because you're not really enjoying it, right?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Exactly.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
This is something that you use when the situation is negative.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
It's negative.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Okay.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
So I just want to get this over with.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I want to get this test over with.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I want to get this day over with.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
I want to get this.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Maybe if you're on a bad date.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I want to get this date over with.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Yes.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Exactly.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
All right.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
I think it would help us to hear them once more in context in the dialogue.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
This sucks.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
My hate buying lingerie.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Okay.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Just find something and get out of here.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
All right.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
These are fine.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
No.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Don't come over here.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Don't come over here.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
You look a little lost.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Can I help you?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Um.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I'm just having a look around.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm trying to find her something.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Well, you can't give her granny panties.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
We've got these lovely silky nighties.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Or how about some nice panties in a bra set?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Look.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Here's a nice set and push up bra.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Sure.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
That's fine.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
This is so awkward.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Well, what's the way to pick?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
What size is she?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, do you want to thong?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Some bikini briefs?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Maybe this nice pair of lazy boy shorts.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Just pick something and get the hell out of here.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Um.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I'll go with these too.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
This is more defined.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I just want to get this over with.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
And she better thank you for those.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Here you are, sir.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I'm sure she'll enjoy them.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Finally.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I'm sorry, sir.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I'm going to have to take them look inside your bag.

11:01.000 --> 11:09.000
Alright, so I guess the situation is very common.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
Men either having to shop for this type of article for their girlfriend or wife,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
because it's their birthday.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Or sometimes we get dragged into a store to buy this.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
So you're shopping with your girlfriend and she's going to make you go look it under

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
where with her.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
I usually don't do that though.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
I'll just go to the next section and just look around.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Look at tools.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Look at TVs and play stations.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yes.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
But you know what?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
I have seen some men who go shopping with their girlfriends or wives and actually enjoy buying

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
underwear.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
See, that's the thing.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
I think it makes sense, but I don't know how comfortable you would actually be.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
I don't know why.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
I guess just how it indicates sexuality and stuff.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I could do it for maybe five or ten minutes.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Give my professional advice and I'm out of there.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Alright.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Well, maybe those guys who look like they're enjoying themselves are just really talking

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
in their heads, telling themselves how much they hate this.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Exactly.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Maybe they're just pretending or listening to their iPod.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Well, tell us.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Well, guys.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
I know we've got a lot of male listener as tell us what you think.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Are you embarrassed by women's underwear?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Right.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Or women.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Why aren't you embarrassed when you buy men's underwear for your boyfriend or husband?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I think there's a lot to talk about here.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
So come to our website at EnglishPod.com.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
