Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.200
And I'm Erica.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.400
And today we're going to bring you a great lesson about calling the office.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.400
Yeah, that's right.

00:12.400 --> 00:18.080
So in this lesson, we're going to teach you some great words that you can use when you

00:18.080 --> 00:20.440
need to call your office to solve a problem.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.440
Right.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.720
So you are at home, you have a problem, maybe you can't go to the office.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.040
So you have to call them and tell them that you're not going to be able to go.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.040
Yes.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.040
Right.

00:30.040 --> 00:34.920
So we're not going to preview anything today because the dialogue is relatively easy.

00:34.920 --> 00:38.760
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look

00:38.760 --> 00:48.160
at some words.

00:48.160 --> 00:55.960
Hello hey, Daniel, that you can say, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a,

00:56.120 --> 00:59.520
I hate Louie J, I'm here, I may.

00:59.520 --> 01:03.520
Actually, I'm, early today.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.080
I love to say it.

01:04.080 --> 01:07.720
I'm already say it.

01:07.720 --> 01:14.880
I'm questioning it.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.360
MUSIC

01:18.360 --> 01:22.360
Early.

01:22.360 --> 01:28.680
Unirate, O's Nay, and I'm eating fay lightly, say, you're a shfay.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.680
I say, O's say, or yay, all in K and X say.

01:32.680 --> 01:38.360
S-y-a. I us way open, hey, U-t-a take off,

01:38.360 --> 01:40.680
hey, E-Koo-ri-ray.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.360
Okay, N-A, I tray, N-et-gay, I'm saying, S-t-ray.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.520
All right, so a pretty easy dialogue, right?

01:50.520 --> 01:53.800
Pretty simple. All right, so there are a couple of words that we want to look at,

01:53.800 --> 01:55.640
so let's start with language takeaway.

01:57.080 --> 02:02.200
Language takeaway. All right, well, today we're looking at three interesting words.

02:02.200 --> 02:07.000
The first one is U-flay, U-flay, U-flay, U-flay.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.160
Marco, what is the U-flay?

02:10.040 --> 02:14.120
All right, so when you have the U-flay, it means that you are sick, you have

02:15.160 --> 02:18.200
it's very similar to a cold. Right, but just worse, right?

02:18.280 --> 02:22.520
Worst, yeah, so when you have the U-flay, it'll keep you in bed for a while,

02:22.520 --> 02:28.600
for maybe a week or two. So you have a fever, your body is hurting.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.280
Yeah, yeah, you're just, you're really sick.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.400
Yeah, you're really sick. Okay, so U-flay.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.240
All right, well, what about our next word?

02:35.240 --> 02:39.240
Well, actually, the next word is phrase that you can use when you're calling the office,

02:39.240 --> 02:43.320
I'll in K in X-a. All in K in X-a.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.200
All in K in X-a. Okay, this is a really useful phrase,

02:48.200 --> 02:53.720
and I think it would help us to hear some examples of what it sounds like, so we can understand the meaning.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.400
Example one.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.040
Or if I people pay all K in X-a, U-flay.

03:02.040 --> 03:02.680
Example two.

03:05.480 --> 03:11.000
If U-a, all K in X-a, on one or May, I'm Tay, or yay, Iard Fay.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.440
Example three.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.240
I'm out in the Ealing Fay all the way.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.400
Oh, say, I'm all in K in X-a.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.080
So with this phrase, you're basically saying that you are not going to the office.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.040
Exactly.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.400
So let's take a look at our last word for language takeaway.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.400
E-cover, Ray.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.520
E-cover, Ray.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.480
E-cover, Ray.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.200
E-cover, Ray.

03:36.920 --> 03:42.280
Okay, so it's a pretty simple word. E-cover, Ray means to get better,

03:42.360 --> 03:44.200
to start feeling healthy again.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.920
Okay, so kind of to recharge your batteries.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.440
Exactly, so this is a great verb to use when you want to say,

03:50.440 --> 03:52.200
I'm going to feel better.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.360
Okay, E-cover, Ray.

03:54.360 --> 03:58.200
So some really great words, some really interesting phrases.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.400
So let's listen to this dialogue again, and then we'll come back.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.320
Hello, hey, and you're the Eaking Spay.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.560
How hey, M-A-I-L-P-E-A.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.360
I hate you, E-R-D.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.720
E-R-E-R-H.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.240
I hate U-I-J.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.040
How are U-I-A?

04:19.080 --> 04:23.240
Actually, I'm E-Link Fay, I quite eluted, day.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.080
I'm already say U-T-E-R-H-A, at the.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.120
I was hungry.

04:28.920 --> 04:35.160
I think I'm, I mean, K on day is to put to luve.

04:35.160 --> 04:47.160
I am a headache, or say, hot day, honey rain, rosemary, and I'm eating fay lightly, say,

04:47.160 --> 04:56.160

05:03.160 --> 05:11.160
All right, Michael, have you ever found yourself in a situation like this?

05:11.160 --> 05:16.160
Well, yeah, a couple of times that I haven't been able to really make it to the office,

05:16.160 --> 05:20.160
and I've had to call. So yeah, I would have to call and tell them that I'm not going to make it,

05:20.160 --> 05:22.160
or maybe then I'm going to be a little bit late.

05:22.160 --> 05:27.160
