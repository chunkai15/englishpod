00:00.000 --> 00:07.840
Hello everyone and welcome back to another lesson here at English Pod, my name is Marco

00:07.840 --> 00:12.720
and my name is Katherine and today, Marco, you and I are talking about movies, right?

00:12.720 --> 00:17.280
We're talking a little bit about movies but mostly we're having a big argument.

00:17.280 --> 00:22.320
Okay, I kind of like arguments. Lots of great words and phrases for you to learn here in English

00:22.320 --> 00:27.600
but we've got an upper intermediate level lesson with some people who are not getting along very well

00:28.080 --> 00:32.240
It's a couple, a guy in a girl and they're having a fight as couples do

00:32.240 --> 00:36.880
so we're going to be learning a lot of the different language that they are using in this very heated debate

00:37.680 --> 00:41.440
so let's listen to this dialogue for the first time and then we'll be right back.

00:48.720 --> 00:54.480
Wow, the terrible movie is finally over. Next time I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing

00:55.440 --> 01:01.440
Well, you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything. Not everything, just this film

01:01.840 --> 01:08.720
Even the title is ridiculous and it's so long. Those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life

01:09.360 --> 01:15.280
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back. I'm thinking of taking you back home

01:15.840 --> 01:18.640
I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative

01:19.360 --> 01:24.960
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage

01:25.200 --> 01:30.080
You see that's what I'm talking about. I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.

01:30.080 --> 01:35.440
Next time go with your gay friend who's more in touch with his feelings. Well, he's more of a man than you are

01:35.680 --> 01:42.880
At least he appreciates love stories. Love stories more like one night stands. Don't criticize Mario

01:42.960 --> 01:48.080
Or else I'll start on those fat drunk friends of yours. There are no scenes my friends fat

01:48.480 --> 01:54.240
What about those whales you call friends? You're unbearable. You can walk home. I'm leaving. Bye

02:05.440 --> 02:10.000
I think the guy was exaggerating a little bit. What do you think? I think they were both exaggerating

02:10.080 --> 02:14.640
You know by the end of an argument. Both people are saying things that maybe they don't mean

02:15.360 --> 02:17.360
I think we'll talk a little bit more about this

02:17.360 --> 02:21.040
Towards the end of the show, but now why don't we take a look at language takeaway?

02:22.640 --> 02:23.920
Language takeaway

02:25.040 --> 02:32.080
All right on language takeaway today. We have four words and the first one that you probably saw in the very first sentence is a chick flick

02:32.640 --> 02:39.120
Chick flick. So first of all the word chick means a woman. It's slang and it's not very nice. It's not very nice

02:40.080 --> 02:46.560
I mean between guys you would use it. It's like all this chick or that chick, but you wouldn't really walk up to a girl and call her a chick

02:46.560 --> 02:51.520
Right now you wouldn't say hey chick what's up? That's that's not something you want to say so

02:51.680 --> 02:56.720
Chick is a as a slang word for a girl or a woman and that chick flick is a girl's movie

02:57.040 --> 03:03.760
So a flick is a movie another slang word exactly. So this is the slang phrase for flick. So hey

03:03.760 --> 03:05.760
Marka what flicks are showing at the movie theater?

03:06.480 --> 03:12.960
All right. Yeah, so movies. So in the chick flick is usually a romantic movie a drama something that's very

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Like beaches

03:16.000 --> 03:19.200
beaches is a chick flick. I don't know if they were seen that. I've never seen it. Also

03:19.600 --> 03:24.720
He's just not that into you is one of those new chick flick or like how to lose a guy in 10 days

03:25.120 --> 03:30.640
Yeah, how to lose a guy in 10 days or the devil wears Prada bride wars bride wars wow

03:30.720 --> 03:35.280
Lots of chick. I've actually never seen any one of these except how to lose a guy in 10 days

03:35.280 --> 03:40.320
I've actually only seen that one. All right, so chick flick is a girl's a girl's a girl's woman's movie

03:41.040 --> 03:43.760
And next up we have a word is sarcastic

03:44.000 --> 03:49.120
What's sarcastic jokes? So sarcastic jokes or somebody being sarcastic

03:49.120 --> 03:52.640
Marka you're always so sarcastic. So what would sarcasm sound like?

03:54.640 --> 03:56.640
Yeah, he's really funny

03:57.600 --> 04:01.680
All right, so it's not really what you're saying. It's kind of how you're saying it

04:02.400 --> 04:07.520
Right, so it's kind of like by saying he's really funny you're saying yeah. He's a funny guy

04:07.520 --> 04:10.160
But if I say oh he's really funny

04:10.800 --> 04:13.760
I'm saying he's not funny. He's these being mean

04:13.760 --> 04:21.600
Yeah, he's a jerk. He's a jerk. sarcasm is kind of one of those things that it's a little bit difficult to learn how to do or to actually get it right

04:22.240 --> 04:25.600
Especially in English, right? Yeah Marco great explanation

04:26.560 --> 04:33.520
Exactly, that's the way it goes. Oh, yeah, you're so funny. Oh, you're amazing. You should go to you went to sarcasm school

04:34.080 --> 04:36.080
So my parents would be really mean

04:37.680 --> 04:44.400
Sorry, you're just kidding. All right, so apart from being sarcastic you can criticize someone like you're ever critical

04:45.760 --> 04:52.640
All right, sorry, I'll stop you really is the character right now. All right, so critical to criticize someone is to

04:53.440 --> 04:59.600
To complain about them or to say that the things that they do are not very good so you can criticize a person or a movie

05:00.160 --> 05:05.600
Yeah, so this movie wasn't very good. It wasn't funny the actors were bad. It was really long

05:06.000 --> 05:10.800
These are criticisms criticism. All right, well, and then moving on the girl was finally

05:11.280 --> 05:15.440
Tired of the guy and his complaints and she said he's unbearable

05:16.000 --> 05:19.840
Gosh, you're unbearable, so the root of this word is to be able to

05:20.320 --> 05:24.000
Like to stand something to bear it and so if you're unbearable

05:24.800 --> 05:30.160
Something is unbearable. You just can't stand it. All right, so you're tired of it. You can't stand it

05:30.240 --> 05:36.000
She's she thinks he's so unbearable. She makes him get out of the car and she leaves. Yeah, she said you can walk home

05:37.040 --> 05:44.960
All right, so that's an unbearable person, right? Mm-hmm. Okay, so we took a look at those four main words here in order

05:45.040 --> 05:50.000
Dialog let's move on now to some of the phrases that we found in fluency builder

05:51.440 --> 05:53.440
Fluency builder

05:53.440 --> 06:00.000
This first one's a common one especially when we talk about women and men and the relationship between women and men

06:00.000 --> 06:03.520
We say about men that maybe they should be more in touch with

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Their feelings or their feminine side

06:07.120 --> 06:12.160
Yeah, okay, so if you're saying to be more in touch with your feminine side

06:12.240 --> 06:13.840
What exactly are you saying?

06:13.840 --> 06:18.880
So the question well what you're saying is that you want to be able to express your feelings more

06:18.880 --> 06:25.120
Or you want to be able to understand more about your your feminine side or something like this

06:25.120 --> 06:30.080
So to be in touch with is is more about yourself. It's about self reflection and self

06:30.480 --> 06:36.080
Understanding so so you could say I'm a very serious person, but I want to make some changes in my life

06:36.080 --> 06:39.040
So I'm trying to be more in touch with my inner child

06:39.120 --> 06:41.120
Your inner child

06:41.440 --> 06:46.640
All right, so to be in touch with and it's usually related to feelings to something

06:46.880 --> 06:54.720
Intangible to behavior yeah, to behavior all right moving on now a heated a phrase a one night stand

06:54.960 --> 07:02.080
Oh, I'll let you explain this one Marko. All right, so a one night stand is a casual and very quick temporal

07:03.360 --> 07:08.320
Encounter that's usually sexual encounter. It's romantic right so it can be between

07:09.200 --> 07:11.760
Two different people they meet each other one night

07:12.720 --> 07:17.040
They have a relationship for one night only and then they never see each other again

07:17.040 --> 07:20.400
So it's a it's casual it's casual very good

07:20.400 --> 07:24.720
So yeah, you would see this you see this a lot in shows like you know sex in the city

07:24.720 --> 07:26.240
You know, yeah, there's a lot of

07:26.240 --> 07:32.240
One night stands in that show all right, so a one night stand and well related to this

07:32.640 --> 07:36.720
The girl was criticizing his friends and she said they're no saints

07:37.360 --> 07:42.800
Okay, so you could say this many different ways. He's no saint. She's no saint or I'm no saint

07:42.800 --> 07:50.080
You're no saint so a saint is a good person. It's a word that we use in religion to say someone who's like mother Teresa or

07:50.640 --> 07:55.280
Someone who's just really good and kind and doesn't commit any sins exactly and so to say

07:55.280 --> 08:02.400
I'm no saint is to say well I do bad things or I say bad things. I'm not perfect. Okay, so he or they they're no saints

08:02.560 --> 08:07.840
They do bad stuff, too. Yeah, very good. So that's the way that you would use he's no saints. They're no saints

08:08.560 --> 08:13.200
All right, so I think now we should listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back

08:21.520 --> 08:27.840
Wow the terrible movie is finally over next time. I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick

08:28.560 --> 08:31.840
Well, you should have picked in the end you always complain about everything

08:32.400 --> 08:38.000
Not everything just this film even the title was ridiculous and it's so long

08:38.480 --> 08:41.600
Those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life

08:42.240 --> 08:45.600
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back

08:46.320 --> 08:51.520
I'm thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative

08:52.240 --> 08:57.680
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage

08:58.080 --> 09:06.160
You see that's what I'm talking about. I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore next time go with your gay friend who's more in touch with his feelings

09:06.560 --> 09:13.520
Well, he's more of a man than you are at least he appreciates love stories love stories more like one night stands

09:14.000 --> 09:20.880
Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat drunk friends of yours there no saints my friends fat

09:21.360 --> 09:27.120
What about those whales you call friends? You're unbearable you can walk home. I'm leaving fine

09:28.640 --> 09:30.640
You

09:40.800 --> 09:41.840
All right, so

09:41.840 --> 09:48.080
Katherine is this an argument that you would say is a typical among couples or maybe people that are probably about to break up right?

09:49.120 --> 09:53.600
Not couples that are happy. I would say but yeah, you definitely have people who are

09:53.920 --> 09:57.600
Well, I guess it's kind of the battle of the sexes, right? You have people who

09:58.640 --> 10:03.120
Are different genders and so they don't always understand each other. You know you want to have your girlfriends as a girl

10:03.120 --> 10:06.960
And your girlfriends behave and talk in a certain way together and guys do the same thing

10:07.200 --> 10:10.720
But with their friends and so sometimes you have these clashes these

10:11.200 --> 10:15.360
Interactions that are negative and you know when people are upset with each other they say mean things

10:15.920 --> 10:19.280
And especially I think in this case, they don't really like each other's friends

10:19.920 --> 10:28.960
Exactly, and that's a kind of a of a common thing like a guy doesn't like his his girlfriend's friends because maybe they gossip too much or something like that

10:28.960 --> 10:32.800
And the same thing with the girl right because a guy's friends maybe drink too much

10:32.800 --> 10:34.800
She played so many car games

10:36.080 --> 10:41.600
So I think a lot of times these these problems also have to do with the fact that like when a girl is with her girlfriend

10:41.600 --> 10:45.520
She maybe acts differently or with when a guy's with his guy friends and so that's weird

10:45.920 --> 10:50.880
Sometimes for the relationship because you see your your partner acting differently with other people right

10:51.200 --> 10:56.640
Do you like your boyfriend or girlfriend friends? Do you get in fights about this kind of stuff or you know what the in laws?

10:57.280 --> 10:59.040
Oh, that's the whole

10:59.040 --> 11:01.040
No, that's the whole

11:02.160 --> 11:06.720
