00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Hello English learners, welcome back to English pod, my name is Marko.

00:05.800 --> 00:11.700
And I'm Erica, and today we're going to be bringing you the second part of our job interview series.

00:11.700 --> 00:18.000
That's right, so this is an advanced lesson, and we're going to be talking about educational background and experience.

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
Right, so in the first part we saw preparing for a job interview, now we are at the job interview and we're just going to be talking about your

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
educational background and your job experience.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
That's right, and the language we're going to learn is going to focus mostly on these two areas.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Okay, perfect.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
So let's take a look at some of the difficult words before we listen to the dialogue in vocabulary preview.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Alright, so we're going to talk about a few common words that have to do with education.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Now the first word, I think we might know this one, but there's a little trick to it.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
So the first one is major major major.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
So yeah, I guess everyone knows what a major is, right?

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, it's the main subject that you study in university.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Right, so you can study business as a major or

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
History.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Exactly.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yeah.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
So but you can also use it as a verb, right?

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
That's right, I majored in history.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
So usually it's followed by the preposition in.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yes, always.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
In fact, when used as a verb, I majored in science.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I majored in business.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yes.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
Okay, so you can say my major is business administration or history or you can say I majored in business.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah, and the same pattern applies to minor.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay, so minor.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
This is really interesting because this is more common in English speaking countries, right?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
That's right.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
So what exactly is a minor?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Well, just like your major, but smaller.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Okay.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
So if you major in history, maybe 60% of your classes are in history and you minor in French,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
maybe 30 or 40% of your classes are in French.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
So basically you can have two subjects in your degree.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
You can have a major in business with a minor in art.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Yes.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Okay, that's interesting.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
All right, and another two simple words, a bachelor's degree.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
A bachelor's degree is what you get after going to university for four years.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
So a bachelor's degree after four years, you get that.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah, after that, you get a master's degree.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Right.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
So that's another two years after your bachelor's degree.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay, and I guess a master's is more focused on an area, right?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yes.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
More specialized.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
More specialized.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
And then the highest degree you can get is a PhD.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Exactly.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
The philosophy doctorate, right?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Uh-huh.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
But you're not actually getting a degree of philosophy.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
No, it could be in international relations.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Okay.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
But this is really hard to get.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
You have to go to school for another five or six years, right?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And it's a lot of research and not many people have it.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Anyway, some simple words, but you know what?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
It's quite unique to the English speaking world, the system.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
So we thought we'd bring it to you.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Now.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Right.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Perfect.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
So this guy who is at an interview and he's going to be talking about his education

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
and work experience.

03:27.000 --> 03:36.000
Thanks for coming in today.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Did you have any trouble finding us?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Please.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Take a seat.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Thank you.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Cool.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Let's get started.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Tell me a bit about your educational background.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Sure.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterson University with a major in business administration,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
with a specialization in information management.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And I'm honored in psychology.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I chose this course of study for two reasons.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
I wanted to gain some practical marketable skills, which the information management

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
track divided.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
And I also feel that the interpersonal skills are essential for professional success.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Hence the minor in psychology.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Interesting.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Are you a postgraduate studies?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
So I pursued a master's in that area.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I also strive to keep my professional skills current.

04:20.000 --> 04:29.000
So I continuously attend seminars and conferences related to management and customer service.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Very good.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
in both client care and process management.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
to achieve better customer satisfaction.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Interesting.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yes.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
In this position, I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
of the company.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our turn rate to about 5%

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
which had a direct impact on revenue.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Well, those were some pretty good answers to those questions.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
But I don't know, Marco.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
There was a little awkward moment.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I don't know if you guys heard it.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Natural body.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
What's a function?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Functions.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Well, making the interview a little bit more interesting, right?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
It doesn't have to be boring.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Exactly.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
But what is really interesting is some of the language he used to describe his educational background

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
and work experience.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
So let's look at that now in language takeaway.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Okay.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
So in language takeaway today, we have seven words that we want to focus on.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Before we give you some tips about doing well on a job interview.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
So let's take a look at the first word.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Course of study.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Course of study.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Course of study.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
A course of study.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
So what is a course of study exactly?

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Basically, it's like a plan of study or a path of study.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Okay.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
So his course of study was business administration.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Exactly.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
So that is his course of study.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Now let's take a look at our second word.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Track.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Track.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Track.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Track.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
So he said he wanted to gain some practical,

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
Markable skills that the information management track provided.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Exactly.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
So what does he mean by this track?

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Again, basically, if the track of study is like the path of study.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Okay.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
So the direction of your study.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Okay.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
So I guess it would be like think of a train and the train tracks, right?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Exactly.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Where the train travels.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
So that's where it's taking you.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
That's the path that he followed or you should follow or you want to follow.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yes.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Okay.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
That's pretty interesting.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Now let's take a look at our third word.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
And it's a really nice conjunction.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Hence.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Hence.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Hence.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Hence.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Hence.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
So it sounds fancy.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
But.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
What is it?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
So.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
So.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Right.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
So you can use it as a conjunction between two ideas.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
So he said, what would be an example of how you could use hence.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You could say the economy is doing poorly.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Hence.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
People are losing their jobs.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Okay.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Hence.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
So therefore in consequence.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
So.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Exactly.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
But it just sounds a lot more like professional and formal.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Okay.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
So try and use this conjunction hence.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Right.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Instead of saying so, therefore.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Yep.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Use it.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Okay.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Our fourth word.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Pursued.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Pursued.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
He pursued a master's.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Okay.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
So to pursue.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
To chase after something.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
To chase after.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
So you can pursue a master's degree like he did.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Yes.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
You can pursue a promotion.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
A dream.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Mm.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Nice one.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Can you pursue a girl?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yes.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
You can.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Right.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Okay.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Now let's look at our next word.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Strive.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Another great word.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
You can use and talking about your experience.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
To strive is to try really hard.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
To try really hard.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Okay.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
So I know we have some examples for strive.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Let's take a listen.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Example one.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
At our company.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
We are always striving to improve our services.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Example two.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
He really strived to get a new job and his work paid off.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Okay.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Great examples of strive to fight to try really hard.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
All right.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Okay.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Now the next word.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I didn't really know what it meant.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
So this is really interesting.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Bread.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Bread.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So it's kind of like saying bread.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
But adding a TH at the end.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Yeah.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Bread.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Bread of experience.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Okay.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
So this basically means it's wide.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Exactly.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
So when you have a great breadth of experience, you have a wide variety of experience.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Okay.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So maybe in different fields or in different jobs.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
You can have experience like in marketing and in a little bit in finance and a little bit

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
in management.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Yes.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
A breadth of experience.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
All right.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
All right.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And now for the last word, it's actually three and one.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
A three and one deal.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
A three and one deal.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
That actually that they are very related.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Okay.

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
When he talked about his work experience, he was saying he supervised and coordinated the customer

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
support team.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Okay.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So he watched over.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Right.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
And made things work together well.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
To coordinate.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yes.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
So these are really great verbs that you can use when you're talking about your job responsibilities.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yes.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
I supervised.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I coordinated.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Mm-hmm.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
And he was another really great one to say to implement.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
To make something happen to put it in place.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Right.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
So he implemented new strategies.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Implemented new policies.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Okay.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
To set in action.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Exactly.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
All right.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
So a lot of great vocabulary, a lot of great stuff.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
And well, you can use it for when you are at a job interview.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Mm-hmm.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
So let's listen to this dialogue again.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
And when we come back, we're going to give you some tips.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
So you'll do well in this part of the job interview.

10:26.000 --> 10:38.000
Thanks for coming in today.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Did you have any trouble finding us?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Please.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Take a seat.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Thank you.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Well, let's get started.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Tell me a bit about your educational background.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Sure.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterson University with a major in business administration.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
With a specialization in information management.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And I'm honored in psychology.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I chose this course of study for two reasons.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
I wanted to gain some practical marketable skills which the information management

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
track provided.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
And I also feel that the interpersonal skills are essential for professional success.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Hence the minor in psychology.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Interesting.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Are you a postgraduate studies?

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
So I pursued a master's in that area.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I also strive to keep my professional skills current.

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
So I continuously attend seminars and conferences related to management and customer service.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Very good.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
in both client care and process management.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
to achieve better customer satisfaction.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Interesting.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yes.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
In this position, I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
of the company.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our turn rate to about five percent,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
which had a direct impact on revenue.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
All right. Well, I want to talk about two main things.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
And the first thing I want to talk about is how you address this question about your educational background.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Like, what is the interviewer looking to find out?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Okay, perfect.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
So when you are talking about your educational background,

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
you shouldn't only talk about your college degree, right?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Yep.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
You should also talk about any type of training that you've had.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Yeah, I think it's really important to let the interviewer know that you're continually trying to update your skills

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
and improve your knowledge.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
So any sort of courses or seminars that you might attend, this is a great chance to highlight those.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And that's what the interviewer is looking for.

12:55.000 --> 13:04.000
Also, any trade publications and magazines that you read related to your job is a great way to sort of highlight your desire to keep learning.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Well, I think that's really important because it's good that you went to a good university.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
You got this degree and everything, but continuously training yourself.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
Maybe just by listening to business podcasts or reading specific magazines or stuff like that.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
That is demonstrating that you care about what you do and that you are continuously learning, right?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Exactly.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
Okay, so those are the main things to talk about in your educational background.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
Now, when this work experience question pops up, what should you really say?

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
When you're answering this question, I think there's something really important to keep in mind.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
What's that?

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
You want to make sure that you're being as specific as possible, right?

13:45.000 --> 13:55.000
So giving examples of what you've done, like really specifically what you did, all of the sort of the main achievements you have.

13:55.000 --> 14:06.000
Okay, so like for example, we saw in our dialogue that he talked about specific strategies that he implemented to improve customer support in that company.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
And he gave some numbers.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Right, he said, yeah, he lowered the turn rate to about 5%.

14:11.000 --> 14:20.000
So it's so important whenever you can attach a number to your success or your achievement to be able to do that in the interview.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I'm really, really demonstrate your achievement.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Mm-hmm.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah, I think that's really important.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
And another thing when you're talking about previous jobs is make sure you keep it on a positive.

14:33.000 --> 14:42.000
Even if your experience was not very good or you didn't like the company or you had problems, you should avoid talking about that and always keep it on a positive note.

14:42.000 --> 14:52.000
Right, so if the interview asks you why you want to join this company, why you're looking to leave your current job, you want to give these positive reasons.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
Right, you don't want to say, well, because my boss was a jerk or I didn't like the company anymore.

14:58.000 --> 15:07.000
You should answer it with something positive like, well, I think I need a change or this job opportunity is more aligned with what I want to do in the future, et cetera.

15:07.000 --> 15:14.000
Yeah, so positive always on your interviews and just again, prepare for these questions that are always going to be there.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Yes.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
So Erica, I know that you've done a lot of interviews and I understand that you've had a really weird question.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Yes, in an interview, I once got this question.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be? Really?

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah, I'm not kidding. I really was asked that question. What did you answer?

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
I think I said that I would want to be a willow tree because they're really beautiful.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Was that the right answer?

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I don't know. Like, what are you supposed to answer to that question?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I really don't know what the right answer was.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
Well, some people, yeah, they'll ask you just, I don't know, random questions to see what your response is.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
I think also maybe it's just how you deal with with the pressure or with the unexpected questions.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Right.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah, that is pretty unexpected.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
But I guess you handle it pretty well.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Okay, well, I mean, I got the job so...

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Oh, nice.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
All right. I want to know from our listeners if they were a tree, what kind of tree they would be.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
And also tell us about, well, your job experience or your educational background.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Well, I know, for example, that I've had a lot of different types of jobs.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
I've even been that person that gets on the bus and charges people that money.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I know.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
Like, you were at the job under the sun.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
So, but it's great.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
So tell us, what's the weirdest job you've had?

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
What's the craziest or the best job or any experiences?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yes.
