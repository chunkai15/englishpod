00:00.000 --> 00:09.720
Hello English learners, welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod,

00:09.720 --> 00:10.720
my name is Marco.

00:10.720 --> 00:11.720
And I'm Erica.

00:11.720 --> 00:16.400
And today we're bringing you another part of our sport series and this time it's an advanced

00:16.400 --> 00:17.400
lesson.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.400
That's right, we're heading to the mountains today to take a skiing lesson.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.800
Alright, so we're going to be learning about skiing, a winter sport, and very popular

00:25.800 --> 00:26.800
throughout the world.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.920
So before we get started, why don't we take a look at a couple of words in vocabulary

00:30.920 --> 00:31.920
preview.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.560
Very cablory preview.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.280
Alright, so we're going to hear these two words in our dialogue.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.720
The first one is fresh powder.

00:39.720 --> 00:40.720
Fresh powder.

00:40.720 --> 00:41.720
Fresh powder.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.360
Okay, so powder, we probably know this phrase already.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.960
Yep, but here we're talking about fresh light snow.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.320
So fresh light snow, snow that recently fell.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.320
Yep.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.920
Okay, so it looks like powder.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.280
The best kind, the best kind for skiing on.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.920
Okay, the best kind.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.080
Alright, so fresh powder.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.080
What about our next phrase?

01:01.080 --> 01:04.920
Well, we're also going to meet a four time giant slalom champion.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.200
Alright, a four time giant slalom champion.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.200
Okay, so giant slalom is a type of ski race.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.960
When you probably see it on TV when they go down the hill and they have to go through

01:15.960 --> 01:18.000
these red or blue flags, right?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yep.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.920
Now, a four time giant slalom champion means he won the giant slalom four times.

01:24.920 --> 01:30.000
Okay, so this is an interesting way of saying that somebody did something many times.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Right.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
So I can say the three time Nobel Prize winner.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yes, exactly.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Okay.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.640
Or the five time Olympic gold medalist.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.640
Okay, perfect.

01:39.640 --> 01:45.000
So now it's time for us to go to the mountains with our famous Rick Fields and Bob Copeland

01:45.000 --> 01:46.160
and we'll see what happens.

01:54.920 --> 02:01.640
Welcome, ski lovers of all ages, my name is Rick Fields and here with me is the

02:01.640 --> 02:04.080
man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.080
Thank you, Rick.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.280
What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado.

02:08.280 --> 02:12.640
We're the sun is shining and we've got 12 inches of fresh powder.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.840
It doesn't get much better than this.

02:14.840 --> 02:15.840
That's right, Bob.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.480
But today we have a special treat for our viewers.

02:17.480 --> 02:22.560
We're joined here by Enruci for a time giant slalom champion and on this special edition

02:22.560 --> 02:27.040
of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing, so let's hit the slopes.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.560
Well first off, let's get those boots on.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.320
You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.320
That's right.

02:33.320 --> 02:37.000
Now snap them into your bindings and you're also going to want a good pair of goggles

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
to protect your eyes.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.360
It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.320
We don't want you hanging to those mogles.

02:44.320 --> 02:48.720
Bob, since you're a beginner skier in my take a few spills, it's a good idea to have

02:48.720 --> 02:50.720
a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.720
Easy there, Rick.

02:52.720 --> 03:03.000
Well let's head over onto the chair lift and test your skills.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.400
All right, we're up here on the bunny hill, so Bob, why don't you do a few snow plow

03:07.400 --> 03:09.400
turns?

03:09.400 --> 03:10.400
Narlie run, Rick.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.400
Nice carving.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.000
You've got some mad skills.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
That was sick.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
You want to see Narlie?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Well, see that bump over there?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.440
You've got some major air.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.440
What plant?

03:22.440 --> 03:23.840
He lost his skis.

03:23.840 --> 03:24.840
Heard sale.

03:24.840 --> 03:27.320
Well, thanks for joining us here today.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.880
I think that about does it.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.600
Bob, me and time for some apple ski?

03:31.600 --> 03:32.600
No way, man.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.720
We're off to grab some fresh skis.

03:34.720 --> 03:45.920
Pretty embarrassing for Rick there, wasn't it?

03:45.920 --> 03:49.840
Yeah, he was a little bit cocky, and then he ended up falling.

03:49.840 --> 03:54.040
I think there's a lesson in that for all of us, but what the real lesson is today is

03:54.040 --> 03:55.040
language.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.880
So why don't we start with language takeaway?

03:58.880 --> 04:00.040
Language takeaway.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.280
All right, on language takeaway today, let's take a look at the first word.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.480
We have some bindings.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.480
Bindings.

04:07.480 --> 04:12.520
Bindings are sort of like a lock that attaches your boot to your ski.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.760
So those are the bindings.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.760
I guess it comes from the verb to bind.

04:16.760 --> 04:19.360
Yeah, to tie something so that it stays.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.040
Okay, binding.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.640
So for example, my bindings are broken.

04:23.640 --> 04:29.440
Okay, and another piece of skiing equipment and very important is goggles.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.440
goggles.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.160
Okay, we have goggles now.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.480
Yep, not to be confused with Google.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.040
It's spelled almost the same way.

04:36.040 --> 04:41.040
Yep, but goggles are sort of like a big pair of glasses that you wear when you

04:41.040 --> 04:42.040
ski.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.480
So it makes people kind of look like flies.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.480
Yes.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.480
Yeah, these huge glasses.

04:46.480 --> 04:51.200
Yeah, and you'll also see safety goggles, which you might wear if you are a mechanic,

04:51.200 --> 04:55.320
fixing a car, or someone working with wood, or chemicals, or what have you.

04:55.320 --> 05:00.440
Okay, so goggles basically protect your eyes from snow from the sun, from anything.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.440
That's right.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.440
All right.

05:02.440 --> 05:07.040
So moving on to our next ski word, they said, you should wear the goggles that you

05:07.040 --> 05:10.320
don't accidentally go over the moguls.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.320
Okay, moguls.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.640
Okay, moguls, it sounds kind of strange.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.000
What are these things?

05:16.000 --> 05:20.880
Um, basically these are the bumps that are in a ski hill bumps.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.680
Okay, so they're kind of like mini little hills.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.440
Yep.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.000
And they're very difficult to ski over, right?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
That's right.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.880
You got to be pretty good to handle those moguls.

05:29.880 --> 05:30.720
Okay.

05:30.720 --> 05:35.280
Now, since these guys are beginner skiers, they're starting out on the bunny hill.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.440
A bunny hill.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.600
The bunny hill.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.640
Okay, very popular among skiers.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.120
So the bunny hill is the easiest hill.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.560
So it's where the beginners start to learn.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.560
Yeah, all the kids.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.120
All the kids are the bunny hill.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
All right.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.120
And our final words.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.920
Actually, we're going to look at two words here, because they mean almost exactly the

05:52.920 --> 05:54.160
same thing.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.840
We heard the ski instructors say, Narlie.

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
Narlie run.

05:58.840 --> 05:59.840
Yeah, Narlie.

05:59.840 --> 06:04.640
So an interesting word, it spelled Gen A R L E Y.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.960
Okay, so, but you don't say good Narlie.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
No.

06:07.960 --> 06:08.960
You say Narlie.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.640
And a related word, sick.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.600
Okay, now, sick means to be sick, right?

06:14.600 --> 06:16.120
No, no, not here.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.320
Let's listen to some examples to help us understand.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.800
Example one.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.760
Those were some sick dance moves.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.840
You are amazing.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.640
Example two.

06:30.640 --> 06:36.320
Jack and I went to the beach yesterday and served some really Narlie waves.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.480
Example three.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.560
Man, the country last night was sick.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.680
I can't believe we got front row seats.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.600
Okay, so basically Narlie and sick, they mean that it's amazing.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.600
It was cool.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.600
It's awesome.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.600
Awesome.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.600
Yeah.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.200
So these two words are very, very informal.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.200
It's, it's slain.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.200
Yeah.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.600
And actually, skier slang.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.880
Both of these words, I think, originated with skiers, no borders, skateboards.

07:03.880 --> 07:04.880
I'm Narlie dudes.

07:04.880 --> 07:05.880
Narlie dudes.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.880
Okay, so, okay, so that's all the words we have for language.

07:08.880 --> 07:09.880
Let's take away.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.840
But we have some great phrases that we want to take a look at before we listen to

07:13.840 --> 07:14.840
the dialogue again.

07:14.840 --> 07:18.600
So it's time now for fluency builder.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.600
Fluency builder.

07:19.600 --> 07:25.640
All right, so Rick said that it is time to, so Rick invited everyone to start skiing

07:25.640 --> 07:27.880
by saying, let's hit the slopes.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.920
Okay, so to hit the slopes.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.200
To hit the slopes.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.440
Okay, now we want to hit the slopes.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.440
What does that mean?

07:35.440 --> 07:36.440
Go skiing.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.440
Let's go skiing.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
Yeah, let's go to the mountain.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.520
Now we can change the noun slope for something else, right?

07:42.520 --> 07:45.760
Yeah, you can, you can change it for a lot of other different nouns.

07:45.760 --> 07:49.920
And why don't we hear some examples of how you can do that?

07:49.920 --> 07:52.760
Example one.

07:52.760 --> 07:57.560
I really have to hit the books and study for my exam tomorrow.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.200
Example two.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.200
I'm really tired.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.280
I think I'm going to hit the bed now.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.680
Example three.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.680
Funny.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.920
Can we hit the supermarket on our way home?

08:10.920 --> 08:14.160
I need to buy some milk.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.160
Okay, great.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.160
So great examples.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.720
And now we understand how we can use the hit the something.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.720
Mm-hmm.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.720
All right.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.720
What about our next phrase?

08:21.720 --> 08:25.680
Well, Rick warned Bob about he might take a few spills.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.560
Okay, so to take a spill.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.840
To take a spill.

08:28.840 --> 08:29.840
Take a spill.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.840
Fall.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.840
To fall.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.840
Yeah.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.440
It means like a like a light fall or a pretty dramatic fall.

08:35.440 --> 08:36.440
Pretty dramatic.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.440
So yeah.

08:37.440 --> 08:43.120
So for example, instead of saying that little girl was writing her bike and she fell,

08:43.120 --> 08:47.600
I can say that little girl was writing her bike and she took a bad spill.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.600
Yep.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.600
Okay.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.600
So to take a spill.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.000
You have to use the verb take though.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Yes, exactly.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.360
You cannot just spill.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.360
Okay.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.360
You have to take a spill.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.360
Mm-hmm.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.360
All right.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.360
What about our next phrase?

08:59.360 --> 09:02.760
Well, you might take a spill when you catch some major air.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.760
Okay.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.760
Catch some major air.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.640
To catch some major air.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.440
So am I catching something?

09:08.440 --> 09:10.680
How am I catching air that's impossible?

09:10.680 --> 09:13.680
Well, imagine if you're jumping and your skis are catching the air.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.680
Ah, okay.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.680
So I'm in the air for a very long time, maybe?

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
Yeah.

09:18.680 --> 09:22.040
When you catch some air, basically it's like you're flying for a couple seconds.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.360
Do you're flying for a couple of seconds?

09:23.360 --> 09:24.680
You're very high up in the air.

09:24.680 --> 09:25.680
Yep.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.680
Okay.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.680
To catch some air.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
Yeah.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.080
And you hear this phrase, um, when you're, you know, not only when you're talking

09:31.080 --> 09:35.200
about skiing but also maybe if you're, you know, you're driving your car really fast

09:35.200 --> 09:39.240
and it sort of jumps up in the air for a minute, well, not a minute.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.760
A second, that would be catching air as well.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.760
Okay.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.760
So to catch air.

09:43.760 --> 09:44.760
Mm-hmm.

09:44.760 --> 09:45.760
All right.

09:45.760 --> 09:46.760
So they finished skiing.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.840
They were kind of tired and he said, well, let's call it a day.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.240
To call it a day.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.560
Let's call it a day.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.760
Let's go home.

09:52.760 --> 09:53.760
Let's go home.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.760
It's over.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.760
Yes.

09:55.760 --> 09:56.760
Let's finish.

09:56.760 --> 09:57.760
Let's finish the day.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.760
Yep.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.760
Let's call it a day and go home.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.240
But not before we go to our next word, uh, to grab some freshies.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.240
All right.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.240
Grab some freshies.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.240
Grab some freshies.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.240
Okay.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.240
Freshies.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.240
What are these freshies?

10:09.240 --> 10:11.600
Well, remember we talked about fresh powder?

10:11.600 --> 10:12.600
Mm-hmm.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.600
It's that.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.600
So it's an informal way of saying fresh powder.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.600
Yeah.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.600
Fresh powdery light snow.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.600
Okay.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.600
Freshies.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.600
Yep.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.000
So the snow that nobody has skied on before.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.400
Really good phrases and some amazing vocabulary.

10:24.400 --> 10:28.600
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time and then we'll come back and talk a little

10:28.600 --> 10:30.600
bit more about this really fun sport.

10:30.600 --> 10:44.720
Welcome, ski lovers of all ages, my name is Rick Fields and here with me is the

10:44.720 --> 10:47.160
man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
Thank you, Rick.

10:48.160 --> 10:53.960
What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado, where the sun is shining and we've got 12

10:53.960 --> 10:55.720
inches of fresh powder.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.920
It doesn't get much better than this.

10:57.920 --> 10:58.920
That's right, Bob.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.560
We have a special treat for our viewers.

11:00.560 --> 11:05.640
We're joined here by Enruci for a time giant slalom champion and on this special edition

11:05.640 --> 11:06.640
of the show.

11:06.640 --> 11:10.160
En is going to teach us the basics of skiing, so let's hit the slopes.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.640
Well first off, let's get those boots on.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.360
You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.360
That's right.

11:16.360 --> 11:20.080
Now snap them into your bindings and you're also going to want a good pair of goggles

11:20.080 --> 11:21.080
to protect your eyes.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.440
It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.840
We don't want you hanging to those mogles.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.880
Bob, since you're a beginner skier in my take a few spills, it's a good idea to have

11:31.880 --> 11:34.160
a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.560
Easy there, Rick.

11:35.560 --> 11:46.160
Well, let's head over on to the chair lift and test your skills.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.560
All right, we're up here on the bunny hill, so Bob, why don't you do a few snow plow

11:50.560 --> 11:51.560
turns?

11:51.560 --> 11:53.400
Nile you run, Rick.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
Nice carving.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.040
You've got some mad skills.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.040
That was sick.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.040
You want to see Narlie?

11:58.040 --> 11:59.760
Well, see that bump over there?

11:59.760 --> 12:02.280
I'm going to catch some major air.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.280
What plant?

12:04.280 --> 12:06.840
He lost his skis.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
He art-sale.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.320
Well, thanks for joining us here today.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.880
I think that about does it.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.600
Bob, me and time for some apple skis?

12:14.600 --> 12:15.600
No way, man.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.760
We're off to grab some fresh skis.

12:16.760 --> 12:27.000
Well, we heard the guys talk about us.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.040
It's a pretty fresh ski, and actually this is one of my favorite parts of skiing.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.040
What is this?

12:32.040 --> 12:33.040
It sounds French.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.040
Yeah, it is.

12:34.040 --> 12:38.200
I guess the Frenchness sort of gives it an air of specialness, right?

12:38.200 --> 12:42.680
But a pretty ski is basically the party that you have after you're finished skiing.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.640
So usually you would have parties after skiing.

12:45.640 --> 12:50.400
Right, so you finish your ski day, you've called it a day, you've glided down those

12:50.400 --> 12:51.400
slopes.

12:51.400 --> 12:56.960
You head on over to the lodge, the little cabin, grab a beer or two or maybe some

12:57.000 --> 13:01.120
hot alcoholic drink and kick back and relax with your friends.

13:01.120 --> 13:06.640
Wow, so it's popular for families to go to a ski resort and stay there for a couple

13:06.640 --> 13:07.640
of days.

13:07.640 --> 13:10.280
This is when you would do this with your friends or family.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.640
And you know what, if it's with your friends, it's going to last until late into the

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
night.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.160
Alright, so it sounds fun.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.640
And next time, maybe if you go skiing with your friends and you guys are speaking English

13:19.640 --> 13:24.440
now, you can use all these great phrases and maybe surprise your friends if you tell them

13:24.440 --> 13:26.600
that it's going to grab some fresh easy or something like that.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.000
Yeah, you'll sound pretty, pretty, diled, pretty cool.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.280
Alright, so that's all we hit the time we have for today.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.120
Be sure to check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

13:36.120 --> 13:40.120

13:40.120 --> 13:41.120

13:41.120 --> 13:42.120
Goodbye.
