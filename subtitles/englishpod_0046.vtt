00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
Hello everyone, welcome to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

00:05.360 --> 00:11.360
My name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we're going to be talking about an ER and emergency room.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.680
Exactly, we're bringing you our very own ER drama here at EnglishPod.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.640
Yeah, doctors shows are very popular with people medical terms and all that stuff.

00:20.640 --> 00:25.040
Yeah, so we're going to teach you some words that you might hear commonly in medical

00:25.040 --> 00:29.680
shows on TV or in movies. This is really common language in television.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.880
Or even at a hospital, right?

00:30.880 --> 00:34.320
Well, yeah, but let's hope our listeners don't have to face this.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.720
Okay, so let's preview some words in vocabulary preview.

00:37.680 --> 00:38.880
Very cablory preview.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.200
All right, so what's our first word?

00:41.760 --> 00:44.560
Okay, the first word is CPR.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.520
CPR.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.320
CPR.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.840
So that's pretty easy. What does that mean?

00:48.720 --> 00:52.720
Well, it's it's short for cardio pulmonary resuscitation.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.520
Okay, that means anything to you.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.560
Well, cardio is related to the heart.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.040
Uh-huh.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.960
Pulmonary refers to the lungs.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.600
Yep.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.560
Resuscitation means to come back to life.

01:04.560 --> 01:09.360
Yes, so basically CPR is, you know when someone stops breathing,

01:09.920 --> 01:13.040
you put your mouth on their mouth and you breathe inside their lungs.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.240
Okay, to give them air.

01:14.240 --> 01:14.960
Yeah.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.160
Oh, okay.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.120
So CPR.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.160
That's CPR.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.640
Okay, so let's take a look at our next word.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.360
BP.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.400
BP.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.880
So BP is short for blood pressure.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.800
That's just the way that doctors use it in the emergency room.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.000
Exactly, pretty simple.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.520
Okay, so blood pressure and our last word, acute respiratory failure.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.360
Acute respiratory failure.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.960
So what is that exactly?

01:38.960 --> 01:40.160
That sounds complicated.

01:40.160 --> 01:45.280
Um, basically it's really serious that you stop breathing.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.240
You stop breathing.

01:46.240 --> 01:46.800
Yep.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.440
Okay.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.080
So if you go into acute respiratory failure,

01:50.080 --> 01:53.600
then the doctor or somebody has to perform CPR.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.240
Right.

01:54.240 --> 01:54.880
All right.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.920
Cool.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.880
Okay, so we've, so we've previewed these three great words.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.600
Now let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.560
It's going to be really fast and you're going to have a lot of drama in it.

02:04.560 --> 02:07.120
So, uh, don't worry if you don't understand everything.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.000
Yeah, we're going to come back and teach you some of the important language.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.400
Help!

02:22.400 --> 02:24.000
Are you a doctor?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.400
I pour a little Frankie, he's just stopped breathing.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.240
Oh my gosh, help me.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.840
I tried to perform CPR, but I just, I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

02:31.840 --> 02:32.880
Oh, Frankie.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.160
Ellen, uh, get him hook up to a monitor.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.040
Somebody page Dr. Houser, get the patient hold still.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.120
I can't get a pulse.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.880
Okay, he's on the monitor.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.320
His BP is falling.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.360
He's flat landing.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.880
No!

02:48.880 --> 02:51.760
Frankie, that didn't do something.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.320
Someone get her out of here.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.080
Get me the defibrillator.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.440
Okay, clear.

02:59.040 --> 02:59.840
Again, clear.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.000
Come on, damn it.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.440
I'm not letting go of you.

03:03.440 --> 03:03.840
Clear!

03:05.440 --> 03:06.480
You got a pulse?

03:06.480 --> 03:08.240
Okay, what's happening?

03:08.240 --> 03:10.080
Patient is in acute respiratory failure.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.440
I think we're going to have to innovate.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.680
All right, tubes in.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.320
Bagum.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.640
Somebody given 10cc's shot of adrenaline.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.360
Let's go.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.320
People move.

03:18.320 --> 03:18.720
Move!

03:22.000 --> 03:27.840
Dr. Oh, thank God.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.720
How is he?

03:29.520 --> 03:31.600
We've managed to stabilize Frankie,

03:31.600 --> 03:33.200
but he's not out of the woods yet.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.360
He's still in critical condition.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.160
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

03:38.160 --> 03:38.800
Dr.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.360
Just do whatever it takes.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.200
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.960
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

03:51.920 --> 03:56.960
Wow, so much drama over a little hamster.

03:56.960 --> 03:57.840
Yeah, a little pet.

03:57.840 --> 03:58.720
A little pet.

03:58.720 --> 03:59.840
A little hamster.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.960
Well, you know what?

04:00.960 --> 04:02.960
I can relate to this owner,

04:02.960 --> 04:05.440
and I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that later.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.440
Yeah, I know you have a really good story about this.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.120
Yeah, but in the meantime, let's look at some great language in language takeaway.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.840
Language takeaway.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.680
All right, so let's take a look at our first word.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.360
Intubate.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.320
Intubate.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.120
Intubate.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.480
So this is a medical procedure.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.120
Exactly.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.320
When a patient can't breathe properly,

04:28.320 --> 04:32.480
sometimes the doctor takes a long tube and puts it into their mouth

04:32.480 --> 04:36.000
and down their pipes, I guess, down their breathing tube.

04:36.000 --> 04:36.480
Right.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.840
So that they can breathe better.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.240
Okay, so that's to intubate.

04:40.240 --> 04:40.800
Yes.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.360
Okay, so once they've intubated the patient,

04:43.360 --> 04:45.040
they start to bag him.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.400
Yeah, bag him.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.280
Bag him.

04:47.280 --> 04:47.840
Bag him.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.840
Does that mean they put a bag over the distance?

04:49.840 --> 04:51.120
No, there's nothing.

04:51.280 --> 04:55.280
So there's a bag attached to this intubation tube

04:55.280 --> 04:57.120
and you squeeze it to put air into the lungs.

04:57.120 --> 05:01.520
Okay, so you squeeze this bag and it puts air through the tube.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.600
I think this is just medical slang.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.800
Yeah, I guess bag him.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.720
Yeah, but you hear all the time when TV.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.320
So it's important our listeners know it.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.760
Okay, let's look at our next word, critical condition.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.040
Critical condition.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.400
Critical condition.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.240
The patients in critical condition.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.880
This condition means it's serious.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.600
Right, if a patient is in critical condition,

05:21.600 --> 05:25.360
they're either really, really hurt or really, really sick.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.120
And they could die pretty soon.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.160
Okay, so you don't want to be in critical condition?

05:30.160 --> 05:31.120
No.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.760
Let's take a look at our next word, Stabilize.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.880
Stabilize.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.920
Stabilize.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.040
Stabilize.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
So when the doctors stabilize a patient,

05:39.040 --> 05:41.280
they take that patient out of danger.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.400
Exactly, when a patient is stabilized,

05:44.400 --> 05:46.800
they probably won't die in five minutes.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.880
Okay, but they could still be really sick.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.800
They could be in critical condition, right?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.000
But it's under control.

05:52.000 --> 05:52.640
Exactly.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.520
Okay, yeah.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.880
Stabilize.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.600
Let's look at our last word, ICU.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.800
ICU.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.920
ICU.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.360
Intensive care units.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.480
Okay, that's what it means, intensive care unit.

06:04.480 --> 06:04.720
Yep.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.840
So that's the place where patients who are in critical condition

06:07.840 --> 06:08.720
are taken.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.600
Right.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.640
So what's the difference between a ICU and a regular room?

06:12.640 --> 06:15.040
Well, I don't know, I've never been in one.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.480
But I think like patients are monitored regularly.

06:18.480 --> 06:24.080
And I think there's maybe more nurses and fewer patients.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.840
There's just a higher level of care.

06:25.840 --> 06:26.960
A higher level of care.

06:26.960 --> 06:27.600
Yeah.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.280
Okay, okay, so it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

06:31.280 --> 06:35.280
Now try to catch all of these medical terms that we just talked about.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.040
And then we'll come back and explain a few phrases.

06:37.200 --> 06:41.680
Help.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.200
Are you a doctor?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.680
My poor little Frankie has just stopped breathing.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.520
Oh my gosh, help me.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.120
I tried to perform CPR, but I just, I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.160
Oh, Frankie.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.440
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.280
Somebody page Dr. Houser.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.320
Get the patient hold still.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.320
I can't get a pulse.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.280
Okay, he's on the monitor.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.640
His BP's falling.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.680
He's flatlining.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.400
No, Frankie.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.240
Doctor, do something.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.520
Someone get her out of here.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.120
Get me the defibrillator.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.720
Okay, clear.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.120
Again, clear.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.560
Come on, Dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

07:22.560 --> 07:22.960
Clear.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.280
I got a pulse.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.360
Okay, what's happening?

07:27.360 --> 07:29.280
The patient is in acute respiratory failure.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.720
I think we're going to have to innovate.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.960
All right, tubes in.

07:33.040 --> 07:33.600
Bagum.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.920
Somebody given 10 C's, he's shot of adrenaline.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.640
Let's go.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.000
People move, move.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.600
Doctor, oh, thank God.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.400
How is he?

07:43.280 --> 07:46.880
We've managed to stabilize Frankie, but he's not out of the woods yet.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.040
He's still in critical condition.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.840
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

07:51.840 --> 07:55.040
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.880
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.640
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

08:03.920 --> 08:08.320
Okay, so there are some really good phrasal verbs in this dialogue.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.920
Yeah, a couple of good phrasal verbs.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.280
Okay, so let's take a look at these phrasal verbs and putting it together.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.080
Put you in it together.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.720
All right, so what's our first phrasal verb today?

08:20.720 --> 08:21.920
Hook, up.

08:21.920 --> 08:22.800
Hook, up.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.920
Hook, up.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.520
So to hook, up.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.920
So when we talk about hooking something up,

08:28.640 --> 08:32.320
we are usually talking about electronics, right, Marco?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.880
Yeah, you usually hook up your TV or your computer.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.560
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we would use hookup?

08:39.760 --> 08:40.720
Example one.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.520
I finally got an intendo we.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.600
Come on, help me hook it up to the TV.

08:50.720 --> 08:51.520
Example two.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.600
I don't know how to hook up this new DVD player.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.400
Can you help me?

08:58.480 --> 09:03.120
Example three.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.920
I just hooked up my new HD TV.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.600
Wanna come over and watch a movie?

09:15.280 --> 09:20.320
Great, so you can see that there are a few different variations of this pattern here with the word

09:20.320 --> 09:22.000
hookup because it's a phrasal verb.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.880
Exactly.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.480
And I think the same patterns can apply to our next phrasal verb.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.240
Hold still.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.440
Hold still.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.720
Hold still.

09:30.720 --> 09:31.840
Hold still.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.640
So the doctor needed the patient to hold still.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.080
Right, to stop moving.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.920
Stop moving, exactly.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.280
Okay, let's listen to some more examples of hold still because again,

09:41.280 --> 09:44.240
it's a really great phrasal verb that you can change up a little bit.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.040
Example one.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.360
If you don't hold still, I can't see if you have something in your eye.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.440
Example two.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.000
Hold still while she cuts your hair or else she might make a mistake.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.560
Example three.

10:19.840 --> 10:20.800
Hold still.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.080
You have a B on your back.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.720
Okay, hold still.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.280
Great word.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.320
All right, one final phrase for you.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.920
Out of the woods.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.440
Out of the woods.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.480
Out of the woods.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.280
Out of the woods.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.960
So when someone's out of the woods, they're free from danger.

10:38.960 --> 10:39.760
Uh-huh, safe.

10:39.760 --> 10:40.400
Okay, safe.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.040
Yeah.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.560
I guess it's kind of a saying.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.040
Yeah.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.080
I'm out of the woods.

10:44.080 --> 10:44.400
Yeah.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.680
I'm free.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.640
I'm safe.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.560
I guess there are two variants of this phrase.

10:48.560 --> 10:51.280
We can say, I'm out of the woods or we're out of the woods.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.280
Or I guess we're not out of the woods.

10:53.280 --> 10:53.680
Yes.

10:53.680 --> 10:54.320
Uh-huh.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.960
So, okay, out of the woods.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.720
Okay, so now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.560
And when we come back, Eric is going to tell us about her ER story.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.760
Help!

11:15.760 --> 11:17.280
Are you a doctor?

11:17.280 --> 11:18.320
I pour a little Frankie.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.840
He's just half breathing.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.600
Oh my gosh, help me.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.360
I tried to perform CPR, but I just...

11:23.360 --> 11:25.200
I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.320
Oh, Frankie.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.600
Ellen, uh, get him hooked up to a monitor.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.440
Somebody page Dr. Houser.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.400
Get the patient hold still.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.480
Now I can't get a pulse.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.320
Okay, he's on the monitor.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.760
His BP's falling.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.720
He's flat landing.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.240
No!

11:42.240 --> 11:45.120
Frankie, don't do something!

11:46.080 --> 11:47.600
Someone get her out of here.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.360
Get me the defibrillator.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.880
Okay, clear.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.200
Again, clear.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.240
Come on, Dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.200
Clear!

11:58.240 --> 11:59.440
You're about to pulse?

11:59.440 --> 12:01.040
Okay, what's happening?

12:01.040 --> 12:03.040
Patient is in acute respiratory failure.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
I think we're going to have to innovate.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.800
All right, tubes in.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.440
Bagum.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.760
Somebody given 10 CC's shot of adrenaline.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.640
Let's go!

12:10.640 --> 12:12.080
People move, move!

12:18.720 --> 12:20.720
Doctor, oh, thank God.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.080
How is he?

12:22.960 --> 12:24.960
We've managed to stabilize Frankie,

12:24.960 --> 12:26.560
but he's not out of the woods yet.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.720
He's still in critical condition.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.520
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

12:31.520 --> 12:34.720
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.720
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.320
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.960
Okay, Eric, so what happened?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.640
What emergency did you have?

12:48.640 --> 12:49.920
Well, it was with my cat.

12:49.920 --> 12:50.640
Your cat.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.840
Yes, I had some people

12:51.840 --> 12:55.680
over for dinner, and it was maybe one 30 in the morning,

12:55.680 --> 12:58.560
and they went downstairs to let them out and show them

12:58.560 --> 13:00.160
where the taxis were, and then I came up,

13:00.160 --> 13:01.440
and I saw that the cat was gone.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.640
And it turned out that the cat fell out of the window.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.560
Fell out of the window.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.200
Yeah!

13:07.200 --> 13:10.400
All right, but our listeners have to know what story,

13:10.400 --> 13:11.920
or what floor do you live on?

13:11.920 --> 13:12.720
The 20th floor.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.520
The 20th.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.840
Yeah, so this is really dangerous, right?

13:15.840 --> 13:16.960
That's really high up.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.320
So I went outside and I was calling for my cat,

13:20.320 --> 13:22.240
and I was like, Mr. Finn, where are you?

13:22.240 --> 13:23.280
How did you know he fell out?

13:23.280 --> 13:24.080
I just knew.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.680
Yeah, mother's instinct.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.480
I guess so.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.200
And so he was calling back to me,

13:29.200 --> 13:31.760
and I was like, picked him up and brought him to the house,

13:31.760 --> 13:33.600
and we had to bring him to the vet.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.080
And it was, you know, 233 in the morning at this time,

13:36.080 --> 13:39.360
and the vet was like, not very happy that we woke him up out of bed.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.800
But that was a really good emergency, though.

13:42.800 --> 13:43.440
Yeah.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.760
So anyway, we brought him to the vet.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.920
He was in critical condition for a couple of days,

13:48.880 --> 13:52.720
and then we had to keep him in the vet's ICU for about a week.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.880
He broke his back.

13:54.880 --> 13:57.360
He broke his two of his legs.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.960
And so he was in the hospital for three weeks,

14:00.960 --> 14:04.480
and then at home, on bed rest for another three weeks.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.400
But now he's good as new.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.200
Good as new.

14:07.200 --> 14:07.600
Yeah.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.640
He used up one of his seven lives in life.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.440
Nine, nine.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.240
Yeah.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.000
I think maybe eight of his nine lives.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.440
He's only what got one left.

14:15.440 --> 14:15.920
Yeah.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.200
Wow, that's an interesting story.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.240
I guess that's the inspiration under this dialogue.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.120
Exactly.

14:21.120 --> 14:25.600
Sometimes we anglo's really treats our cats and our hamps.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.280
There's in our dogs like they're our children.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.040
Yeah, yeah, no, that's good.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.400
Well, I'm glad Mr. Finn is okay and he's walking and good as new.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.360
Yep, good as new.

14:33.360 --> 14:39.200
So maybe our users have some stories about their pets being taken to the hospital.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.000
I want to hear.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.120
Yeah, that should be interesting.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.160
I've never had a pet actually a break away or anything,

14:44.160 --> 14:46.400
so don't have any pet stories this time.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.000
But we want to hear what you think.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.680

Goodbye.
