00:00.000 --> 00:06.700
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:06.700 --> 00:07.700
I'm Amira.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.400
Hey, Amira, how are you today?

00:09.400 --> 00:11.000
I'm doing great. What about you?

00:11.000 --> 00:12.600
I'm doing pretty good.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.400
I'm excited about this lesson that you have for us today.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.400
Yes, it's actually a very, very useful lesson.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.400
It's about someone asking his boss for an assistant.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.900
Okay, an assistant. What's an assistant?

00:25.900 --> 00:29.000
Well, it's someone who helps you with your work around the office.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.300
Okay, great.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.200
So let's listen to this dialogue.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.200
And when we come back,

00:34.200 --> 00:38.200
we'll take a look at all the interesting and useful vocabulary that you'll find.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.500
Like I told you before,

00:49.500 --> 00:53.000
we just don't have the resources to hire you an assistant.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
I understand that,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.400
but the fact is we're understaffed.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.200
The timing is just not right.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
The economy's bad,

00:59.200 --> 01:01.800
and it's too risky to take on new staff.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.400
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.400
Here's an idea.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.300
What if we hire an intern?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.600
She would take some of the weight off my shoulders.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.700
She?

01:09.700 --> 01:11.600
Yeah, you know, a recent graduate.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.600
She could give me a hand with some of these projects,

01:13.600 --> 01:15.500
and we could keep our costs down.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.000
That sounds reasonable.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.500
Let me see what I can do.

01:19.500 --> 01:28.500
Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.000
Okay, great. Let's meet her.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.500
Hi, I'm Adam.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.500
Oh, hi, I'm Tony.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.000
And we're back.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Tony, he's surprised, huh?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah, he's a,

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't know why though,

01:47.000 --> 01:47.800
he's surprised.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.300
I think we should talk about that a little bit later.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.300
Yes, for now,

01:51.300 --> 01:55.400
let's look at some interesting vocabulary and phrases here.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.400
Marco, I know you've chosen one for us.

01:57.400 --> 02:01.400
Yeah, the first one that I want to take a look at is resources.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.000
Resources.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.300
Resources.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.600
Resources.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.000
And that means in this text, basically, money.

02:09.000 --> 02:09.500
Right.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.700
So the office doesn't have enough money.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.400
Okay, I've chosen another interesting word for you,

02:15.400 --> 02:17.900
and that's understaffed.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.100
Understaffed.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.700
Understaffed.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.300
Understaffed.

02:22.300 --> 02:28.700
Now, understaffed means that they don't have enough people working there.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.600
They don't have enough workers.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.800
Right, they don't have enough employees.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.600
Perfect.

02:33.600 --> 02:38.300
Okay, the next one is timing is just not right.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.900
The timing is just not right.

02:40.900 --> 02:43.900
The timing is just not right.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.500
The timing is just not right.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.500
Okay, let's listen to how we can use this entire phrase

02:51.500 --> 02:53.200
in a different situation,

02:53.200 --> 02:55.700
so then we can understand what it means.

02:55.700 --> 02:56.700
Let's listen.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.200
I was going to sell my house, but the timing is just not right.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.600
Honey, I think we should have a baby.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.200
The timing is just not right.

03:19.900 --> 03:20.800
Okay, great.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.200
I guess that makes it clear.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.000
Yes, actually, it's very obvious that it means

03:26.000 --> 03:27.900
that it's just not a good time.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.200
Right, perfect.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.600
I have another interesting phrase for you,

03:31.600 --> 03:34.800
which is, wait off my shoulders.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.700
Wait off my shoulders.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.900
Wait off my shoulders.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.100
Wait off my shoulders.

03:41.100 --> 03:44.400
So, to take weight of my shoulders

03:44.400 --> 03:47.800
is another way of saying to help me with my work

03:47.800 --> 03:50.600
or to take some of my work away from me.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.500
If you have a lot of things to do and I come and help you,

03:54.500 --> 03:57.700
that means that I took some of the weight off your shoulders.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.400
Yes.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.500
Let's look at the next phrase that we have here

04:01.500 --> 04:03.100
and it's give me a hand.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.800
Give me a hand.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.400
Give me a hand.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.800
Give me a hand.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.600
Okay, now this is not literal.

04:09.700 --> 04:13.300
It's not that I'm going to give you somebody's hand, right?

04:13.300 --> 04:15.000
Let's listen to some examples

04:15.000 --> 04:19.200
and then we can come back and explain what it means.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
Can you give me a hand with these boxes?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.800
Neil, I'll need you to give me a hand

04:36.800 --> 04:38.600
with the sales reports.

04:39.700 --> 04:46.700
Here, let me give you a hand with your suitcase.

04:52.100 --> 04:52.900
All right.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.900
Give me a hand is another way of saying

04:55.900 --> 04:58.100
help or to help out.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.100
Exactly.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.100
To help out.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.100
Perfect.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.100
Now, the last phrase we're going to look at here

05:04.100 --> 05:07.700
in this dialogue is keep our costs down.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.600
Keep our costs down.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.100
Keep our costs down.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.800
Keep our costs down.

05:14.800 --> 05:21.300
So, to keep our costs down means to try and not spend so much money.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.100
Exactly.

05:22.100 --> 05:27.600
Many companies, for example, now control how much printing you do.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
Yes.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.600
Right, to keep the cost down of paper.

05:30.600 --> 05:36.600
Yes, so in other words, they do not want to have unnecessary spending.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.600
Perfect.

05:37.700 --> 05:42.500
OK, I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue one more time.

05:42.500 --> 05:48.000
But I want everyone to listen and see why Tony is surprised

05:48.000 --> 05:51.500
at the end when he meets his intern, when he meets his assistant.

06:02.300 --> 06:07.000
Like I told you before, we just don't have the resources to hire you an assistant.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.300
I understand that, but the fact is, we're under staffed.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.200
The timing is just not right.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.800
The economy's bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.400
Yeah, I guess you're right.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.400
Here's an idea.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.300
What if we hire an intern?

06:20.300 --> 06:22.600
She would take some of the weight off my shoulders.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.700
She?

06:23.700 --> 06:25.600
Yeah, you know, a recent graduate.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.500
She could give me a hand with some of these projects, and we could keep our costs down.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.000
That sounds reasonable.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.500
Let me see what I can do.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
OK, great.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Let's meet her.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Hi, I'm Adam.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Oh, hi, I'm Tony.

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
Well, you know, Marco, I think that Tony was really surprised because he was kind of hoping to have a female intern.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah, I think that's exactly what he was expecting.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Maybe this guy is a little bit sexist.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
He thought that an intern should be a girl, but instead he was...

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Instead, he got Adam.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
Exactly, and it looks like Adam is really big and really tall because he's got that deep voice.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Right.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
An intern, Marco, do you want to elaborate on that?

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
Working at a company with a very low salary or sometimes no salary at all,

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
but what you're gaining is experience and you're learning a lot of things.

07:37.000 --> 07:47.000
Everyone who has been an intern or had an intern knows that sometimes they are not treated all that well.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Sometimes they just serve coffee or they have to do paperwork.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Or like photocopying things.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Exactly.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
Internships are really, really cool and some are really good experiences for learning.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, definitely.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
Actually, I know a friend of mine, she used to work as an intern in one of those really big companies.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
And she told me that she has gained so much experience doing that.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, I mean, even if you don't get paid, the experience that you get is really good.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
And that just opens doors for maybe getting another job.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
Or sometimes the interns get hired by the company to stay because they do such a good job.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah, I think that's mostly the case, huh?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah, that happened to me once.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
I started working as an intern and after three months, I was hired by the company.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
So it does happen.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
You did a good job.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, of course.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
All right, folks, we're out of time today.

08:48.000 --> 08:56.000
I hope that you enjoyed our lesson and we'll be back tomorrow with another really cool and really interesting lesson from EnglishPod.

08:56.000 --> 09:07.000
Don't forget to come to our website at EnglishPod.com where you'll find some really great and interesting resources to help you learn and improve your English even more.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Yes, you should definitely do that.

09:09.000 --> 09:18.000
And Marco and I would love to receive your comments and suggestions that you can leave on our community forum.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
But for now, it's time for us to say bye.
