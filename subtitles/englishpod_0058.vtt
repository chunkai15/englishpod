00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello English learners, welcome back to English Odd, my name is Marco.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.800
And I'm Erica.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.700
And today we have a great lesson for all our upper intermediate students.

00:11.700 --> 00:12.300
That's right.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.100
We're talking about airplane travel today.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.800
Airplane travel, all right.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.500
So we're going to be in an airplane.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.000
Yes.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.300
And we're going to be listening to some of the common things you might hear on an announcement in the airplane.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.300
Yeah, usually the flight attendant or the captain will come on and say something.

00:28.300 --> 00:31.300
Well, usually it's an English, so we got to understand what they're saying.

00:31.300 --> 00:31.800
That's right.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.800
And we'll also learn some great phrases that you can use when you want to describe flights to your friends.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.800
When you talk to them.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.800
Yeah, that always happens.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.800
You arrive somewhere and people are like, hey, how was your flight?

00:41.800 --> 00:43.300
Now you know how to answer it.

00:43.300 --> 00:43.800
Exactly.

00:43.800 --> 00:44.800
Okay.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.800
So why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview?

00:48.800 --> 00:50.800
Very vocabulary preview.

00:50.800 --> 00:55.800
Well, we've got three words for you here in vocabulary preview all about flying.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.800
Okay.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
So what's our first one?

00:57.800 --> 00:58.800
Turbulence.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.800
Turbulence.

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
Turbulence.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
Turbulence.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
So turbulence.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.800
How can we describe this?

01:04.800 --> 01:11.800
Well, turbulence when you're in an airplane basically is air that is moving in all directions really fast.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.800
Okay.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
So what happens?

01:13.800 --> 01:15.800
So the airplane will start to shake.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.800
Okay.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
Right.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
Yeah.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.800
It's the same thing if you're flying a kite and maybe some turbulence is in the air.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.800
Your kite will maybe fall to the ground.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.800
Oh.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.800
So it's air that's moving in all directions.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.800
It's really turbulent.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.800
All right.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.800
Well, we'll hear how this word is used in the dialogue.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.800
But another airplane word.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.800
We hear a lot.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
Crue.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.800
Crue.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.800
Crue.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.800
Flight crew.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
Yes.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
CRE.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.800
So the flight crew is basically the team.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
Yes.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.800
Right.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
Yep.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.800
It's all the people that are in the airplane.

01:47.800 --> 01:52.800
So it's basically the captain and the copilot and all the flight attendants.

01:52.800 --> 01:53.800
Exactly.

01:53.800 --> 01:54.800
Yeah.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
That's the flight crew.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.800
Yes.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
Okay.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.800
And what about our last word?

01:59.800 --> 02:00.800
Bumpy ride.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.800
Bumpy ride.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.800
A bumpy ride.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.800
Bumpy.

02:03.800 --> 02:04.800
Not smooth.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
Not smooth.

02:05.800 --> 02:06.800
Yeah.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.800
So what would be an example of a bumpy ride?

02:08.800 --> 02:09.800
Okay.

02:09.800 --> 02:14.800
Imagine if you're driving in your car and you're driving on a dirt road.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.800
Like with many holes in it and everything.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.800
And rocks.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800
Yes.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.800
You're driving on that road and it would be really, really bumpy.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.800
Right.

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
So your car will be moving a lot.

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
Yeah.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.800
Yeah.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.800
So a bumpy ride is a trip where you move and shake a lot.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.800
It's kind of uncomfortable.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.800
So you can say that is a bumpy road.

02:31.800 --> 02:32.800
Or it was a bumpy ride.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.800
It was a bumpy ride.

02:33.800 --> 02:34.800
Yeah.

02:34.800 --> 02:35.800
Okay.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.800
So now let's listen to our dialogue.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.800
We're going to be listening to these people on an airplane and the captain is going

02:41.800 --> 02:42.800
to give some instructions.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.800
And the next thing you know, we're running towards the...

02:57.800 --> 02:58.800
Oh.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.800
Did you feel that?

03:00.800 --> 03:01.800
Yeah.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.800
Don't worry about it.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.800
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.800
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.800
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.800
So we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.800
This is why I hate flying.

03:13.800 --> 03:17.800
At this time, I'd like to remind our passengers to fasten their seatbelts and remain seated

03:17.800 --> 03:19.800
until the fasten seatbelt sign is turned off.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.800
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stowed under the seat in front of you.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.800
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.800
Did you hear that?

03:26.800 --> 03:27.800
Oh my god.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
Brent!

03:28.800 --> 03:29.800
Don't worry about it.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.800
This is totally normal.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.800
It happens all that.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.800
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.800
We've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.800
And so, for your safety, we will be suspending in flight service.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.800
I would ask all the inflate crew to return to their seat at this time.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.800
I would also ask that all our passengers are afraid for using the laboratory

03:48.800 --> 03:50.800
until the seatbelt sign has a switch stop.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.800
We can expect.

03:51.800 --> 04:20.800
Well, here we are with another dramatic dialogue, another explosion in English pod.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.800
What's happening?

04:22.800 --> 04:23.800
I don't know.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.800
A lot of adventure is going on, so we'll see what happens.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.800
But I'm sure they're all right.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.800
Don't worry everyone else.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.800
Well, I hope so.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.800
It's kind of making me nervous for my next flight.

04:32.800 --> 04:33.800
Alright.

04:33.800 --> 04:39.800
So let's take a look at some of the words that the captain used in language takeaway.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.800
Language takeaway.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.800
Alright, all of these words, you'll hear really, really often when you're flying.

04:46.800 --> 04:53.800
The first one we have for you is fasten, fasten, fasten your seatbelt.

04:53.800 --> 04:59.800
Now this is a great word, fasten means to do up, do up or put on or connect.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.800
Connect, right?

05:00.800 --> 05:04.800
So usually it'll be with a seatbelt or a belt or something like that, right?

05:04.800 --> 05:05.800
Yeah.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.800
Now the pronunciation here is interesting.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.800
Yes.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.800
It's spelled F-A-S-T-E-N.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.800
Right, so it would be fast and no.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.800
No, right.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.800
Fasten.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.800
Fasten.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.800
The key kind of becomes silent.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
So it's fastened.

05:20.800 --> 05:21.800
Yep.

05:21.800 --> 05:22.800
Okay.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.800
Let's look at our next word, laboratory.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.800
Laboratory.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.800
Laboratory.

05:27.800 --> 05:28.800
Laboratory.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.800
Laboratory.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.800
Okay, so what is laboratory exactly?

05:31.800 --> 05:32.800
Because I'm always confused.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.800
What's the difference between bathroom, restroom, washroom,

05:36.800 --> 05:38.800
WC, laboratory?

05:38.800 --> 05:40.800
I know, so many words for bathroom.

05:40.800 --> 05:45.800
A laboratory is a room with a toilet and sink only.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
Only a toilet and sink.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.800
So no bathtub.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.800
No.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.800
No shower, either.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
No shower.

05:50.800 --> 05:56.800
So it's very, very common to find a laboratory in boats, airplanes, or trains.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.800
Yep.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
But never in your house.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.800
Never in your house.

05:59.800 --> 06:03.800
Even if your room in your house is only a sink in a toilet, it's still not a laboratory.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.800
It's a bathroom.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.800
Yeah.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.800
Okay.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.800
I don't know why.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.800
That's just the way it is in English.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.800
And something interesting that you told me today, double you see, right?

06:13.800 --> 06:15.800
That's a common thing that you'll see on a bathroom.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.800
Yep.

06:16.800 --> 06:17.800
What is that stand for?

06:17.800 --> 06:18.800
Water closet.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.800
Water closet.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.800
Yep.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.800
Wow, I didn't know that.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.800
Yeah.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.800
Water closet.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.800
Okay.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.800
Anyways.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
Let's take a look at our next word.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.800
Stone.

06:27.800 --> 06:28.800
Stone.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.800
To stone.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.800
Yes.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.800
Stow your luggage.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.800
So if I stole my luggage, it means.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.800
You put it in a place where you can get it easily, but it is very safe.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.800
And maybe it's not even visible, right?

06:40.800 --> 06:41.800
Yeah.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.800
So you put it away in a safe spot.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.800
Okay.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.800
So usually in airplanes, they will tell you to stow your luggage under your seat.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.800
Yes.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.800
Or stow your luggage in the overhead bin.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.800
Over a head bin or overhead compartment.

06:54.800 --> 06:55.800
Yes.

06:55.800 --> 06:56.800
Okay.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
And our last word.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
Refrain.

06:59.800 --> 07:00.800
Refrain.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.800
Refrain from doing something.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.800
Mm-hmm.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.800
So this is a verb, meaning a void doing.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.800
A void doing.

07:07.800 --> 07:08.800
Exactly.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.800
Something interesting about this grammar wise is it's usually followed by from.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.800
Yeah.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.800
Refrain from.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.800
And the verb that follows is always a jaren, right?

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
Yeah.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.800
So refrain from ING.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.800
Right.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.800
Refrain from using the laboratory.

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800
Yes.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
Refrain from smoking.

07:25.800 --> 07:26.800
Refrain from smoking.

07:26.800 --> 07:27.800
Okay.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.800
So refrain from.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
Yeah.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
All right.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.800
So some really great examples in language takeaway.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.800
Yeah.

07:33.800 --> 07:38.800
Well, now let's take a look at fluency builder and see some of these great phrases.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.800
Fluency builder.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.800
All right.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.800
Three phrases we have for you here.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.800
The first one.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.800
Remain seated.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.800
Remain seated.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
Remain seated.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.800
Remain seated.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.800
Remain seated.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
So to remain seated.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.800
Really simple.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.800
To stay sitting.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.800
To stay on your seat.

07:56.800 --> 07:57.800
Don't stand up.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.800
Yes.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.800
This is really important in airplanes, right?

08:00.800 --> 08:01.800
Yeah.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.800
There's turbulence.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.800
You could, you know, end up flying around the airplane.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.800
They're falling exactly in hurt yourself.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.800
Remain seated.

08:09.800 --> 08:15.300
Now one of the reasons they had to remain seated was because they were going to go through

08:15.300 --> 08:17.800
a patch of rough air.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.800
Patch of rough air.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.800
So patch.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.800
Now interesting.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.800
Okay.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.800
So patch is a small area, right?

08:24.800 --> 08:25.800
Yeah.

08:25.800 --> 08:26.800
Yeah.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.800
So a small area of turbulence.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.800
A small area of turbulence.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.800
Now what would be another example of patch?

08:31.800 --> 08:35.800
Maybe a patch of strawberries.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.800
So it's like a little strawberry garden, right?

08:37.800 --> 08:38.800
Yes.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.800
Or a patch of grass.

08:39.800 --> 08:40.800
Patch of grass.

08:40.800 --> 08:43.800
Usually in front of your house, you'll have a little patch of grass.

08:43.800 --> 08:44.800
Yep.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.800
Okay.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.800
So patch of.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.800
And now our last phrase.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.800
Suspend.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.800
Suspend.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.800
Suspend.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.800
In flight service.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.800
Yeah.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.800
So stop for a short time.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.800
Stop for a short time.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.800
So you could suspend your work.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.800
Yeah.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.800
And if you're going on vacation, you could suspend your subscription to the newspaper.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
Mm-hmm.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.800
Okay.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.800
So suspend to temporarily stop.

09:07.800 --> 09:08.800
Yes.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
Okay.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.800
So we've covered a lot of vocabulary and some great phrases.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.800
Mm-hmm.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.800
So why don't we listen to our dialogue one more time.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.800
And we'll come back and talk about line.

09:17.800 --> 09:30.800
And the next thing you know, we're running towards the, oh.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.800
Did you feel that?

09:32.800 --> 09:33.800
Yeah.

09:33.800 --> 09:34.800
Don't worry about it.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.800
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.800
Light and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.800
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.800
So we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.800
This is why I hate flying.

09:45.800 --> 09:49.800
At this time, I'd like to remind of our passengers to fasten their seat belts and remain seated

09:49.800 --> 09:51.800
until the fasten seat belts sign is turned off.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.800
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stood under the seat in front of you.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
I'll be back to update you in a minutes.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.800
Did you hear that?

09:58.800 --> 09:59.800
Oh my god.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.800
But don't worry about it.

10:01.800 --> 10:02.800
This is totally normal.

10:02.800 --> 10:03.800
It happens all that.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.800
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.800
Again, we've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.800
And so for your safety, we will be suspending in flight service.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.800
I would ask all the inflate crew to return to the seat at this time.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.800
I would also ask that all our passengers are afraid for using the laboratory

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
until the seat belt sign hasn't switched off.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.800
We can expect.

10:44.800 --> 10:49.800
Erica, have you ever had a turbulent flight like this?

10:49.800 --> 10:50.800
No, no, never this bad.

10:50.800 --> 10:51.800
A little bit of turbulence.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.800
Actually, kind of like turbulent flight.

10:53.800 --> 10:54.800
Why?

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
It's sort of like, I don't know.

10:55.800 --> 10:56.800
It's kind of fine.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.800
You get shaking around.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.800
You're like stomach moves up and down.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.800
You don't like nervous?

11:00.800 --> 11:01.800
No, I get a little excited.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.800
Well, it is true that flying is actually very, very safe, right?

11:05.800 --> 11:06.800
Yeah.

11:06.800 --> 11:12.800
I know we all hear that more people are killed in car accidents than a flight accidents.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.800
So it's very, very safe.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.800
So yeah, I don't worry about the turbulence.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.800
Yeah, not on wood.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.800
Yeah, so flying is really safe.

11:20.800 --> 11:25.800
And as long as you remain seated, you're fast in your seat belt and you follow the instructions,

11:25.800 --> 11:26.800
you shouldn't have any problems.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.800
Yeah, actually, that's a really good point.

11:28.800 --> 11:32.800
Because actually, when I was reading about turbulence for this dialogue,

11:32.800 --> 11:36.800
I kept reading all these stories about these people who, you know,

11:36.800 --> 11:38.800
when they got into some turbulence air,

11:38.800 --> 11:44.800
we're, you know, knocked over or they ended up like actually literally flying through the cabin

11:44.800 --> 11:46.800
and getting really badly hurt.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.800
Yeah, yeah.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.800
Everyone, you've got to fasten your seat belt.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.800
Yes, remain seated.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.800
Yeah.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.800
