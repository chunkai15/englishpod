00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to English Pod, my name is Marco.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
And I'm Erica.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
And today we have an elementary lesson for you and we are at the supermarket.

00:10.000 --> 00:19.000
That's right. We're at the grocery store and we're going to learn some language you can use when you want to pay for your groceries.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
So this lesson was requested by one of our users that wanted vocabulary and different phrases that are used in the supermarket

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
when the person is about to pay for all the things they need.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
The trait and we also have some great language that the person who is actually selling the groceries can use.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Alright, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and see what happens.

00:46.000 --> 00:58.000
Excuse me sir, this is the express check out the name for people who have 15 items or fewer.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh come on, I have 16 items, cut me some slack, will ya?

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Fine. Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping card through.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Plastic.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I also have a couple of coupons.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
No problem, I'll take those.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Turn.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh well, I guess it's just not my day.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Thanks anyway.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Give a club card or will it be cash?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Yeah, I got a club card. Here you go.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Will this be debit or credit?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
debit, please.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Also, can I get cash back?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
$50 would be great.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, sure.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Your total is $78.33.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Here's your seat, have a nice day.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Well, we can see in this dialogue that the guy was able to buy his food.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
And you know, they were using some really interesting, helpful language.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
That's right.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
And so why don't we look at this language now in language takeaway?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Language takeaway.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Okay, we have six words for you today.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
And the first one, the girl, the cashier, says,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
this is the Express checkout lane.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
All right, so check out lane.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
The checkout lane.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
So the checkout lane is the place where you get in line

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
to pay for all the goods you bought.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Right.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
So the checkout lane.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
No, why did she say Express checkout lane?

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
So in grocery stores or in supermarkets, sometimes you have a specific checkout lane

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
that's faster.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Okay, because people have less things.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
So Express is the faster checkout lane.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Right, the faster one.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
All right, so next, she tells the guy to put your items on the belt.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Okay, the belt.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Now we know belt as the thing you put around your waist to keep your pants up.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Right.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
But in a supermarket, the belt is the moving table that you put your groceries on.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
So the cashier starts to pass them through.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Okay, so the belt.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Okay, the belt.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So your groceries on the belt.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
And then the guy said that he had a couple of coupons.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
coupons.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
coupons.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay, so what is a coupon?

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
A coupon is a piece of paper you can use to get a discount.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
All right, so it has a discount on it.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
A discount for one thing.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Okay.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
So maybe you buy some some apples and you get 10% off one kind of apple.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Very good coupons.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Now he presented these coupons and she said they were expired.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
The coupons expired yesterday expired.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
To expire.

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
All right, so to expire, that means to be older than the date when you can use them.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Right, so why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use expired.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
So we can understand a little bit better.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Example one.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm sorry, sir.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
This credit card expired five years ago.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
You can't use it anymore.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Example two.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
My driver's license expired in a month.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
So I have to get it renewed.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Example three.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Don't drink that.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
The milk has expired.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Okay, so we can see his coupons expired.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
So they were too old and he couldn't use them anymore.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Exactly.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
And now finally, she asked him if he wants to pay with his club card or cash.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So club card.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Club card.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
What's a club card?

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
So in some supermarkets, you can receive a special type of credit card.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
You can only use for grocery shopping.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
And only in that store.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Right.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
So that is a club card.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
All right, so a club card.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Okay, so he's going to pay with a card.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
But he also asked for some cash back.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Cash back.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Could I get cash back?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Now, what what's he talking about?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Can he get cash back?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
He's paying with a card.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
What does he want to do?

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, what happens is sometimes suppose your grocery is cost.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
20 dollars.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Okay.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
So instead of charging 20 dollars to your credit card or your club card.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
You say, okay, put 70 dollars.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
So then the cashier can give you 50 dollars back.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
So you can have cash in your pocket.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Ah, so instead of going to the ATM, you can get your money in one spot.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Exactly.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
All right.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Cash back.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Interesting.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Well, why don't we hear this one more time in the dialogue.

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
But let's slow it down a little so we can understand better.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Excuse me, sir.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
This is the express checkout lane for people that have 15 items or fewer.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Oh, come on.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I have 16 items.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Cut me some slack.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Will ya?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Fine.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Plastic.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I also have a couple of coupons.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
No problem.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I'll take those.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Oh, well, I guess it's just not my day.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Thanks anyway.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah, I got a club card.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Here you go.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Will this be debit or credit?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
debit, please.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Also, can I get cash back?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
$50 would be great.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah, sure.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Your total is $78.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
$33.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Here's your receipt.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Have a nice day.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Thank you.

07:26.000 --> 07:38.000
Alright, so now that we've listened to the dialogue for the second time, it's time for us to take a look at some phrases in fluency builder.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Fluency builder.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Okay, we have three phrases for you now.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Well, the guy was not having a very good day was he.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
Like he couldn't go in the express check-out lane and he says, cut me some slack.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Cut me some slack.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
To cut someone some slack.

07:57.000 --> 08:06.000
Alright, now this is an interesting and very informal phrase, so before we explain it, why don't we listen to a couple of other examples?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Example one.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Cut me some slack.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I'm only two minutes late.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Example two.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
My wife just had a baby and I'm so tired.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Cut me some slack.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
I'll send you the report tomorrow.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Example three.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Emily had a really bad week.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
I think you should cut her some slack.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
Okay, I think I can understand it means relax the rules a little bit.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Right, so don't be so strict on me.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, don't be so hard.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
Now, I know this phrase actually comes from mountain climbing.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh, because of the rope.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
Yeah, so it's just it's like saying the slack is loose rope.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
So he's just saying give me a little bit more freedom.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Give me more freedom.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
It's interesting.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
To cut somebody some slack.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Well, now the cashier asked him a question.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
She says, do you prefer paper or plastic?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Paper or plastic?

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
Now, this is the common cliche of phrase that any grocery store cashier will use, right?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, so paper or plastic, what?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Bags, paper or plastic bags.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
All right, so you'll hear this all the time in every grocery store.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Do you want paper or plastic?

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Right, so you can choose plastic bags or paper bags.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
Okay, remember this one because when you get it right, you'll sound really native like.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Very good.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
And our last phrase, since he wasn't really having a good day,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
he said, it's just not my day.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
It's just not my day.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It's not my day.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
Okay, so when it's not your day, it means the day has been hard.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
You've not really lucky.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah, it's not, it's not a good day for you.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Not a good day.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit about grocery stores in America.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Excuse me, sir.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
This is the express checkout lane for people who have 15 items or fewer.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Oh, come on.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I have 16 items.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Cut me some slack, will ya?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Fine.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping card through.

10:31.000 --> 10:42.000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Plastic.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I also have a couple of coupons.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
No problem, I'll take those.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Torne.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh well, I guess it's just not my day.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Thanks anyway.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Give a club card or will it be cash?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah, I got a club card.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Here you go.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Will this be debit or credit?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
debit, please.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Also, can I get cash back?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
$50 would be great.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, sure.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Your total is $78.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
And 33 cents.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Here's your seat.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Have a nice day.

11:19.000 --> 11:32.400
Well, one interesting thing I know about grocery stores in America is that the people who are

11:32.400 --> 11:35.000
the cashiers are very often students.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
Right, it's a very popular summer job or part-time job, like college students.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah, or even in my hometown, it was the most common job for high school students.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
After school, if you went to the grocery store between 4 o'clock and 9 o'clock at night, every single

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
cashier would be a high school student.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
And the interesting thing is that the cashiers are usually women, right?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah, I'll always the high school girls were the cashiers.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
And so the high school boys would be working in the back, maybe in the warehouse, carrying

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
boxes or stocking the shelves.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
So putting the cans on the shelves, right?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Exactly.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
It's a very popular part-time job for students in the United States.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
But also coupons are very popular in America.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah, what is it about coupons?

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
Well, usually, for example, in the Sunday newspaper, you will receive a lot of coupons.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Okay.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
You go to the grocery store and you have all these coupons for cookies or promotion on some type of

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
soda or drink.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
So it's very popular.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
People go grocery shopping and then present all these coupons.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
And actually, you can end up saving a good amount of money.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
And the coupons are usually like, save two cents or save 25 cents.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
But I guess if you put all of those together, you can save money.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
It's interesting because people actually will buy that product just because they have a coupon.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
coupons and high school checkout girls.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
