Hello English learners, welcome back to English,

00:04.780 --> 00:12.380
part of my name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we have another romantic lesson kind

00:12.380 --> 00:18.660
of romantic a little romantic we got a boyfriend and a girlfriend and they're apologizing

00:18.660 --> 00:23.600
to each other okay so it's a very common situation and we're going to be talking about

00:23.600 --> 00:28.900
love we're also going to talk about different pet names that are commonly used in English

00:28.940 --> 00:35.500
that are used with your boyfriend or girlfriend okay very good so let's listen to this

00:35.500 --> 00:39.460
dialogue for the first time and see what's happening with her couple

00:39.460 --> 01:07.780
you know what I mean yeah I know I want to know where this relationship is going

01:08.100 --> 01:14.660
I mean love with you and I need to know you know I think you're awesome I'm awesome

01:15.620 --> 01:22.740
well I guess that's my answer isn't it honey look if you don't love me it's not a thing all right

01:22.740 --> 01:28.980
we've had our laughs but I don't appreciate well maybe it's just time we baby I love you so much

01:28.980 --> 01:36.900
you do I love you and I think you're awesome oh I love you too come on put the gun down oh baby

01:36.980 --> 01:49.460
I'm so sorry okay so romantic and dramatic yeah I think she really needed to hear that right so

01:49.460 --> 01:55.940
I think she really wanted to hear I love you yeah that's right and there's some interesting phrases

01:55.940 --> 02:01.620
here in this in this dialogue and today we're going to focus mostly on phrases so why don't

02:01.700 --> 02:09.940
we start with fluency builder fluency builder okay on fluency builder today we're going to take a look

02:09.940 --> 02:16.100
at some of these phrases and the first one is very important and very different so obviously this

02:16.100 --> 02:23.140
dialogue is about love and we heard two different ways that this word is used and the first one is

02:23.140 --> 02:30.820
to love someone right so he said I love you yeah I love you we all pretty much understand what that means

02:31.300 --> 02:39.220
but they also mentioned to be in love with someone okay so he said I am in love with you

02:39.220 --> 02:46.100
I'm in love with you in love okay so what's the difference between two love and to be in love

02:46.100 --> 02:52.660
to be in love with someone means that you have these strong romantic feelings towards somebody

02:52.660 --> 03:00.420
that's right so you can only be in love with your boyfriend your girlfriend your husband or your wife

03:00.500 --> 03:05.300
so you can love your parents you can love your family but you can be in love with them you can

03:05.300 --> 03:12.340
only be in love with your girlfriend boyfriend husband wife that's right okay so moving on to the next

03:12.340 --> 03:20.900
phrase now the girl asked her boyfriend can we talk can we talk can we talk this is a very simple

03:20.900 --> 03:27.700
sentence right we know the meaning right but why does she say can we talk okay so you use this

03:27.700 --> 03:34.980
when you want to start a conversation about something serious okay so if you wanted to talk to me

03:34.980 --> 03:41.780
about my new shirt I wouldn't ask I wouldn't say hey Marco can we talk oh I really like your

03:41.780 --> 03:48.980
shirt where'd you get it exactly right that it has to be serious so usually if somebody says hey

03:48.980 --> 03:54.260
can we talk it means that there's going to be a serious topic it's going to be probably bad news maybe

03:54.260 --> 04:00.020
that yes yeah so can we talk so if your boyfriend or girlfriend tells you this well it's not a good

04:00.020 --> 04:06.420
sign that's right all right and the last phrase that we have on fluency builder you know what I mean

04:06.420 --> 04:12.660
you know what I mean you know what I mean you know what I mean all right so again this phrase is

04:12.660 --> 04:18.980
very simple to understand right that's right so you know what I'm talking about you you understand

04:19.940 --> 04:27.300
but the interesting thing is that we can also make it a question and it's all about the change

04:27.300 --> 04:35.060
in tone okay so with this in mind let's listen to two examples of the same phrase but with different

04:35.060 --> 04:45.540
tones and you try to see which one is the question example one I'm tired of doing nothing all day

04:45.540 --> 04:54.980
here at home you know what I mean example two come on Charles you know what I mean when I say

04:54.980 --> 05:04.580
that I don't like your friends example three I hate this class it's so boring and tedious you know

05:04.580 --> 05:12.740
what I mean all right so we heard the examples and well maybe you guessed it right the second

05:12.820 --> 05:17.780
example was the question that's right you know what I mean right so basically you're asking the

05:17.780 --> 05:22.980
person if they understand your idea or they understand what you're talking about so maybe you can say

05:22.980 --> 05:27.780
so the professor wasn't very clear on his instructions so how was I supposed to do the homework you know

05:27.780 --> 05:33.540
what I mean so you're asking me to confirm that I understand you my idea you understand what I'm saying yeah

05:33.540 --> 05:39.140
okay and if it was a statement I might say hey I don't like going to your mom's house

05:39.140 --> 05:44.740
so I would say what what do you mean why you know what I mean right so I perfectly understand or

05:44.740 --> 05:49.380
know the reasons why you don't like going yeah like I don't have to tell you you know what I mean

05:49.380 --> 05:54.980
all right very good so you know what I mean great so we've taken a look at these four phrases they're

05:54.980 --> 06:01.140
very simple but the way that you use them gives them different meanings that's right all right so

06:01.140 --> 06:05.940
let's listen to our dialogue for the second time let's slow it down a little bit and then we'll

06:06.020 --> 06:18.100
come back and look at some more phrases can we talk sure honey we're talking now aren't we

06:18.820 --> 06:26.740
you know what I mean yeah I know I want to know where this relationship is going I mean love with you

06:26.740 --> 06:35.220
and I need to know you know I think you're awesome I'm awesome well I guess that's my answer isn't it honey

06:36.100 --> 06:42.180
look if you don't love me it's not a thing all right we've had our laughs but I don't appreciate

06:42.180 --> 06:49.620
well maybe it's just time we baby I love you so much you do I love you and I think you're awesome

06:49.620 --> 07:02.100
oh I love you too come on put the gun down oh baby I'm so sorry okay so now it's time for us to

07:02.100 --> 07:06.420
take a look at some more phrases but this time we're gonna look at them and putting it together

07:08.420 --> 07:14.420
let's get together okay we're gonna see how we can use these phrases in a few different

07:14.420 --> 07:21.700
situations so the girl wanted to talk to her boyfriend because she wanted to know where this relationship

07:21.700 --> 07:29.300
is going right where is this relationship going where is this relationship going so she wants to know

07:29.380 --> 07:33.700
what's going to happen or what's the future what's the future of this relationship are we gonna

07:33.700 --> 07:38.660
get married or just what what's happening yeah so why don't we listen to some examples with different

07:38.660 --> 07:46.180
nouns and how we can use this phrase example one I don't know where my career is going in this

07:46.180 --> 07:51.060
company I don't see any potential for growth example two

07:53.380 --> 07:56.660
this movie is so confusing I have no idea where the plot is going

07:57.620 --> 08:06.260
example three we have been in this meeting for over two hours and I still don't know where it's

08:06.260 --> 08:13.860
going okay so again this phrase is just asking about the future of something right so where the

08:13.860 --> 08:18.980
future of this movie where is this movie going yeah what's happening right what's going to happen

08:18.980 --> 08:25.220
yeah or your career etc yeah okay and so the girl you know she was talking a little bit about

08:25.300 --> 08:34.260
her feelings and she said maybe it's just time we okay so this phrase isn't complete yet

08:34.260 --> 08:40.100
we need to finish it yeah but she is basically saying maybe we should do this how can we finish the phrase

08:40.100 --> 08:46.100
all right so so she could say maybe it's just time we break up all right or I can say

08:46.100 --> 08:55.460
maybe it's time we have a baby oh my god all right even maybe it's time we go home okay so

08:55.460 --> 09:00.500
it's getting late let's go home maybe it's time we go home yeah so this is how we can finish this

09:00.500 --> 09:08.020
phrase and what about our last phrase she also said we've had our laughs okay so that means

09:08.020 --> 09:15.620
we've had our good times yeah okay but we can change this too we've had our ups and downs okay

09:15.620 --> 09:21.700
or we've had our moments right so that means we've had our good moments in our bad moments

09:21.700 --> 09:28.180
that's right or we've had our issues okay so that means we've had some problems we've had some

09:28.180 --> 09:35.780
difficulties or even we've had our moments okay so that means we've had it so that means we've had

09:35.780 --> 09:41.060
our special times special occasions that we will always remember that's right okay so a really

09:41.060 --> 09:48.060
So three really useful structures that you can change the words a little bit to slightly change the meaning.

09:48.060 --> 09:52.060
Okay, so it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time.

09:52.060 --> 09:54.060
Now we're ready to understand everything.

09:54.060 --> 09:59.060
And then we'll come back and give you some examples of pet names in English.

10:11.060 --> 10:17.060
Can we talk?

10:17.060 --> 10:18.060
Sure, honey.

10:18.060 --> 10:20.060
We're talking now, aren't we?

10:20.060 --> 10:21.060
You know what I mean.

10:21.060 --> 10:23.060
Yeah, I know.

10:23.060 --> 10:26.060
I want to know where this relationship is going.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.060
I mean, love with you.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.060
And I need to know.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.060
You know, I think you're awesome.

10:32.060 --> 10:34.060
I'm awesome.

10:34.060 --> 10:36.060
Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

10:36.060 --> 10:37.060
Honey.

10:37.060 --> 10:39.060
Look, if you don't love me,

10:39.060 --> 10:41.060
it's not a thing, all right?

10:41.060 --> 10:43.060
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.060
Well, maybe it's just time we...

10:45.060 --> 10:47.060
Baby, I love you so much.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.060
You do?

10:48.060 --> 10:49.060
I love you.

10:49.060 --> 10:51.060
And I think you're awesome.

10:51.060 --> 10:53.060
Oh, I love you too.

10:53.060 --> 10:54.060
Come on.

10:54.060 --> 10:55.060
Put the gun down.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.060
Oh, baby.

10:56.060 --> 10:58.060
I'm so sorry.

10:58.060 --> 11:07.060
All right, Omar, could you mention this word pet names?

11:07.060 --> 11:09.060
And what exactly is that?

11:09.060 --> 11:12.060
All right, so pet names aren't names for your dogs or your cats, right?

11:12.060 --> 11:13.060
Okay, right.

11:13.060 --> 11:16.060
They are those sweet names that you would call your boyfriend or girlfriend.

11:16.060 --> 11:18.060
Okay, so like, baby.

11:18.060 --> 11:20.060
Okay, in our dialogue, we heard baby.

11:20.060 --> 11:21.060
Yep, right?

11:21.060 --> 11:24.060
So we're not talking about a little child now.

11:24.060 --> 11:27.060
This is usually how you would call maybe your girlfriend or boyfriend.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.060
Or honey.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.060
Honey, right?

11:29.060 --> 11:31.060
Hey, honey, or honey, I'm home.

11:31.060 --> 11:32.060
Yeah.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.060
Right?

11:33.060 --> 11:35.060
But we also have other ones like sweetheart.

11:35.060 --> 11:36.060
Mm-hmm.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.060
For darling.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.060
Darling.

11:38.060 --> 11:39.060
Yeah.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.060
Or what about sweetie?

11:40.060 --> 11:41.060
Mm-hmm.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.060
Or cutie.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.060
Cutie.

11:43.060 --> 11:46.060
So some of these phrases can be a little bit like cheesy, maybe.

11:46.060 --> 11:48.060
Well, yeah, a little too too much.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.060
Yeah.

11:49.060 --> 11:50.060
Smuckums.

11:50.060 --> 11:51.060
Snuckums.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.060
Snuckums.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.060
Like snuckums.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.060
Okay.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.060
Or honey bunny.

11:55.060 --> 11:56.060
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:57.060 --> 11:58.060
You also have sweetie pie.

11:58.060 --> 11:59.060
Yep.

11:59.060 --> 12:00.060
Yeah.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.060
And some of them will make some up, right?

12:01.060 --> 12:05.060
Maybe they'll call their boyfriend, um, poo bear.

12:05.060 --> 12:06.060
Oh, yeah.

12:06.060 --> 12:07.060
Right?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.060
Yeah.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.060
Like, you know, like, we need a poo bear.

12:09.060 --> 12:10.060
Yeah.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.060
I heard dumpling.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.060
Yeah.

12:12.060 --> 12:15.060
Also, it could be, you can make up your own for it.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.060
You can make up your own pet names, right?

12:17.060 --> 12:18.060
Yeah.

12:18.060 --> 12:19.060
So I want to hear from our listeners.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.060
Are there any common pet names in your language?

12:21.060 --> 12:25.060
I know that in Spanish, we sometimes call the, we, we can sometimes call

12:25.060 --> 12:30.060
our girlfriend, Gorda, which actually means fat.

12:30.060 --> 12:32.060
But it's not in a bad way.

12:32.060 --> 12:33.060
Really?

12:33.060 --> 12:35.060
It's a sweet way of calling your, your girlfriend.

12:35.060 --> 12:38.060
And I know in French, you can say, my poo switch,

12:38.060 --> 12:40.060
basically means my flee.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.060
Yeah.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.060
So some of them, if you translate, you wouldn't really use an English,

12:44.060 --> 12:48.060
but let us know translate from your language or other ones that you've heard

12:48.060 --> 12:52.060
maybe in movies or talk shows and come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

12:52.060 --> 12:53.060
Yeah.

12:53.060 --> 12:56.060
Leave your questions there, as well as your pet names.

12:56.060 --> 12:59.060
And Marco and I are always happy to see you there.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.060
Okay, until next time.

13:00.060 --> 13:01.060
Goodbye.

13:01.060 --> 13:02.060
Bye.
