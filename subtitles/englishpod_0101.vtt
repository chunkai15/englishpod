00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another edition here with us at EnglishPod.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
My name is Marco.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
And I'm Erica.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
And today we are doing the third part of our old English series.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
And today we're transported back to the 1970s.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
That's right.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
So we're going to learn some 1970s slang.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Some phrases that were really popular back in the 70s,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
but are also still in use today.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Exactly. So it's going to be a very cool lesson today.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
And before we start with the dialogue,

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
let's take a look at some of the words that we're going to find in vocabulary preview.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Well, we have two words for you in vocabulary preview,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
and they're both found in the dialogue.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
The first one, roller rink.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
A roller rink.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
A roller rink.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Okay. So a roller rink.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Let's break that down and let's look at the first part.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
So roller.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
We might recognize this from roller blades or roller skates.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Okay. So yeah, when you go roller blade in roller skating,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
those things that you put on your feet to skate.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Right. Wheels not like a blade or a knife.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Exactly. So that's roller.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
And what about rink?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Rink is the place where you do skating.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay. So if you go to a roller rink,

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
it's this big area where everyone can roller blade or roller skate.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
That's right.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Okay. And what about the next word?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
A block.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay. So this is a noun, a block.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
And a block is a part of a city that is surrounded by four streets.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Okay. So a city is made up of many blocks.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yep.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
And everyone lives on a block.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Exactly. So it's a square within the city.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
All right. Very good.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
So these are the two words that we previewed.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
And we're going to listen to them now in the dialogue.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
We're going to hear two guys just talking about normal everyday things.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
But we're going to be listening to them in 1997.

01:54.000 --> 02:06.000
Hey, man. How's it hanging?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Hey, man.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Hey, man.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Everything is just groovy, baby.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Did you cut the roller rink on Saturday?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I heard it was far out, man.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I wanted to, but I ran into this.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Fuck.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
See, lady, that just moved to my block.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
I was chatting her up a bit.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And then we milled out at her plate.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Right on, right on.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
And he said it was done.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
No, man.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Gravy.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
He's always hitting me up for cash.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah, man. I'm starving.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Okay, groovy dialogue.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, really nice, huh?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
All right. So some interesting language in here.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Like I said, it sounds a bit strange,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
but a lot of this is still used today in modern English.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
So why don't we look at some of these words in language takeaway?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Language takeaway.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
All right. On language takeaway today,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
we have the first word far out.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Far out.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
That was far out.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
To be far out.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Okay. So it's just another way of saying cool.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Cool. That was nice.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
It was really cool.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
So they went to the roller rink.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
It was far out.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It was really cool.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
But the other guy couldn't go because he saw a Foxy lady.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
A Foxy lady.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Okay. Foxy lady.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
So basically a Foxy lady is a really good looking or sexy woman.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Right. Come in.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
You would hear some men refer to a attractive woman as a fox.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Okay. So Foxy lady.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Now, Marco, can we say a Foxy man?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
No. This is a phrase that you would only use for women.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Okay. So Foxy lady.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Foxy lady.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
So after he met up with the Foxy lady,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
they both just decided to mellow out at her place.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
To mellow out.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
To mellow out.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Okay. So mellow out.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
What does this mean exactly?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Basically just to relax.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Right. So to relax to take it easy.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
To mellow out.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So what did you do on the weekend?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Oh, nothing. I just stayed at home and mellowed out.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Okay.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Right. And so the response to that was...

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Right on.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Right on.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Right on.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Right on. Right on.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And so basically they're saying,

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Okay. Good.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I agree.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah. This phrase you can say is good.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah. That's nice.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Or you can also say it as well.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Correct.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Correct. I agree.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use this word in other situations?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Example one.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Right on. You got a high score. That's amazing.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Example two.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
You got the job. Right on.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Example three.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Jenny was right when she told me she thought Rick was no good for me.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I should have listened to her.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Okay. So I think that's pretty clear.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
We can see how it means correct.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Or also, okay.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Good.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
All right. Right on.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
And now we also have another word that's similar to far out.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
He said gravy gravy gravy.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Now if you look it up in a dictionary,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
it's going to tell you something else.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Right. gravy is a sauce you put on meat.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Right. But in this case, we say gravy is cool.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
It's nice.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yep. Right. So gravy.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
That was gravy.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Mm-hmm.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Now finally at the end of their conversation,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
they said one a book.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Okay. Let's book.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Book.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
So two book.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
It's a verb.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Interesting verb.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It basically means to leave a place quickly.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Okay. So we have to book the police are coming.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Right.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Or I got a book, guys.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
I'm late.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
So book.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
To leave quickly to leave suddenly.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Yep. And that word is used quite commonly today, isn't it?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah. Yeah.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It's used among like younger people.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
You would say, yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Let's book this party is dead.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Okay. Great.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
So there's a lot of pretty cool phrases in this dialogue.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Pretty groovy phrases.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Why don't we hear them again in context?

06:09.000 --> 06:20.000
Hey, man. How's it hanging?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Hey.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Everything is just groovy, baby.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I heard it was far out, man.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
I wanted to, but I ran into this fox lady

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
that just moved to my block.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I was chatting her up a bit.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
And then we mallowed out at her place.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Right on, right on.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And he said it was done no matter.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Gravy.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Jim is such a giant turkey, man.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
He's always hitting me up for cash.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Anyway, you want a book and go grab some grub?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, man. I'm starving.

07:09.000 --> 07:17.000
Alright, so now that we understand these six words that we saw in language takeaway,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
it's time for us now to take a look at some great phrases

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
that we can use today in fluency builder.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Fluency builder.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Okay, so at the start of the conversation,

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
there was an interesting way he started talking to his friend, right?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Alright, he said, how's it hanging?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
How's it hanging?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Okay, so basically, how is it going?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
How's it going? How are you?

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Now, you notice in the spelling that we do have a G at the end,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I and G, right?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Yeah, but usually you don't really pronounce the G in this context,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
because it's very informal.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
So, how's it hanging?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
How's it hanging?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
So he said everything was just groovy,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
and then he started telling him about how he met a girl

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
and he chatted her up a bit.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
To chat her up.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Okay, so to chat somebody up.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
So when you chat someone up, you talk with them, right?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Yeah, you're making conversation.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
But it's more than just conversation, isn't it?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah, you're trying to be a little bit flirty,

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
and maybe say nice romantic phrases or something like that.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah, so usually it's between a woman and a man, right?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And it's the man who chats up a woman.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, exactly.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
So a little bit of a sexist phrase here.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
To chat someone up or to chat up a girl, right?

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Okay, so he was chatting her up.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
That's right.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And so they were talking about how Jim went to the roller rink.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
But he didn't have any money, right?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Because Jim is always hitting his friends up for cash.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Okay, so to hit someone up.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
To hit someone up.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
So before we explain this word,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
let's listen to some other examples,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
and then we can maybe understand the meaning.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Example one.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Can you believe Patrick?

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
He came up to me a month ago and tried to hit me up for some money.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Example two.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
When I was a kid, I used to always hit my dad up for lunch money.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Example three.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
This is the last time I lend you money.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Don't even try to hit me up for more.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
All right, so when you hit someone up for something, you ask for it.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
So usually it's to ask for money, right?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
That's right.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Okay, so to hit someone up and now for our last phrase,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
let's book and it's go grab some grub.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
To grab some grub.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Grab some grub.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Okay, let's break this one down.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
With the final word, grub, what are we talking about?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Grub is an informal way of saying food.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Okay, so to grab some grub is to get some food quickly.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, let's go get some food.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
All right, so maybe it's time for us to grab some grub.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
And while we're doing that, you can listen to the dialogue one last time.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Hey, man, how's it hanging?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Hey, man.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Hey, man.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Everything is just groovy, baby.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Did you cut the roller in concert today?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I heard it was far out, man.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
I wanted to, but I ran into this boxy lady that just moved to my block.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
I was chatting her up a bit, and then we milled out at her plate.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Right on, right on.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Well, Jim went to the Rinkway Sherry, and he said it was done.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
No, my it's.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Gravy.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
He's always hitting me up for cash.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Anyway, you want a book and go grab some grub?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah, man. I'm starving.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Alright, so some interesting phrases, and even though some of these words,

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
you may not really commonly hear anymore, they might still be using movies

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
or something that's related to the disco era, because it's very, very popular still, right?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah, that's right.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Some of our more advanced users could even use a lot of these

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
phrases in a kind of funny way to reference back to 1970.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah, exactly.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
So it's fun, and well, you will use them, or you will hear them from time to time, even today.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
