00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
Hello English learners, welcome back to another advanced lesson with us here at English

00:07.760 --> 00:08.760
Pod.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.760
My name is Marco.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.760
And my name is Erica.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.120
So today we're bringing you another advanced lesson and this time it's kind of historical.

00:15.120 --> 00:20.840
Like the name suggests, we are listening in as a president says goodbye to the nation

00:20.840 --> 00:23.600
before he steps down from his role as president.

00:23.680 --> 00:30.400
Now actually this dialogue is very much based on president Eisenhower's farewell speech.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.600
Okay, so pretty, pretty famous.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.600
Now we have to tell you that we did change the speech a little bit, right?

00:35.600 --> 00:40.400
I just a little bit to make it a little bit more understandable, but it's basically what

00:40.400 --> 00:43.040
he said to the nation back in 1969.

00:43.040 --> 00:49.240
All right, now I will as well tell you that this is a pretty hard dialogue.

00:49.240 --> 00:54.720
It is very hard because the structures are a little bit complicated and even to a certain

00:54.720 --> 00:57.400
point, a little bit poetic, right?

00:57.400 --> 01:01.600
So why are we taking this speech as our dialogue, what are we going to learn from this?

01:01.600 --> 01:06.000
Well we're going to learn some structures and some words that you can use maybe on a

01:06.000 --> 01:11.240
resignation letter or maybe in a celebration you want to thank Pete for coming.

01:11.240 --> 01:16.240
Okay, so we're going to learn some pretty difficult vocabulary, but also learn some really

01:16.320 --> 01:20.600
useful structures like you said you could use in a resignation letter or even in a formal

01:20.600 --> 01:21.880
speech of your own.

01:21.880 --> 01:22.880
Exactly.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.760
Now this presidential farewell speech is divided into two parts.

01:26.760 --> 01:31.760
So today we're going to do part one and then next time we'll finish the speech with

01:31.760 --> 01:32.760
part two.

01:32.760 --> 01:38.320
So let's listen to President Eisenhower as he says goodbye to the nation and we'll come

01:38.320 --> 01:39.600
back just in a little bit.

01:46.320 --> 01:52.240
My fellow Americans, three days from now after a century of service to our country, I should

01:52.240 --> 01:57.640
lay down the responsibilities of office as in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority

01:57.640 --> 02:01.080
of the presidency is vested in my successor.

02:01.080 --> 02:05.600
This evening I come to you with a message of leave taking and farewell and to share a few

02:05.600 --> 02:10.360
final thoughts with you, my countrymen.

02:10.360 --> 02:15.120
Like every other citizen, I wish the new president and all who will labor with him, God's

02:15.120 --> 02:16.120
speed.

02:16.120 --> 02:22.680
I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.

02:22.680 --> 02:27.320
Our people expect their president and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions

02:27.320 --> 02:31.760
of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our

02:31.760 --> 02:34.040
great nation.

02:34.040 --> 02:40.040
My own relations with Congress begin on a remote and continuous basis when Lona Go, a member

02:40.040 --> 02:43.040
of the Senate, have pointed me to West Point.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.800
I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationships with Congress during

02:46.800 --> 02:52.160
the war and the immediate post-war period, finally we have progressed to the mutually

02:52.160 --> 03:00.760
interdependent relationship we've had during these past eight years.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.120
Wow, so Eisenhower is a pretty good speaker, isn't he?

03:04.120 --> 03:08.200
A good speaker and well, he said a lot of really nice things when he was saying goodbye.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.400
Yeah, pretty inspiring, I thought.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.400
Really inspiring.

03:11.400 --> 03:16.720
And as we said, there were a couple of different and difficult words and phrases, so why

03:16.720 --> 03:21.280
don't we start right now with language takeaway?

03:21.280 --> 03:22.560
Language takeaway?

03:22.560 --> 03:30.200
Well, Eisenhower said that in three days he shall lay down the responsibilities.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.640
To lay down the responsibilities.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.280
All right, lay down something.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.840
Basically, we understand the verb to lay down.

03:38.840 --> 03:39.840
Yeah.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.880
So, to put it on the ground.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.880
Right.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.840
Now, he's using it with responsibilities, which is a little bit strange, but it's kind

03:46.840 --> 03:51.600
of like a metaphor by saying, lay down arms to lay down your weapons.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.600
Right.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
And you know what?

03:53.600 --> 03:56.640
This is a really common phrase that we would hear, especially when we're talking

03:56.640 --> 04:01.480
about the end of a war or something like that, to lay down your arms down your weapons.

04:01.480 --> 04:06.040
Yeah, so here, I think Eisenhower is kind of referencing this and giving us a little

04:06.040 --> 04:09.360
bit of poetry in his speech.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.920
So it's not that he's quitting, it's not that he's being fired, he's just like finishing

04:13.920 --> 04:14.920
what he started.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.920
Yeah.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.600
So he's laying down his responsibilities.

04:17.600 --> 04:22.120
Now, I think this would be quite an interesting phrase to use, for example, in a resignation

04:22.120 --> 04:23.120
letter.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.120
Right.

04:24.120 --> 04:28.720
So, I would say a month from now, I will lay down my responsibilities as manager.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
Yep.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
All right.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
So that sounds pretty good.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.080
Now, he said he's going to be laying down the responsibilities in a traditional

04:35.080 --> 04:37.080
and solemn ceremony.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.080
All right.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.080
Well, solemn.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.080
Now, solemn.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.080
What does that mean?

04:41.080 --> 04:43.080
What does a solemn ceremony?

04:43.080 --> 04:50.560
Well, a solemn ceremony would be a serious, respectful, and a little bit sad ceremony.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.560
Okay.

04:51.560 --> 04:55.520
So, it's a serious matter, it's, and it's very respectful.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.520
Yeah.

04:56.520 --> 05:01.920
So you might, you might say, for example, on the 11th of November, when you're remembering

05:01.920 --> 05:05.560
the war, you might say something like, this is a very solemn day.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.560
Very good.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.920
Okay.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.800
And the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.800
Okay.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.200
So, interesting verb.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.200
No.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.640
So, interesting word, vested, vested.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.640
The authority vested in my successor.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.640
Very good.

05:22.640 --> 05:26.800
So, this word basically means power that I have by law.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.800
Right.

05:27.800 --> 05:33.200
So, this power, this important power you have is given to you by the law, by the present,

05:33.200 --> 05:34.560
by the country.

05:34.560 --> 05:39.040
This is a very common word you will hear in a wedding, when the priest or the person

05:39.040 --> 05:45.480
that's leading the wedding will say, by the power vested in me by the state of California.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
Yep.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.480
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.480
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.480
Yeah.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.160
So, you're saying the power that I have given to me by the state of California,

05:52.160 --> 05:54.920
I can now make you be married.

05:54.920 --> 06:00.120
So, here, Eisenhower is saying, the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor.

06:00.200 --> 06:08.320
So, the power of the presidency will be given to his, given to the next president by law.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.320
Exactly.

06:09.320 --> 06:15.440
And he also wished the new president and everyone with him, he said, Godspeed.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.440
All right.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.440
Godspeed.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.440
Godspeed.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.080
I wish you Godspeed.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.080
Now, Godspeed.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
What does that mean?

06:23.080 --> 06:25.080
Well, it's kind of a blessing.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.360
You know, it basically means good luck and good fortune.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.280
All right.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.640
And especially in a journey.

06:31.640 --> 06:32.000
Yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.200
I think you'd almost only use this when someone's going off on a big trip or a journey.

06:36.200 --> 06:40.080
So, here, they're going on the journey of the presidency.

06:40.080 --> 06:40.920
Right.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.600
So, wish you Godspeed.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.960
Godspeed.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.040
Very good.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.280
And now, let's take a look at our last set of words.

06:48.280 --> 06:54.640
When he was talking about Congress, he said that his relation with Congress began on a remote

06:54.640 --> 06:56.960
and tenuous bases.

06:56.960 --> 06:57.800
All right.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.560
Interesting words here, remote and tenuous.

07:00.560 --> 07:04.240
Now, remote, we understand as being far away or distant.

07:04.240 --> 07:04.760
Yeah.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.600
What about tenuous, though?

07:06.600 --> 07:10.560
But tenuous is kind of unimportant or not really relevant.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
All right.

07:11.560 --> 07:16.240
So, actually, this is a pretty high quality, useful and smart sounding word.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.200
So, I think we should hear a few more examples of how it's used.

07:20.200 --> 07:25.480
Example one, how can you say the Earth is actually getting cooler?

07:25.520 --> 07:29.160
That is a pretty tenuous argument.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.760
Example two.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.000
John believes that Elvis Presley is still alive.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.440
He's got a tenuous hold on reality.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.480
Example three.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.000
We're making ourselves seem more important than you are.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.680
The connection between our company's success and your performance is tenuous at best.

07:48.680 --> 07:49.680
All right.

07:49.680 --> 07:55.280
So, as we've said, these are some pretty difficult words that we've found in the

07:55.280 --> 08:00.480
dialogue, but now I want to go and look at some really interesting formal structures that

08:00.480 --> 08:01.640
Eisenhower used here.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.400
So, let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.400
Fluency Builder.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.400
All right.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.400
I'm Fluency Builder today.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.960
We have three phrases and we'll starting with the first one.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.800
I think it's one of the most interesting ones.

08:14.800 --> 08:20.200
He said three days from now after a half a century of service of our country, I shall

08:20.200 --> 08:23.040
lay down the responsibilities of office.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.040
All right.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.840
So, what's interesting about this?

08:25.840 --> 08:31.640
If you take a look at the structure, he's saying three days from now, which is future,

08:31.640 --> 08:32.640
future.

08:32.640 --> 08:39.360
And then he makes a reference to the past after a half century of service.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.360
Okay.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.120
So, we got future past and then again, future.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.520
I shall lay down the responsibilities.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.520
All right.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.760
So, this actually is quite a good structure.

08:48.760 --> 08:53.720
If you're giving a farewell speech or even, even I could imagine using this at a

08:53.720 --> 08:54.720
wedding.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.720
Right.

08:55.720 --> 08:56.720
How would you use it in a wedding?

08:56.720 --> 09:03.840
Why might say 12 hours for now after a long and beautiful relationship, this

09:03.840 --> 09:05.640
couple shall marry?

09:05.640 --> 09:06.640
Very good.

09:06.640 --> 09:10.040
So, you're making reference to the future and then a past event or something that's

09:10.040 --> 09:13.160
been going on for a while and then future again.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.640
Why don't we do one more example?

09:14.640 --> 09:22.120
So, for example, in resignation letter, I can say, I can say one month from now after 30

09:22.120 --> 09:25.400
years of hard work and dedication to this company.

09:25.400 --> 09:29.040
I shall lay down my responsibilities as product manager.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.040
All right.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.040
Interesting.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.680
So, we can use it and it sounds good, it sounds very professional and very poetic.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.680
Very poetic.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Yeah.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
Sounds nice.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
Yep.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.680
All right.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
So, that's one interesting structure.

09:40.680 --> 09:46.000
Now, why don't we go on to this next kind of very formal and helpful in a very formal

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
speech?

09:47.000 --> 09:52.040
Well, President Eisenhower said, this evening, I come to you,

09:52.040 --> 09:55.120
with a message of leave-taking and farewell.

09:55.120 --> 09:59.760
So, this evening, I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell.

09:59.760 --> 10:05.120
So, it's a very nice way of saying, I'm talking to you today because I am saying goodbye.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.120
Yes.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.720
So, what I really like about this phrase is the beginning part.

10:09.720 --> 10:13.520
This evening, I come to you with a message of, hmmm.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.800
So, again, let's suppose we're at a wedding.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
Uh-huh.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.520
If I'm offering a toast or I'm the best man, I could say, this evening, I come to you

10:20.520 --> 10:24.440
with a message of love and trust and respect.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.440
All right.

10:25.440 --> 10:29.160
Or, maybe if you're the leader of a company, you might say something like, this afternoon,

10:29.160 --> 10:32.280
I come to you with a message of hope for the future.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.280
Very good.

10:33.280 --> 10:38.280
And now, the part when he says leave-taking and farewell, it's basically saying, taking leave,

10:38.280 --> 10:39.880
or taking like a vacation, right?

10:39.880 --> 10:40.880
Yeah.

10:40.880 --> 10:41.880
Farewell.

10:41.880 --> 10:42.880
Goodbye.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.880
And what about our last phrase?

10:44.880 --> 10:49.240
This is actually a bit of a long one, so I'm going to read it now.

10:49.240 --> 10:55.880
Our people expect their president and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions

10:55.880 --> 11:01.920
of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our great

11:01.920 --> 11:02.920
nation.

11:02.920 --> 11:03.920
Okay.

11:03.920 --> 11:04.920
Great.

11:04.920 --> 11:05.920
Now, let's take a look at the first part.

11:05.920 --> 11:11.800
Basically, he's saying the people expect the president and the Congress to give them answers,

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
right?

11:12.800 --> 11:13.800
Well, yeah.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.160
It's to agree on important issues.

11:15.160 --> 11:20.080
And in the part when he says, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future

11:20.080 --> 11:21.080
of our great nation.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.080
Yeah.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.960
And this is the part I want to focus on, the wise resolution of which.

11:25.960 --> 11:30.640
Now, this is a really wonderful sort of a formal structure.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.840
So we can see what he's doing here.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.320
He's talking about the first idea, right?

11:35.320 --> 11:40.920
So the president and the Congress need to find agreement on important issues, right?

11:40.920 --> 11:46.800
Now, the wise resolution of which, so he's referring back to that idea.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.600
So the wise resolution of what?

11:48.600 --> 11:51.400
Of the essential agreement on questions of great importance.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
Right.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.560
So really useful structure.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.320
Why don't we hear a few more examples of this?

11:58.320 --> 12:01.800
Example one.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.880
We now face a great challenge.

12:03.880 --> 12:09.720
The overcoming of which lead us all to untold riches and success.

12:09.720 --> 12:13.000
Example two.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.040
We is a company now face our most difficult months to date.

12:16.040 --> 12:20.840
The outcome of which will determine our company's future.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.040
Example three.

12:24.040 --> 12:28.040
The ambitious plan to reduce poverty, the start of which was launched last Tuesday in

12:28.040 --> 12:33.440
New York, will require huge investment of taxpayers' dollars.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.840
All right.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.520
So as you can hear from the examples, we have the main idea.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.200
Then he passes on, but then kind of refers back to it again.

12:42.200 --> 12:46.800
Yeah, and this sounds quite formal, but also quite literary and intelligent.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.800
Yeah.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.360
It makes you sound well spoken.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.360
Mm-hmm.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.360
Very good.

12:51.360 --> 12:56.120
This was quite a difficult dialogue with some really interesting and tricky structures

12:56.120 --> 12:57.120
and words.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.560
So why don't we hear it one more time all together?

12:59.560 --> 13:08.560
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

13:08.560 --> 13:13.440
Three days from now, after a century of service to our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities

13:13.440 --> 13:19.320
of office as in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the presidency is vested

13:19.320 --> 13:21.000
in my successor.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.520
This evening I come to you with a message of leave taking and farewell, and to share a few

13:25.520 --> 13:27.800
final thoughts with you, my countrymen.

13:30.120 --> 13:34.680
Like every other citizen, I wish the new president and all who will leave or with him,

13:34.680 --> 13:35.920
Godspeed.

13:35.920 --> 13:42.600
I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.

13:42.600 --> 13:47.240
Our people expect their president and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions

13:47.240 --> 13:51.680
of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our

13:51.680 --> 13:53.880
great nation.

13:53.880 --> 13:59.640
From my own relations with Congress, begin on a remote, continuous basis, when long ago,

13:59.640 --> 14:02.920
a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.880
I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationships with Congress during the

14:06.880 --> 14:10.000
war and the immediate postwar period.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.400
Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we've had during these

14:14.400 --> 14:18.400
past eight years.

14:19.400 --> 14:26.000
All right, we're back, and here with us in the studio, we have Pete, the actor in the

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
dialogue of President Eisenhower's presidential farewell speech.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.640
He's a pretty convincing actor at that.

14:32.640 --> 14:33.640
Not quite.

14:33.640 --> 14:38.280
So, Pete is going to give us a little bit of insight about President Eisenhower.

14:38.280 --> 14:41.120
All right, so what can you tell us about President Eisenhower?

14:41.120 --> 14:44.680
Well, he started off as a general.

14:44.680 --> 14:49.040
He was an accomplished officer all through the early 20th century, and then he was the

14:49.040 --> 14:54.240
Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in World War II.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.560
So now he's most famous for D-Day.

14:56.560 --> 15:01.560
He was leading it, or he was on the battlefield, but he was, he was the organizer.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.920
He was, he was kind of like the brains behind the operation.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.560
Yeah, and I don't know if you even want to leave this in, but there's a really cool document

15:08.560 --> 15:13.120
that he wrote right before the invasion, and it said, he basically knew that we're going

15:13.120 --> 15:17.560
to go one of two ways, and he wrote down a script to read in case it failed, and he basically

15:17.560 --> 15:22.440
said, you know, I'm sorry to inform you that the invasion did not go as planned, and this

15:22.440 --> 15:24.160
is set back our war effort.

15:24.160 --> 15:27.360
And when the invasion went well, he threw that in the trash, and then one of his aides

15:27.360 --> 15:30.720
found that, and I was like, wow, this is a historical document, and they kept the

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
really.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.520
So they had the, they have the copy.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.520
Alternate history.

15:34.520 --> 15:42.600
All right, so he was an accomplished general, an amazing warrior, but what about his presidency?

15:43.160 --> 15:48.760
Well, at the beginning, probably the biggest thing he did was to wrap up the Korean War,

15:48.760 --> 15:53.400
which was a vow he made during his campaign, and then he visited Korea.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.680
Obviously, the war is still technically on, but they did a range of ceasefire.

15:57.680 --> 16:03.520
I was in how it built up the interstate highway system, which is one of the big reasons

16:03.520 --> 16:08.720
that America was able to become economically successful in the 20th century.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.120
And he did it basically, so that in case of a war, we'd have an easy way of shipping

16:12.120 --> 16:17.160
our soldiers and nukes across the country, but it worked well anyway.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.400
Yeah, it's one of these things that pays aside benefit.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.440
At least he had to sell it to the country that way.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.320
It's very likely that he didn't intend ever to use it that way, but you know, you have to

16:26.320 --> 16:29.240
have like, it's like the war on Terry, you've got to sell these things in.

16:29.240 --> 16:34.040
Well, and I guess it's had a huge impact, not only on the economy of the states, but also

16:34.040 --> 16:39.320
like the culture, and in the way that people view the car, and it's a fact on society.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.320
Definitely.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.480
So pretty influential guy, this Eisenhower.

16:42.480 --> 16:47.560
Yeah, and a very historical lesson is just a little bit of a culture, and maybe some

16:47.560 --> 16:49.760
insight on American history.

16:49.760 --> 16:54.440
It's not like we're politically active or anything, but yeah, it was some interesting

16:54.440 --> 16:58.960
information there, and also, well, he was considered to be a pretty good president.

16:58.960 --> 17:03.760
Yeah, he's really, I wouldn't say among the top five or so, but quite accomplished.

17:03.760 --> 17:08.560
Well, maybe not the greatest president we've ever seen, but he wrote a pretty good farewell

17:08.560 --> 17:11.280
speech, so I think we have that to thank him for.

17:11.280 --> 17:15.200
All right, guys, so if you have any other questions or comments, you can come to the website
