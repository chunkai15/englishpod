00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
And today we're bringing you another great lesson for all of you who are interested in shopping.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Especially those of you who are interested in shopping for a car.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
A car, exactly. So we're going to give you some great language about describing a car or characteristics of a car.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yep.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
And also some really interesting language for shopping.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Yes, especially buying something really big and expensive.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Yeah, like a car.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Yeah.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
So before we listen to our dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
I'm vocabulary preview today, we're bringing you two words.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
The first one is vehicle.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Vehicle.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Vehicle.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Vehicle.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
So again, a vehicle is a machine, right?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Right.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
A machine that carries people from one place to another.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
So it's important to say that a vehicle be an airplane.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
A car.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Car boats.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Boat.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Even a bicycle.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Right.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yep.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
That's a vehicle.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Our second word is sedan.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Sedan.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Sedan.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Sedan.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
So a sedan is a type of car.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Exactly.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
It's a type of car with four doors that can fit five people inside.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
So to make it more clear, most taxis are sedans.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Exactly.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Right.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Except taxis in Mexico.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
They're not sedan.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
They're little beetles.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
They're folks like in beetles.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
So they're not sedans.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
But yeah, most countries have sedans.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
To give you some examples, like a Toyota Corolla or a Toyota Camry is a sedan.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Maybe like a Volkswagen Jetta.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Is that it?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
A Jetta?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Now we can listen to our dialogue and it's going to be at a normal speed the first

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
time, but you don't have to worry about it.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
We'll come back and teach you some of the important words from the dials.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Hi there.

01:52.000 --> 02:05.000
Can I help you folks?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
You know how it is.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Dad, I'm 16 already.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
And I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
She's right, you know.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Kids these days all have cars.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Let me show you something we just got in.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
A 1996 sedan, excellent gas mileage.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
It has dual airbags and anti-elect brakes.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
A perfect vehicle for a young driver.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Dad, I love it.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It's awesome.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Can we get this one please?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I see.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
What can you tell me about this one?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
That's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Now about this today.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Whoa, wait a minute.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Tell me more about this tank.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Well, sir, if you're looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
Three inches of reinforced steel, protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
It does not.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Well, I don't know.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Let me sleep on it.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Did I mention the tank?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Is it tank?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I'll take it.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Dad.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Think she's really lucky.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Really?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
She's getting a tank to go to school.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
How awesome is that?

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
I would be so embarrassed to drive to school in a tank.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
It's like the coolest car.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh, you're such a boy.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
All right.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
That's surprising ending to a relatively easy shopping day.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Let's take a look at some language that we saw in our dialogue on language takeaway.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Language takeaway.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
We have four words for you today.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
The first one is gas mileage.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Gas mileage.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Gas mileage.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Gas mileage.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Gas mileage.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
So gas mileage is how many miles you can travel on a gallon or a liter of gasoline.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Well, you know what's interesting.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
In some English-speaking countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, we use kilometers

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
to measure distance.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
But we still talk about gas mileage.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Hmm.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Yep.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
What guess you can't say gas kilo mileage?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
No.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Or something like that.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
But yeah, it's basically how many kilometers or how many miles you can travel

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
on a tank or on a liter or gallon of gas.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Exactly.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Okay.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
The next word is airbags.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Airbags.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Airbags.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Airbags.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Airbags.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
These are like big bags of air that fill up and come out of the car when there's a crash.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Right.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
So that way you don't hit your head against steering wheel or something like that.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
So they protect you.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Right.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I've heard that Volvo has like 18 airbags now in their cars.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
They are very safe cars, you know.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Like a big balloon.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Okay, our third word today is brakes.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Brakes.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Brakes.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Brakes.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
So what are brakes?

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Brakes are little, what are brakes?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Brakes are what make your car stop.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
So they're the little machines maybe that stop your car.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
They're on the wheels.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
They make your car stop.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
You have brakes on your bike.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yes.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Your car.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
etc.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Our last word today on language take away reinforced.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Reinforced.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Reinforced.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Reinforced.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
So we have some examples of how we use reinforced because it's a little bit weird.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
These will help you understand the meaning.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Example one.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
So I reinforced all the walls.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
There's no way they're going to fall down.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Example two.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
This plastic is reinforced with glass.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
So it's both light and strong.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
So basically anything that's reinforced is made stronger.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Perfect.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Reinforced steel.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Reinforced table.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Anything.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Okay.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Great. So now we could listen to our dialogue again.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
You can practice all these words that we just talked about and we'll come back shortly.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Hi there.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Can I help you folks?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I'm just browsing.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Seeing what's on the lot.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
You know how it is.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Dad.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm 16 already.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
And I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
She is right, you know.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Kids these days all have cars.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Let me show you something we just got in.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
A 1996 Sudan.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Excellent gas mileage.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
It has dual airbags and anti-lock brakes.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
A perfect vehicle for a young driver.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Dad, I love it.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It's awesome.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Can we get this one please?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I see.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
What can you tell me about this one?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Oh.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
That's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Now about this Sudan.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Tell me more about this tank.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
then look no further.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short-range missile attacks.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It does not.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Well, I don't know.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Let me sleep on it.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Did I mention the tank is a tank?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I'll take it.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Dad.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
So we have a couple of interesting phrases to talk about shopping.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Right.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Let's look at these in Fluency Builder.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Fluency Builder.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
The first one today is I'm just browsing.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I'm just browsing.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I'm just browsing.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I'm just browsing.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
This is a really useful phrase because usually salespeople will come up to you and ask you,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
can I help you or you're listening something?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
And you're just looking.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah, you maybe you don't really want to buy it.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Right.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
You're just browsing.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So then they'll just leave you alone.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, they won't bother you as much.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, that's a good, good phrase.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Another good phrase.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Sleep on it.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Sleep on it.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Sleep on it.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Sleep on it.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Sleep on it.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
So we have some examples of how we use sleep on it.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Example one.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't know if we should buy that house.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
It's perfect for us, but it's so expensive.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
Let's sleep on it.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Example two.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
Why don't you sleep on it and tell me tomorrow?

09:24.000 --> 09:33.000
Example three.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
This is a bit more than what I can afford.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Let me sleep on it.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
To sleep on it means to like to think about it overnight.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
To think about it.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
So maybe you want to buy this really expensive car.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
But you need to think about it.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Right.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
So you'll sleep on it.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You go home, sleep on it.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Think about it twice and then make a decision.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Exactly.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Okay, great words and great dialogue.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah, I love this dialogue.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's kind of funny.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
So we could listen to it again.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit about it.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Hi there.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Can I help you folks?

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm just browsing, seeing what's on the lot.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
My daughter wants a car for her birthday.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
You know how it is.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Dad, I'm 16 already.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
And I'm like the only one at school who doesn't have a car.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
She's right, you know.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Kids these days all have cars.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Let me show you something we just got in.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
In 1996 sedan, excellent gas mileage.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It has dual airbags and anti-elect breaks.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
A perfect vehicle for a young driver.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Dad, I love it.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
It's awesome.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Can we get this one, please?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I see.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
What can you tell me about this one?

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Oh, that's just an old World War II tank that we use for TV commercials.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Now about this today.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Tell me more about this tank.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
Well, sir, if you're looking for quality and safety, then look no further.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Three inches of reinforced steel, protect your daughter from short range missile attacks.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Does the sedan protector from missile attacks?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
It does not.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, I don't know.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Let me sleep on it.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Did I mention the tank?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Is it tank?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I'll take it.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Dad!

11:27.000 --> 11:37.000
So Marco, have you ever driven a tank?

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
I mean, I know you're in the army, so.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah, actually I did.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I did drive a tank before.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Really?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Really old one.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Kind of like a World War II type tank.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
But yeah, they're really fun and interesting.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
You have, it's not like driving a normal car.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
You have pedals.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
But there's no steering wheel?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
No, no, no.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
You have levers.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
And what many people don't know is that actually tanks are manual transmissions.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
You have to change gears.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Really?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And it's really hard to change gears on those things.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
And what's the gas mileage like a tank?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
I don't know.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Maybe like five miles per gallon.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
They run on diesel, which is a different type of fuel, right?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yep.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Okay, well, very cool.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I never knew that my podcast partner had driven a tank.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
That's pretty awesome.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah, well, it was fun, definitely.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And I hope I get to do it again someday.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
All right.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Well, guys, have you ever driven a tank?

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Or a submarine or any type of armored vehicle.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
Yeah, tell us about it at our website, EnglishPod.com.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Right.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
We'll be there to answer all your questions.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I'll also be there to maybe post some more crazy stories.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Or some pictures of a tank.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, maybe.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
All right, guys.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
We'll see you there until then.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Goodbye.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Thank you.
