00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello English learners. Welcome back to another great lesson at English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
And my name is Erica. And today we're going to be building something.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
That's right. We've got a lesson about construction.

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
Cool. So we're going to be working at a construction site today and we're going to learn a lot of cool vocabulary with different types of tools.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
And we'll also learn some phrases that you can use to talk about work.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
So even if you're not really interested in building and making stuff with your hands,

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
you will learn some language to talk about work in general.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
All right. So before we get started with this construction dialogue,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Marco, we're going to look at two words now.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
And like you said, we're building something in this lesson, right?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Right. We're going to be building a deck.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
A deck.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
A deck.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
All right. So a deck. What is that?

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
Basically it's an elevated wooden platform that houses will have like in their backyards maybe.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
So it's a platform that's a little bit higher off the ground behind your house.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
So it's very popular for houses to have decks.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
And people will put out a table and chairs and maybe have lunch out there.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Or barbeque or something.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Yep. Okay. So a deck.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Now they're building this deck and they need to follow some plans.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Plans.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Plans.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
The plans that we're talking about are construction plans.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah. It's kind of like the map for the deck.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Mm-hmm.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
How you're going to build it?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Exactly. So we can have floor plans for example.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
So that shows you how the building looks like where the different rooms are.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And like a house, right?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
So it's basically the map for a construction.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Okay. Great. So two interesting words.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
We're going to hear both of these in the dialogue.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
Now why don't we get started and find out what's going to happen as they're building this deck.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
All right. Ladies and gentlemen.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
We've been hired to build a deck on this here house and turn this boring and drab lawn into a backyard oasis.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
There is one catch though. We've only got one day to finish this.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
So I'm going to need everyone to give 110% today.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
It's going to be tough.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
But we've got a great team here and I know that together we can tackle this project.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
That being said, let's get to work.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
That's right.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
No. Remember, we've been over the plans.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
But we really need to make sure that everything is up to code.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
The home inspectors here are pretty thorough.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
So please make sure you follow the plans exactly.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And remember the carpenter's rule of thumb.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Measure twice.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Cut once.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Okay, guys. Let's get out of it.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Bob passed me that hammer.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
The nails won't go in.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
The wood is too hard.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I think I'm going to need the nail gun.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
That did it.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Hey.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Do me a favor and help me cut this two by four.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Well, yeah. Pass me that circle saw.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And grab hold of the end of the board.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Now, how many drill some holes in it?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
So we can place the bolts.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I think you should sand the edges.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Look at all these splinters.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Someone could get hurt.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Geez. You got to take pride in your work.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah, you're right.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Pass me the sander and I'll take care of it.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Julia, get over here with that level, measuring tape,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
and that box of screws.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Oh, no.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Look out below.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Alright, so there are a lot of people building the deck.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
They have to build it fast.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
They've only got one day.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So it's a really big challenge, huh?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah, and I think this is a good lesson

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
in maybe not rushing through important projects, right?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Exactly.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
So we saw some really interesting tools that they were using.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
So why don't we look at that first in language takeaway?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Language takeaway.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Alright, so we've got some language all about tools.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
So why don't we just get started?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So they mentioned a nail gun.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Nail gun.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
A nail gun.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
So we all know about hammers and nails, right?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Right. So the nails are what you put in the wood.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Exactly. Now, this is an advanced tool,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
so you don't have to use a hammer.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
It's kind of hard to explain, so why don't we listen to the sound this tool makes.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Well, I guess like it's name suggests,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
it's a gun for putting nails in wood.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah, it actually uses compressed air to push nails

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
really fast into the wood.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Alright, so they're nailing some pieces of wood together,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
but they also needed to cut the wood and they said,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
help me cut the two by four.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, she said help me cut this two by four.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
So a two by four.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
This is a very popular type of wood that you use in construction.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
A two by four is basically two inches by four inches.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
So two inches high and four inches wide.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
So it's the most popular in common type of wood that you would use for construction.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
A two by four.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
You'll hear it all the time.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
So they're going to cut the two by four.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
And see said, pass me this circular saw.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
A circular saw.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
A circular saw.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
So a saw we understand is something you used to cut wood.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
But you have many types of saws.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
You have a bandsaw.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
You have a circular saw.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
And this one makes this sound.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
So I guess it's called a circular saw

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
because the blade or the cutting part is shaped in a circle.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah, a circular saw.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
So after they cut the piece of wood, one of the guys said,

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I think you should sand the edges to sand something.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
All right.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
So if you want to sand usually a piece of wood,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
you want to use paper covered in sand to make it very smooth.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, exactly.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
And so they also mentioned a sander, right?

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
A sander is basically a machine that has this sand paper on it.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And we'll do the hard work for you.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
All right.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
So to sand something and a sander.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Now our next word is very related to sanding something.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
Because if you don't sand a piece of wood, it might have splinters.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Splinters splinters.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Splinters.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
So like I said, if you cut a piece of wood,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
they're little pieces of wood that stick out.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
And you can get hurt.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
They can get into your skin.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
So tiny, tiny parts of wood.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
That's called a splinter.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Okay. So why don't we go on to our next tool.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
They were talking about a level.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
A level.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
The level.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
All right.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
So this is a tool that all carpenters have.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
And it's basically a tool that has a little bit of water in it, right?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
And it helps you make sure that everything is straight and flat.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Exactly.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
So that's a level every carpenter has it.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
And also a measuring tape.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
A measuring tape.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Now I'm sure if this was a video podcast,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
we could show you what a measuring tape was.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
And you really understand it.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
But we'll do our best to describe it for you.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
So a measuring tape is like a ruler that rolls up.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Mm-hmm.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah. It's a very convenient ruler because you can roll up

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
and you can measure something that is maybe six feet

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
or three meters long.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
And you can extend it.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
And when you're done measuring,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
you can put it back and just put it in your pocket.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Every carpenter has one.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
A measuring tape.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
All right.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
So that's our last tool that we're going to talk about.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
So why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder,

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
where we've got some phrases that you can use to talk about work.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Fluency Builder.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
So when the contractor started giving them instructions,

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
he said,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I need everyone to give 110% today.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
To give 110%.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
So when you give 110%.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
You are basically trying very hard.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah. You give everything you have to your job.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Right.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
So it's not only 100% it's 110 more than what's needed.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
So no lunch break.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Exactly.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So as they were talking about the instructions,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
one of the guys said,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
the carpenters rule of thumb.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
A rule of thumb.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So this is an interesting phrase.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Rule of thumb.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
What does that mean?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Exactly.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Okay. Well, you know what?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I think we can understand the meaning pretty clearly

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
if we listen to some examples.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Example one.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
The rule of thumb in making a sale is confidence.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Without confidence, you don't make a sale.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Example two.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
The Taylor's rule of thumb is twice the circumference of the risk

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
as the circumference of the net.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Example three.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
You don't have to take everything I say about marketing

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
as a rule of thumb.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
One of the guys noticed a few problems.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
You know, the splinters.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
And he said, you've got to take pride in your work.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Okay. So to take pride in your work.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
So take pride in your work.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
So why did he say that to her?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
What is he trying to tell her?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Well, because she made him some mistakes,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
she didn't do such a good job.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
He's wanting her to work harder, work better.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Work more carefully.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Okay. And so she can be proud of her work

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
and say this is a job well done.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
So when you take pride in your work,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
you work so well and do such a good job that you feel

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
really happy about it.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
All right. Good.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
So why don't we listen to this dialogue again

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
for the last time?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
And then we'll come back and talk about construction.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
We've been hired to build a deck on this here house

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
and turn this boring and drab lawn

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
into a backyard oasis.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
There is one catch though.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
We've only got one day to finish this.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
So I'm going to need everyone to give

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
one hundred and ten percent today.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
It's going to be tough,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
but we've got a great team here

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
and I know that together,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
we can tackle this project.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
That being said, let's get to work.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
That's right.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
No, remember, we've been over the plans.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
But we really need to make sure that everything

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
is up to code.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
The home inspectors here are pretty thorough.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
So please make sure you follow the plans exactly.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
And remember, the carpenter's rule of thumb.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Measure twice, cut once.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Okay, guys.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Let's get out of it.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Bob passed me that hammer.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
The nails won't go in.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
The wood is too hard.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I think I'm going to need the nail gun.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
That did it.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Hey, do me a favor and help me cut this two by four.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Pass me that circle saw.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
And grab hold of the end of the board.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Now, how many drill some holes in it?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
So we can place the bolts.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
I'm going to make sure that it's not too hard.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
I'm going to make sure that it's not too hard.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
I think you should sand the edges.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Look at all these splinters.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Someone could get hurt.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Geez.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
You got to take pride in your work.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah, you're right.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Pass me the sander and I'll take care of it.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Julia, get over here with that level.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Measuring tape and that box of screws.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Oh, no.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Look out below.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
So an interesting aspect of North American culture is a project like this, right?

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Building a deck or maybe adding a room to your house.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah, that's right.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
And we call this DIY.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Right.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
DIY.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Do it yourself.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
So it's a very popular summer project, right?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Right.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So if you live in a neighborhood in North America,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
you might see the dad of a family outside building something.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
All his friends come over and they drink beer and build this big thing together.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Right.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
So it could be a tree house.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
It could be a deck.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
It could even maybe be adding another room to the house.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah, and you know, it's actually it's so popular that there are tons of TV shows about

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
how to build stuff for your house.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
And there are a lot of really big stores where you can go and find all of this equipment for building

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
stuff for your house.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Right.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So basically there are these big stores where you can get anything from paint to wood.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
To tools huge amount of material so you can do it yourself.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
You can do DIY.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
All right.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
So that's all the time we have for today.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
But let us know what you think and tell us if you are into doing handy work like this,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
like maybe building a tree house or building a deck.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
That's right.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
You can come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us about it as well.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
You can also leave your questions there.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
All right.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
So we'll see you guys there and until next time.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Thanks for listening and goodbye.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Thank you.
