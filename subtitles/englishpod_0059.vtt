00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco, and I'm Erica.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
And today we're bringing you another great advanced lesson for all those advanced users out there.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
That's right. This is a really, really useful lesson for all of our advanced users.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Exactly. You asked for a lesson about job interviews, and well, here we are.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
We're bringing you the first of three parts of the job interview series.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
All right, so Marco, you said it is the first of three parts.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
And so tell me what are these three parts?

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Okay, in this lesson, we're going to be looking at preparing for a job interview.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Okay, so everything you got to do before the job interview, part two will be talking about your education, your background, your work experience.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Okay, and in part three, we'll take a look at some of the common questions that are asked at a job interview.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm so we'll talk about some great ways to answer these questions.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
All right, these three lessons will be coming out over the next month or so.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Exactly. So we're going to be looking at part one today, so let's take a look at some vocabulary preview.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Very vocabulary preview.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Well, we have three words here in vocabulary preview that you'll hear in the dialogue in a moment.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
And the first one is actually not really a word, but an acronym.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Right, CRM.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
CRM.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
CRM.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
So Marco, you are our marketing guide. Tell us what is the CRM?

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Well, it's really common in marketing. It stands for customer relationship management.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Okay.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Our customer relation management.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
But basically, it's the relationship that the company has with its customers.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Okay.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
So CRM basically has parts like feedback or customer support.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Problems that they might have.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
And also information about habits and likes and dislikes from their customers or users.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Right, but I, I don't, I commonly hear this word used as a noun.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
So something like, can you check in the CRM?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Right, there is some software out there that that's called the CRM.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
So sugar CRM or many different softwares, which basically manages your database of customers.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Basically, software that then glows this whole thing.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Okay. Got it.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
All right. Our next phrase in vocabulary preview.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Custom design.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Custom design.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Custom design.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Custom design.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
So when something is custom designed, it means it's a special design just for you.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
So it's unique.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Right.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
That's what the word custom means.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Unique.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Like made is specially for one person.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Right. So you have custom design or also custom made.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
You see that a lot for example in cars, right?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
A custom made car.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yes.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Or maybe a custom built house.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
A custom built house.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yep.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
With your specific likes and dislikes.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah, your requirements.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yep.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Okay. And our last word.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Core values.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Core values.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Core values.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Core values.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Core values.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So the core values of a company.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
What is the core meaning actually?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
The center.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
The center, right?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yep.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
So in here, I think it's like the center or the most important.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
The most important thing is the company believes in, right?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Right.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
So maybe respects for the environment.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Okay.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Or developing their employees.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Okay.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
So the core values.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yep.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
A great phrase for a job interviews.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Oh, yes.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Very good phrase.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Okay. So why don't we listen to a dialogue.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Erica, what exactly is happening?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
All right. We're going to be listening to two friends.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Um, and this guy is getting ready to go on a job interview.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
So his friend is helping him to prepare.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So let's go over everything one more time.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I really want you to get this job.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
I know.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
It's an amazing growth opportunity.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
They're true industry leaders.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
And it would be so interesting to be part of a organization that is the undisputed leader

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
in business process platform development.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
So let's see.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
You did your research on the company, right?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Wow.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I visited the website and read up on what they do.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
They're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
for large corporations.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
They provide services such as CRM development.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
And they also offer custom design applications.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
So what would be your role in the company?

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Well, the position is for an account manager.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
That basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Sounds good.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
And so why do you want to work with them?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Well, as I said, they're the industry leaders.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
They have a really great, gross strategy.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Amazing development opportunities for employees.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
And it seems like they have a strong corporate governance.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
They're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Oh, and they offer a six weeks vacation, stock options, and bonuses.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I'm totally gonna cash in on that.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
You idiot.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
You don't say that.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Do you want this job or not?

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, right.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
So he was doing great, but in the end he said something he shouldn't, right?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
I don't think talking about money as your primary motivation for coming on to new companies.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Really the way to go.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And we're going to talk about that a little bit later.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
But let's take a look real quick at some language takeaway.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Language takeaway.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
Alright, in this lesson, we have five keywords for you from the dialogue, which we hope that you will remember.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Let's take a look at the first one.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Undisputed.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Undisputed.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Undisputed.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Undisputed.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
So this is kind of a strange word.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Let's listen to some examples before we explain it.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Example one.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
It's undisputed that she's the best person for the job.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Example two.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
The undisputed truth is that unemployment is rising.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
No one doubts that.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Example three.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Is the undisputed champion of the world?

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Well, I can understand from these examples that it means there is no doubt.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
There is no doubt.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
There's no question.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Okay.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Now let's take a look at our second word.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Growth opportunity.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Growth opportunity.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
It's a great growth opportunity.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
So it's an excellent chance to improve, right?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Improved professionally and also on a personal side, right?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
So talking about growth opportunities, we can also use the phrase a development opportunity.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
And it's the same thing to develop to grow.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
To improve yourself.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Okay.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Now let's take a look at our third word.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Read up.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Read up.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Read up.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Read up.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
So when you read up on something.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, obviously you read it, right?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Right.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
But you're reading it specifically for some information.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
So you can know more about the subject.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
So it's kind of similar to study, right?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Kind of.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
But really with the idea that you're trying to improve your knowledge about a particular

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
field.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Okay.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Now for our fourth word.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Unleash potential.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Unleash potential.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Unleash potential.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Okay.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
So to unleash.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
All right.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Well, I'm going to paint a picture for you.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
All right.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
So imagine you have your dog, right?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And your dog is walking on a leash.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Like it has a string or a rope attached to it.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Right.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
So then when you undo the leash, you unleash the dog and then what happened.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
It goes around and it's running.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
It's going everywhere.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
So if you unleash potential, you release it and let it go and help it grow and become bigger.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Exactly.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
So you give it freedom.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
So potential is the capabilities or abilities that a person has, right?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
To do something great.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Unleash potential.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
This I think is an excellent word to use in a job interview.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I think it is really descriptive and really powerful.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
It is.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
It's a good word.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Okay.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
So let's take a look at our last one now.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Resonate with.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Resonate with.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Resonate with.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Resonate with.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
So he mentioned this really resonated with me.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
So what does he mean by resonated?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I guess he means it connected to him, right?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
It touched him.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
So he agrees with this idea or he feels that he can relate to it.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Exactly.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
You know what?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I think this one needs a few examples to really show it's meaning.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Okay.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Let's listen.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Example one.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
The candidate speech really resonated with the voters.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Example two.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Their music doesn't really resonate with me.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Example three.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Their commitment to fight global warming resonates with me.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
All right.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
So it's clear now to resonate with.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Right?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Okay.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
So why don't we go and listen to our dialogue for the last time.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And then we'll come back and give you some great pointers about preparing for a job interview.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Okay.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
So let's go over everything one more time.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I really want you to get this job.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I know it's an amazing growth opportunity.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
They're true industry leaders and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So let's see.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
You did your research on the company, right?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Wow.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I visited the website and read up on what they do.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
They're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
They provide services such as CRM development.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
And they also offer custom design applications.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
So what would be your role in the company?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Well, the position is for an account manager.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
That basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Sounds good.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
And so why do you want to work with them?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Well as I said, they're the industry leaders.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
They have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
And it seems like they have a strong corporate governance.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
They're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Oh, and they offer six weeks of education, stock options, and bonuses.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I'm totally gonna cash in on that.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
You idiot, you don't say that.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Do you want this job or not?

10:55.000 --> 11:05.000
Okay, so preparing for a job interview is really important, right?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yes.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
And we're gonna give you some really basic tips about how you can prepare for a job interview.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I've got to confess something to you, Marko.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
What?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I love job interviews.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Really?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, I know it's really weird.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Most people hate them, but I love them.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
So you love being the interviewer or going to job interviewer?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Really?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah, I like everything about them.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
So I feel like I have a lot of passion to share with you about this.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
All right, so let's take a look at the first point or the first tip that you can help us out with.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
So before you go to a job interview, you should do a little bit of research, right?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Right, and that's our first point.

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
It's really important to know as much as you can about the company, their history, their product, their management style.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Just as much information as you can find out about how they work and what they do.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And why do you think this is important?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Well, basically, you'll be asked about it in the interview.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Right.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
And so if you show that you haven't prepared, you haven't done any research, you show that you don't care.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
One of the best ways that you can impress in a job interview is to show that you know about the company.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Mm-hmm.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Important things like, you know what kind of products they offer or what's their largest market.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
And I guess that really impresses the interviewer because it shows that you are interested in this company.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
They really want the job.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
And that you are willing to do the extra work it takes to prepare yourself.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
So I think that will show the interviewer that later on when you're working for them, you'll do that extra work on the job.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Exactly, that's a really good point.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
So that's our first point or first tip to do some research.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Yes.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Now, you've done your research, you know everything about the company, what else should you do?

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Once you've read up on the company, you've got to spend some time thinking about yourself.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Mm-hmm.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
You've got to prepare to sell yourself to the company.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
So to sell yourself to really demonstrate them why you are the perfect person for the job.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Right, because a lot of people think about why they want to work for the company, right?

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
Because they feel like they're aligned with the core values or the message of the company resonates with them.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Mm-hmm.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
But what the interviewer really wants to hear is how you, the interviewee, is going to benefit the company.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
What are you going to bring to the company?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Right, and this is the most important part is to know what are your skills, right?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Yes.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
And it's not enough to just say, well, I am a great leader.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Right.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
So if you are a great leader, you should be ready to give an example of how you have demonstrated to be a great leader.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yes.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
All right.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
So maybe like an example, like, I'm a really strong leader because in my previous job,

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
I had the best JD power ratings for employee satisfaction.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Mm-hmm.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Okay.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
So you are actually showing with numbers or with facts that you are a great leader.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
The key thing here, I think, is identify what your strengths and skills are.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Think of specific examples.

13:50.000 --> 13:58.000
If you can give numbers and show how you can bring this skill and your experiences to the new company.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
And now, well, you're ready to tell yourself you've done your research.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Now, you have all of these things in your mind.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Mm-hmm.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
You have to practice.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Yes.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Right.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
And a much overlooked stage in the preparation.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
People think it through, they write things down, but don't really practice.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Yeah.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
So I know you have a few tips about how you can practice interviewing effectively.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Mm-hmm.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Okay. Well, the first thing that you should do is use your friends.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
They've got to be good for something.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Exactly.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And well, probably your friends are also working at a company.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Maybe their managers or maybe they've interviewed someone before already.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
So you can set up a mini interview and have them pretend that they are the interviewer.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Mm-hmm.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
You can ask you these questions and you're trying to answer seriously.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
And I'm sure that your friends can give you some great feedback.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Maybe what you did write, maybe what you did wrong.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
So that's a really good way.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And another thing is also you can record yourself.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yes.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Right.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah. If you have a video camera or even a web.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I mean, many people have a web camera like right in your laptop.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Mm-hmm.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Record yourself actually doing the practice interview with your friends.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
And this is really useful because you can later see what you recorded.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Mm-hmm.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
And detect some of the things that maybe aren't really useful or good.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
You know, for example, posture is a really important aspect.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
So what do you mean posture?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
So the way that you are sitting down in your seat.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Yep.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And how you are expressing yourself with your hands.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yep.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Some people, you know, they move a lot during the interview because of course you're nervous.

15:25.000 --> 15:32.000
So maybe they're moving from side to side or playing with their feet or playing with something on the table or moving their hands in an awkward way.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
So those are the things that you have to watch out for.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yes.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
It's really important to sit up straight and to show that you are powerful and in control.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
And another really great thing is eye contact, right?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah. We were talking about this earlier.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
And why is eye contact so important?

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
If an interviewie maintains eye contact with me for like most of the interview.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
I feel like they have really good people skills.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Mm-hmm.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
In my opinion, I would say they have a lot of self confidence.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah, I'd agree.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Right?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Yep.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Because if a person is looking down or not looking directly at you,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
it's either one of two things in my opinion.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
It's either they are not confident enough with themselves or they are lying to you.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Yes.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Right?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Or also they just they don't have good people skills.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yeah.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Which is a problem in today's sort of knowledge based economy.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Exactly.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Mm-hmm.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
So it's really important to maintain eye contact.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
And one other really important thing related to eye contact posture is the handshake.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Mm-hmm.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
When you get to the interview, it's really really important to give a firm good handshake.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
So what qualifies as a firm good handshake?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Well, you don't have to prove that you are ultra strong, right?

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
You don't have to squeeze the other person's hand really hard.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
And like break their hands.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Exactly.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
It's not like a strength contest.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
No.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
A good firm handshake is squeezing normally not too tight, not too loose.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
But your entire palm, your entire hand has to be in contact with the other person's palm or hand.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Yes.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Don't give them the fingers.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
You know, like some people give you only four fingers or half their hand.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
I hate that.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I hate it too.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
And this goes for men and for women because a lot of women do this.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Yep.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I call this the deadfish handshake.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
The deadfish.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
It is kind of like a deadfish or the dead handhandshake.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Yeah.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
I absolutely agree with you on this one.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
So nice firm handshake.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Yep.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
firm handshake.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
And well, these are our tips for preparing for the interview and everything you have to do before it.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
I'm sure there are a lot more things out there.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
So, and I'm sure our users have some insight on this as well.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
I'd love to hear it because like I told you, I love job interviews.
