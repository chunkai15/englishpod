Hello English learners and welcome to another great lesson with us here at English Pod My Name is Marco

00:07.600 --> 00:12.320
and I'm Erica and today we're bringing you a great upper intermediate lesson

00:12.320 --> 00:16.560
that's right we're going to talk about a topic that's been in the news recently

00:16.560 --> 00:22.880
and this topic is the bird flu that's right so can you tell us what the bird flu really is

00:22.880 --> 00:27.360
basically the story is a lot of chickens and birds keep getting this disease

00:27.360 --> 00:32.880
and they've managed to pass this disease to humans and the fear is that humans will

00:32.880 --> 00:37.680
start to pass this disease to each other and a huge, huge number of people in the world

00:37.680 --> 00:44.320
could get really sick okay yes so it sounds scary well it may be a little bit scary but we do

00:44.320 --> 00:49.360
have some interesting language we've got language to talk about a disease and language

00:49.360 --> 00:54.880
that you might use in a planning meeting at work all right so let's start by looking at

00:54.880 --> 01:02.560
our vocabulary preview for this dialogue okay the first word on our vocabulary preview today is

01:02.560 --> 01:11.920
contingency plan contingency plan contingency plan so a contingency plan is a plan that you

01:11.920 --> 01:18.080
make to prepare for an emergency so like a backup plan exactly okay yeah contingency plan

01:18.720 --> 01:26.080
and our last word for the vocabulary preview today is pandemic pandemic pandemic pandemic

01:26.080 --> 01:32.960
so pandemic is something scary well yes it's an event where a disease affects a lot of people

01:32.960 --> 01:40.320
like we're talking millions of people okay and it spreads very quickly and it goes international

01:40.640 --> 01:47.360
okay so a disease that spreads very fast and goes everywhere exactly okay pandemic okay so we're

01:47.360 --> 01:52.960
ready to listen to our dialogue we are going to be at a business meeting where people are talking

01:52.960 --> 02:07.600
about a contingency plan well right let's move to our next order of business as many of you are

02:07.600 --> 02:14.080
aware in recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding this bird flu issue

02:14.720 --> 02:20.080
and it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu contingency plan

02:20.960 --> 02:25.600
basically we need to come up with a clear plan we need to outline specific actions that our

02:25.600 --> 02:30.320
company can take to maintain critical business functions in case of pandemic strikes

02:31.120 --> 02:36.320
so what I'd like to do is first a point someone to look after drafting our plan

02:37.040 --> 02:43.200
Ralph I'd like you to head up this project sure enough problem what issues do you want me to consider?

02:43.200 --> 02:48.640
well let's see there are a few points we need to be thinking about first I'll need you to

02:48.640 --> 02:54.320
analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an outbreak I have you'll also need

02:54.320 --> 03:00.080
to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected think of ways to reduce

03:00.080 --> 03:06.320
employee customer contact perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home

03:07.120 --> 03:12.560
I guess you'll need me to focus employee absence as well right and I'll think about the impact this

03:12.560 --> 03:17.440
will have on our clients hey what about vaccines should be but thinking about getting vaccines for

03:17.440 --> 03:30.720
our employees exactly right so I'll leave this to you and we'll review the draft plan in

03:30.720 --> 03:44.480
two weeks okay so anyone want to order some KFC for lunch all right what an ironic meeting

03:45.040 --> 03:50.320
they are talking about the bird flu and they are going to have chicken yes after a sneezing all over

03:51.360 --> 03:55.520
yeah I guess now we could take a look at our language takeaway for this dialogue

03:55.920 --> 04:02.320
language takeaway we heard a lot of really useful language in this dialogue and right now we're

04:02.320 --> 04:09.600
going to look at four different words from the dialogue the first one is critical critical critical

04:10.160 --> 04:14.960
critical we've got some examples of this word that will help us to understand the meaning so let's

04:14.960 --> 04:24.720
listen example one it's absolutely critical that we increase our sales if not the company will go bankrupt

04:25.600 --> 04:35.440
example two we have a critical shortage of food if we don't get help people will die

04:38.800 --> 04:45.680
example three this is a critical step in the process you can't make a mistake here

04:48.240 --> 04:55.280
so when something's critical it's basically really important really urgent right okay great word critical

04:55.360 --> 05:02.560
the next word we have is outbreak outbreak outbreak and outbreak so when outbreak is

05:02.560 --> 05:09.440
is a sudden start of a disease right hmm can I say oh I got an outbreak of flu can

05:09.440 --> 05:15.840
outbreak describe one person no an outbreak means that it's infecting a lot of people okay not only one

05:15.840 --> 05:21.120
person so that we could say there was an outbreak of the flu at the office right which there was yeah

05:21.200 --> 05:26.720
a lot of people got sick here with the flu yeah okay why don't you tell us about our third word

05:26.720 --> 05:36.320
our third word is forecast forecast forecast forecast so to forecast basically means to predict exactly

05:36.320 --> 05:42.560
for example you talk about the weather forecast yep okay great and the last word for a language take

05:42.560 --> 05:51.920
away is vaccines vaccines vaccines vaccines so vaccines are something we all had when we were children

05:51.920 --> 06:00.640
that's true they are injections that you get to prevent you from getting sick later right so an

06:00.640 --> 06:05.920
injection of medicine from your doctor so that you don't get a disease in the future right when we

06:05.920 --> 06:14.480
are small we get polio vaccine yeah measles vaccines yeah a lot of common diseases yes okay so that's

06:14.480 --> 06:19.440
all for language take away some great language related to health and disease but we also heard

06:19.440 --> 06:24.320
some great business related words in this dialogue that's true there's a lot of words that you can

06:24.320 --> 06:31.440
use in a planning meeting so let's look at those now in fluency builder fluency builder

06:31.440 --> 06:36.400
in today's fluency builder we're going to look at four useful phrases now this first phrase

06:36.400 --> 06:43.120
you can use when you want to change the subject at a meeting let's listen to what they said

06:43.120 --> 06:52.480
in the dialogue let's move to our next order of business let's move to our next order of business

06:53.840 --> 06:59.520
okay so let's move to our next order of business it's a great way of saying let's move on

06:59.600 --> 07:04.560
exactly it's passed to the next topic hmm great speaking of passing to the next topic we heard

07:04.560 --> 07:10.000
another really interesting phrase in the dialogue let's listen we need to come up with a clear plan

07:11.520 --> 07:16.720
we need to come up with a clear plan so we need to come up with a clear plan we need to

07:17.440 --> 07:23.440
think of think of a clear plan yeah yeah we need to come up with yeah okay our third phrase

07:23.440 --> 07:29.360
we heard in the dialogue is this okay i'd like you to hit up this project so this

07:29.360 --> 07:35.920
phrase head up this is a great phrase it means i'd like you to lead or take care of this project

07:35.920 --> 07:43.200
okay and the last phrase for fluency builder you can use when you want to give someone the

07:43.200 --> 07:54.960
responsibility of a job we heard this so i'll leave this to you so i'll leave this to you this is

07:55.040 --> 08:01.040
you take charge exactly i'll leave this to you that's a great way of delegating a responsibility and

08:01.040 --> 08:07.280
so we're gonna leave you to listen to our dialogue a last time and be sure to pick up all the

08:07.280 --> 08:18.400
great vocabulary that we just talked about well right let's move to our next order of business

08:18.880 --> 08:25.040
as many of you are aware in recent weeks there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding

08:25.040 --> 08:31.680
this bird flu issue and it's come to my attention that our company lacks any sort of bird flu

08:31.680 --> 08:37.600
contingency plan basically we need to come up with a clear plan we need to outline specific

08:37.600 --> 08:43.040
actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case of pandemic strikes

08:43.760 --> 08:49.120
so what i'd like to do is first point someone to look after drafting our plan

08:49.760 --> 08:55.840
Ralph i'd like you to head up this project sure and no problem what issues do you want me to consider

08:55.840 --> 09:01.360
well let's see there are a few points we need to be thinking about first i'll need you to

09:01.360 --> 09:06.160
analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an outbreak i have

09:06.160 --> 09:11.520
you'll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected

09:11.520 --> 09:17.600
think of ways to reduce employee customer contact perhaps some IT solutions that will allow

09:17.600 --> 09:23.600
our people to work from home i guess you'll need me to focus employee absence as as well right

09:23.600 --> 09:28.320
and i'll think about the impact this will have on our clients hey what about vaccines should

09:28.320 --> 09:37.920
be the thinking about getting vaccines for our employees exactly right so i'll leave this to you

09:37.920 --> 09:47.680
and uh well we'll review the draft plan in in two weeks okay so anyone want to order some KFC for lunch

09:55.520 --> 10:02.160
okay great so this contingency plan idea is really interesting right yeah it makes sense for

10:02.160 --> 10:07.520
a company to prepare in case there is an outbreak of bird flu i mean they need to maintain their

10:07.520 --> 10:13.120
critical business functions even if all the employees are sick hey right i guess that's really

10:13.120 --> 10:19.040
important and uh you have to forecast all these uh possibilities like people are going to be away

10:19.040 --> 10:25.920
from the office or even forecast less sales etc that's right the interesting thing is that

10:25.920 --> 10:30.800
businesses that may not actually be involved in food production or raising chickens or something

10:30.800 --> 10:35.760
like that are making these contingency plans i find that really fascinating so it seems there is

10:35.760 --> 10:41.760
a lot of fear out there about the possibility of a pandemic yeah yeah well hopefully they'll come

10:41.760 --> 10:46.880
out with the vaccines so we don't have to worry about these things that's true but until then

10:46.880 --> 10:51.200
we'll have to create contingency plans that's right okay guys we're out of time today and i

10:51.200 --> 10:56.080
