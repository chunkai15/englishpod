00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello English-letters, welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
And I'm Erica.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
We're bringing you a great elementary podcast today.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
That's right.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
And we're going to be teaching you how to order pizza.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Yeah, you know, pizza is one of my favorite foods and the favorite food of many people.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Exactly. It's one of those common foods that you're at home and you want to order something to eat.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
And the typical thing is pizza.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Yeah, but you know, there's some very special language that you've got to use.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
And you've got to know this language when you want to order a pizza.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Exactly.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
So let's listen to this dialogue for the first time as a man is ordering pizza.

00:41.000 --> 00:56.000
Uh, good evening. Pizza house. This is Marty's beginning. May I take your order?

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Um, yes. I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni olives and extra cheese.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas. Would you like a large pizza instead?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Sure, that sounds good.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Great. Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
No. Make the second one with ham, pineapple, and green peppers. Oh, and make it thin crust.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Okay. Then crust. Your total is 21-50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Perfect. Thank you, bye.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Sir, wait. I need your address.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Okay. So I guess he's not getting his pizza.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
No. He forgot to give his address.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
That's a bit of a problem. Okay. Let's take a look at some of the vocabulary in language takeaway.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Language takeaway.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
All right. We've got some great pizza words for you today.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Um, and the first one we have is a medium pizza.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Medium pizza.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Medium pizza.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
So that's the size, right?

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah. Medium. You can say medium or 12 inch.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
12 inch. Usually a medium pizza is 12 inches.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah. So you could say I'd like a 12 inch pizza.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
Okay. For those of us who use centimeters, this would be more or less 30 centimeters.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Okay.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
All right. Let's take a look at the next size, a large pizza.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Large pizza.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
A large pizza.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
So it might also be called an 18 inch.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
18 inch pizza.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Or isn't it sometimes called a family size?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Maybe.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Family size.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I guess it depends where you're ordering.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Okay. So large and medium pizzas.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Now let's take a look at some of the ingredients.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay. We have pepperoni.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Pepperoni.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Pepperoni.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
This is the common ingredient in all pizza.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
It's my favorite.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
A pizza is not a pizza unless it has pepperoni.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Okay. So pepperoni is a sausage, right?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah. It's a little bit spicy.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
A little bit spicy.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
And they look like a like circles.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Red circles.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yep.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Okay.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
All of us.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
All of us.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
All of us.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
All of us are little black or green balls.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Yes.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Little green or black balls.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
You can also find them in a martini.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah. Exactly.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Yep. It's very common for them to have it.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
It's very common to have it.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
It's very common to have an olive in a martini.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yes.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Okay. And he also ordered extra cheese.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Extra cheese.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
So that means more cheese.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Extra.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
All right. Another ingredient.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Ham.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Ham.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
The meat of a pig.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah. Ham.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yep.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Okay. And he also ordered another strange ingredient for a pizza.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Pineapple.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Pineapple.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Pineapple.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Now this is a fruit.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I know. So weird to put pineapple on a piece.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Many people like pineapple on their pizza.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
It's a tropical fruit.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yep.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Comes from Hawaii.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Usually.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
And it kind of looks like a little palm tree at the time.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah. The top of a pineapple looks like a tree.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
So pineapple.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yep.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
All right.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Now the last description of a pizza.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
He ordered it with thin crust.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Thin crust.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Thin crust.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Thin crust.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Now we know thin is some skinny skinny.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
But crust.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
What is crust?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It's the bread part of the pizza.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
The outside part.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yep.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Okay. So that's the crust.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
That's my favorite part of the pizza.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Really? Yeah.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Thin crust or thick crust.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Ah.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Thin crust.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Thin crust.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And I just, I really love that bread part.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
It's important.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
So a good pizza.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Okay.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Well, you know, they also have.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
They also have the crust filled with cheese.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
No.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
It's so wrong.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
That's good, too.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
No.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
All right.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Let's listen to our dialogue again.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Good evening.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Pizza host.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
This is Marty speaking.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
May I take your order?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Um, yes.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Would you like a large pizza instead?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Sure. That sounds good.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Great.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
No.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Make the second one with ham, pineapple, and green peppers.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Oh, and make it thin crust.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
Your total is 2150 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Perfect.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Thank you.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Bye.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Sir.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Wait.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I need your address.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Okay.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Now we have some really polite language that you could use.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Possibly with customers or with clients.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Yep.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Okay.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
So let's take a look at them in fluency builder.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Fluency builder.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Okay.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
First phrase we have.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I think it's my favorite.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
This is the way that Marty answered the phone.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Right?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
He said, this is Marty speaking.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
This is Marty speaking.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
This is Marty speaking.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Now, why is it so important?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Because a lot of people when they answer the phone say,

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
I'm Erica, like hello, I'm Erica, which is not what English people say.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
We always say, Erica speaking.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
This is Erica speaking.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Exactly.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Remember this.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
You'll sound really, really great when you use this on the phone.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
This is Marty speaking.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Exactly.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
This is Marty.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Don't use Marty.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Use your name.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
All right.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
And you also mentioned a two for one special.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Two for one special.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Two for one special.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
So that means you're getting two pizzas, right?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
For the price of one.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
And a special is just a special promotion.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
A special price.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Special price.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yes.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Two for one special.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
All right.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Now very easy phrase.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Would you like?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Would you like?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Would you like?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Would you like?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Now this is a great way to offer something.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
It's a more polite way of asking.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Do you want?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Do you want?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Do you want is okay?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah, it's fine.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
But it's less polite than would you like?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Exactly.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
So whenever you offer something, would you like a cup of coffee?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Would you like to sit down?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Okay.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
So would you like?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

07:22.000 --> 07:34.000
And then we'll come back and talk about pizza from a pizza expert.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Good evening.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Pizza house.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
This is Marty's beginning.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
May I take your order?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yes.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni olives and extra cheese.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Would you like a large pizza instead?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Sure, that sounds good.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Great.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
No.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Make the second one with ham, pineapple, and green peppers.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Oh, and make it thin crust.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Okay.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Then crust.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Your total is 21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Perfect.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Thank you, bye.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Sir, wait.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
I need your address.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
All right.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
We're back and we are here with our pizza expert who else but Marco from Italian

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Pod.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Hi, everyone.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Marco too, right?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Marco one.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I am Marco zero.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
He is Marco one.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yes.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
We've come to an agreement.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
So zero.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
What's the deal about this?

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, we're talking about pizza today and we wanted to know what's your opinion

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
since pizza comes from Italy, right?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Well, thanks for the question.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
First, the Marco zero.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Is my mic working?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Yes.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
It should be.

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
So the problem with pizza is that, yes, it comes from Italy.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Reginated, the story goes well with the end.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
All right.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
We didn't see the original margarita.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
We didn't margarita.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
All right.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
But the problem is that now this confusion worldwide pizza and pizza hat,

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
American pizza, Italian pizza, that is not the same thing.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
It's not the same.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
It's not the same.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Okay.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So pizza hat is in Italian pizza.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
No, no.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Oh my god.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
So the, okay, here it goes.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Italian, a little bit of.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Italian's make food, but they're not good at branding it.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Okay.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
America's a very good at branding food.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
So they have Starbucks and pizza hat and blah blah blah.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
The problem is that since they have to branding, they don't change the name.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
So they do this pizza hat.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
It's totally different from Italian pizza.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
What, how is it different?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Have you ever seen the two of them?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Have you ever compared them?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
They are very different.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
That's true.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
So, okay, can you put pineapple and ham on a pizza?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Technically, you could.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Like it's possible.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
As long as you call it Hawaiian, you can put pineapple in everything, I guess.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
But the problem, what I'm trying to say is that the Italian pizza is, you know,

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
you have the flour, the pasta, the pizza.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
The crust, the crust.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
The crust, the tomato sauce, and then the mozzarella cheese.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
And that's the basic.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
And then you can do it on top of it with some variations.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Make a pizza.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
It's basically take everything that you have on the table and put it on it.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
That's the main difference.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
But I'm not saying I'm against American pizza.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm saying that you just should change the name to another thing.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
What are you suggest?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
We should call it Zippa.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Zippa.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
It's closing off.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Close enough.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
But you need like a tail.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Zippa.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Zippa.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
It's okay that it's American.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
A for America.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Maybe.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
A dot Zippa.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
A dot Zippa.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
A dot com.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Can I have a Zippa?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
A Zippa pod dot com.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
So I know that you are very much against having pizza at pizza.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
I like it as an exotic experience because I like the fact that it's so much stuff

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
in it that you cannot even tell the difference between the ingredients.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
You know, they have the super mega super super super super super super super.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
With cheese in the crust.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I don't even know what's inside.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
It's great.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
It's great.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
It's like there's a party in my mouth and everybody's invited.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
That's for me the feeling.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Well, the another interesting thing when we were eating with pizza with Marco is that

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
you notice the way that people from different countries eat pizza.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
That's right.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It's how many people fold their pizza?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
We do fold it.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And another thing is that we have a whole pizza.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Like if I order one pizza.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
It's not like I share everybody as one slice of it.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
We order one pizza.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
You order your pizza.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
You order her pizza.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
And so on.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Pizza is personal.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Pizza is a person.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Don't mess with my pizza, Mark.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
The zero.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
All right.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Well, this whole pizza discussion.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Let's see what our listeners have to say about it.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I know that we have listeners from all over the world.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And what do they do with their pizzas?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Yes.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Or their Zipas.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Or their Zipas.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
What do you like on your pizza?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Exactly.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
For example, I'll hide you on the crust to be.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Then I'll hide.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
I know that for example, you want your crust to be.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
I know that for example, in some countries they put ketchup on their pizza.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
I know once I was eating pizza.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
I had a Japanese friend who ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
And the pizza had the pineapple and other stuff on it.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
And then she took out ketchup and mayonnaise.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Oh, no.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Oh, no.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Like wild.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Although I must tell you, I like to bash go on my pizza.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
And I know that's wrong.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
I know.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Sorry.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
But I like it.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
No.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You do what you have to do, Erica.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Then you know, history will judge you because of that.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
All right.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
We better go.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
We're out of time and before Marco has a heart attack or an aneurysm or something.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
We're making a main degree here.

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
And if you have any questions for us and also for Marco, because I'm sure he's going to be commenting on this aspect.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Sure.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
So go to our comments section at EnglishPod.com.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
And Marco and I are Marco Zero and I are always there to answer your questions.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
All right.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
We'll see you there.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Bye.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Bye.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Thank you.
