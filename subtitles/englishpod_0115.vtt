00:00.000 --> 00:07.160
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us at English Pod, my name is

00:07.160 --> 00:08.160
Marco.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.160
And I'm Erica.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.560
And today we don't feel very good.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.560
That's right.

00:12.560 --> 00:17.440
Actually in this lesson we're talking about a hangover.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.440
Hangover, wow.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.680
That's an interesting word.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
What does that mean?

00:20.680 --> 00:26.240
Well when you drink beer or wine or vodka, you drink too much a bit.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.320
The next morning you have a hangover.

00:28.320 --> 00:34.240
Ah, okay, so a lot of our listeners have probably experienced the hangover before.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.880
It's very likely.

00:35.880 --> 00:39.240
But the problem is when you have to go to work the next day.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.240
Yes.

00:40.240 --> 00:46.960
And you might need to actually miss work, but you need some good words and phrases to describe

00:46.960 --> 00:48.880
how bad you feel.

00:48.880 --> 00:53.400
Okay, so let's listen to this dialogue for the first time.

00:53.400 --> 01:14.400
We have a guy describing his hangover and why he missed work that day.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.560
Are you okay, man?

01:15.560 --> 01:17.120
You don't look very well.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.840
No, you feel terrible.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.520
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.520
Nice.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.520
So where did you guys go?

01:25.520 --> 01:29.960
Well we hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

01:29.960 --> 01:34.400
Everything was cool until Mike came along and it turned out that it was his birthday

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
yesterday.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.400
Oh no.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.800
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.400
And it's telling me about it.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.400
We drink everything in the bar.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.280
Is that why you missed work today?

01:44.280 --> 01:49.080
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous through up like five times.

01:49.080 --> 01:54.800
I was so dehydrated that I drink a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
day.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.240
I swear I am never going to drink again.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.240
Too bad, man.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.120
Tonight is Tracy's going away party.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.120
She asked if you were going to go.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.320
Oh yeah, I'm there.

02:04.320 --> 02:16.000
All right, so he's never drinking again, but then at the next chance for a party, he's already

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
ready to go.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.120
I think that's the typical lie of every person that drinks.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.120
Is it out?

02:22.120 --> 02:25.560
Never drink again, but a week later or a month later, they are again.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.560
Or a day later.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.560
All right, so we saw some great vocab here.

02:29.560 --> 02:34.440
So let's look at it now in language takeaway.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.560
Language takeaway.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.520
I'm going to look at five words here.

02:39.520 --> 02:46.960
Now the first one, and they talked about how Mike's birthday is a drink fest.

02:46.960 --> 02:47.960
A drink fest.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.560
It's a drink fest.

02:49.560 --> 02:53.600
All right, so we have this word drink fest.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.600
Now what is this fest part?

02:55.600 --> 02:59.440
Well, maybe you recognize the word October fest.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.560
Okay, or festival.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.280
So fest is like a party.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.280
There's lots of food.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.280
There's lots of drink.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.960
A drink fest is an event where there's a lot of drinks.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.600
Okay, so can I have different types of fests?

03:13.600 --> 03:19.080
Yeah, this is a really informal sort of slang way of saying there's lots of something.

03:19.080 --> 03:22.520
So I could say, oh my god, it's a puppy fest.

03:22.520 --> 03:23.760
So there are a lot of puppies.

03:23.760 --> 03:24.760
Uh-huh.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.560
Or I can say like a fast food fest.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.560
Okay, so you're eating a lot of fast food.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.560
There's a lot of fest food.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.560
Yep.

03:30.560 --> 03:31.560
All right, so fest.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.560
Interesting.

03:32.560 --> 03:38.560
Now when he was describing his hangover, he said that he felt really nauseous.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.560
Nautious.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.560
Nautious.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.280
Now I always have a hard time spelling this word.

03:43.280 --> 03:46.960
So N-A-U-S-E-O-U-S.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.960
Nautious.

03:47.960 --> 03:48.960
Nautious.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.840
It kind of seems like you should say Nautious.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.240
Right, but you say Nautious.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.240
Yeah.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.360
Okay, so when you're feeling nauseous, what do you feel like?

03:57.360 --> 04:01.000
So you feel dizzy, you don't feel very well.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Like your stomach hurts.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.640
Yeah, and your head is kind of spinning.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.240
Okay, and you feel like you might throw up.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.640
Right, exactly.

04:08.640 --> 04:13.240
Now this word that you just mentioned throw up is actually our next word.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.120
And, well, we're not going to describe it.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.520
Why don't we just listen to a person throwing up?

04:24.520 --> 04:27.120
Oh, Marco, that was horrible.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.680
Well, that's the only way we could actually explain throw up.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.440
I mean, it's kind of a hard word to explain, but I'm sure everyone understands

04:34.440 --> 04:35.440
now what it means, right?

04:35.440 --> 04:37.600
Okay, the word is two throw up.

04:37.600 --> 04:38.600
Two throw up.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.600
Two throw up.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.600
Our next word.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.200
Now our guy who's hung over, he said, I was so

04:43.200 --> 04:48.160
dehydrated to be dehydrated.

04:48.160 --> 04:52.240
So this is an adjective, and it means that I have no water in my body.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.240
Exactly.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.560
Okay, so I am dehydrated.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.400
I need water.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.560
Yeah, common feeling after drinking too much beer, huh?

04:59.560 --> 05:00.560
Exactly.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.600
Now our final word, he said he had headache, and he said,

05:03.600 --> 05:07.160
my head's been pounding all day.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.240
Okay, so his head has been pounding all day.

05:11.640 --> 05:16.240
Now this verb pounding, it sounds like this.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.840
All right, so a clear example of what your head feels like

05:23.840 --> 05:26.320
when you have this very bad headache.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.240
You can also say I have a pounding headache.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.120
I have a pounding headache, exactly.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.320
Where my head is pounding.

05:33.320 --> 05:37.920
All right, so five great words that we just looked at right now.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.160
So why don't we listen to our dialogue a second time,

05:41.160 --> 05:43.480
let's slow it down just a little bit,

05:43.480 --> 05:46.560
and then we'll come back and take a look at some phrases.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.920
Are you okay, man?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.760
You don't look very well.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.160
No, how do you feel terrible?

05:57.160 --> 05:59.800
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little

05:59.800 --> 06:00.800
out of hand.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.160
Nice, so where did you guys go?

06:03.160 --> 06:07.040
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.640
Everything was cool until Mike came along and it turned out

06:10.640 --> 06:12.480
that it was his birthday yesterday.

06:12.480 --> 06:16.400
Oh no, Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.720
And it's tell me about it.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.800
We drink everything in the bar.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.600
Is that why you missed work today?

06:21.600 --> 06:24.760
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous

06:24.760 --> 06:26.480
through up like five times.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.760
Ew.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.720
I was so dehydrated that I drink a gallon of water

06:30.720 --> 06:33.280
and my head has been pounding all day.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.560
I swear I am never going to drink again.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.880
Too bad, man.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.440
Tonight is Tracy's going away party.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.640
And she asked if you were going to go.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.200
Oh yeah, I'm there.

06:42.200 --> 06:49.560
All right, well, that was a little easier to understand this time.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.160
Now you mentioned that we've got some great phrases.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.360
So let's go to them now and fluency builder.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.040
Fluency builder.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.240
All right, so as we heard in the dialogue,

06:59.240 --> 07:02.080
the party was, I think it was a great party, right?

07:02.080 --> 07:04.080
What sounds like it was fantastic?

07:04.080 --> 07:06.520
Well, apparently it was a great party.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.160
And he said that he went out with Trevor

07:10.160 --> 07:13.320
and things got a little out of hand.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.600
Things got a little out of hand.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.040
Right, so things got a little out of hand.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.400
Now to get out of hand, what's that mean?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.960
Well, we have some examples.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.360
So let's listen to a couple of them

07:25.360 --> 07:26.960
before we explain it.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.120
Example one.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.480
Honey, the kids are getting a little out of hand.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.600
Can you do something?

07:34.720 --> 07:35.880
Example two.

07:35.880 --> 07:41.280
Guys, this argument is getting out of hand.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.280
Let's all calm down.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.480
Example three.

07:45.480 --> 07:49.480
The party last night got out of hand.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.880
The neighbors called the police.

07:51.880 --> 07:58.280
Okay, so when things get out of hand, you lose control.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.280
Exactly.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.280
They get out of control just a little bit, maybe.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.680
Yeah, go a little crazy.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.400
All right, so things got a little out of hand.

08:06.400 --> 08:11.080
Now the opposite of this was everything was cool.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.640
Everything was cool.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.640
So everything was cool.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.120
So basically, everything was okay.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.520
Everything was relaxed.

08:18.520 --> 08:19.840
Everything was going fine.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.680
Exactly.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.680
And then Mike came along and then things got a little out of hand.

08:24.680 --> 08:28.120
Well, that Mike, and now for our last phrase,

08:28.120 --> 08:30.960
he was describing that Mike's birthday party

08:30.960 --> 08:32.360
was a drink fest, right?

08:32.680 --> 08:34.200
And then his friend agreed.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.200
He said, tell me about it.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.200
Tell me about it.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.680
Tell me about it.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.000
Now, what does this mean exactly when he says,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.120
tell me about it?

08:42.120 --> 08:46.320
Basically, it means I completely understand.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.760
I completely agree with you.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.600
Yeah.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.280
Okay.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.800
So I could say, oh my god, Marco, it's so hot outside today.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.800
Right, and I was like, oh, I know, tell me about it.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.400
Right.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.000
So I'm saying, yeah, I agree with you.

08:58.000 --> 08:58.600
You are right.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.440
Yeah.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.120
Very good.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.520
So these phrases, okay.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.960
So three great phrases that we just looked at.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.800
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.280
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

09:10.280 --> 09:24.040
Are you okay, man?

09:24.040 --> 09:25.640
You don't look very well.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.280
I feel terrible.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.880
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

09:31.880 --> 09:32.880
Nice.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.400
So where did you guys go?

09:34.400 --> 09:38.320
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.840
Everything was cool until Mike came along and it turned out that it was his birthday

09:42.840 --> 09:43.840
yesterday.

09:43.840 --> 09:48.840
Oh no, Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure, and it's telling me about it.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.880
We drink everything in the bar.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.640
Is that why you missed work today?

09:52.640 --> 09:57.640
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous through up like five times.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.640
Ew.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.240
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all

10:03.240 --> 10:04.240
day.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.240
I swear.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.680
I am never going to drink again.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.680
Too bad, man.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.600
Tonight is Tracy's going away party.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.600
She asked if you were going to go.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.600
Oh, yeah.

10:12.600 --> 10:17.840
I'm there.

10:17.840 --> 10:22.200
So it sounds like these guys sure like to go out and have a few drinks.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.200
Don't they?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
Yeah, exactly.

10:24.200 --> 10:31.400
And I think this is a very common thing among young people, usually in the United States,

10:31.400 --> 10:37.000
you know, after a day at the office or something they'll go or even Europe they'll go

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
up to the pub, right?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.440
But the thing is that in America and Canada, we're very careful about alcohol and young people,

10:45.440 --> 10:46.440
right?

10:46.440 --> 10:47.440
Yeah, exactly.

10:47.440 --> 10:53.520
The legal drinking age in the most part of the United States is 21 years of age.

10:53.520 --> 11:00.120
And really many parents or families will never let their children drink alcohol until

11:00.120 --> 11:02.120
they're 21.

11:02.120 --> 11:08.360
And also the laws that control alcohol, like for example, on television, if you notice

11:08.360 --> 11:14.240
a TV commercial with beer or a wine, you will never see the person actually drinking

11:14.240 --> 11:15.240
it.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.240
Yeah, that's true.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.840
While another country is okay, you'll see people drinking it and having fun.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.440
And these commercials, they can only maybe put them close to their lips, but not drink

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
it.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.440
Interesting.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.760
I mean, another weird thing is that sometimes you might want to sit in your back

11:29.760 --> 11:34.640
garden or out on your porch and have a beer after work, right?

11:34.640 --> 11:37.120
But in places, it's totally illegal to do that.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.480
You can't be outside with alcohol.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.480
Right?

11:40.480 --> 11:44.440
You can't be seen drinking or you can't be on the sidewalk or on a bus drinking while

11:44.440 --> 11:45.840
in other places you can, right?

11:45.840 --> 11:48.760
You can just have a beer on the subway.

11:48.760 --> 11:52.480
So it's a little bit different policies on alcohol control.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.720
What do you guys think about it?

11:53.720 --> 11:57.920
Do you think it's correct or maybe it's a little bit too exaggerated?

11:57.920 --> 12:01.520
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com and tell us about it.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.000
Alright, we'll see you guys there and until next time.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
