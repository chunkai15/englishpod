Hello English learners. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:14.000
And I'm Erica. And today we're bringing you a lesson that was requested by one of our listeners.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Yes, that's right. We got a request for a dialogue about a receptionist.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
So a receptionist at an office or at a hotel.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
So today's dialogue is simple, but we're going to be looking at some really great phrases.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Yeah, phrases that will help you sound really, really professional and really fluent.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
So we are at an office today and the receptionist is greeting somebody that has an appointment.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Alright, let's see what happens.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Good afternoon. May I help you?

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes, I'm here to see Joanna Stevens. I have an appointment at four.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Certainly. May I take your name? I'll let her know you've arrived.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Sure, it's Josh O'Neal.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Miss Stevens will be with you momentarily. Can I offer you something to drink?

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes, coffee would be nice. Thank you.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Here you are. Miss Stevens is ready for you now.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
I'll show you to her office, right this way.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Just watch your step here.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Ah!

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Well, that's pretty embarrassing, hey?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
That was embarrassing.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
That's what happens to women when they wear high heels, see?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Actually, that happened to me last weekend.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Really?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
I fell down the stairs and my knees are quite blue.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Oh, no, see. High heels are dangerous.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I don't know why women wear them.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Well, I don't know, but that's not what we're here to discover.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
Right. Okay, so let's take a look at some of these great phrases in Fluency Builder.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Fluency Builder.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, I really liked how this receptionist used some excellent phrases to sound really professional.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
And one thing she said was, certainly.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Certainly.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
So why did she say certainly?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Well, this is a nice way to respond.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
To make the other person know that you understand what they said.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
So Joshua Neal said, yes, I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I have an appointment for.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Certainly.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
So she is saying, I understand what you said.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yes.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
And then she said, may I take your name?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
May I take your name?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
May I take your name?

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
So this is a nice way of saying what is your name?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
So now this is really important because if you said, what is your name?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Is that correct?

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
It's correct, but it's not really, very exactly.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Or I would say, polite to a certain extent.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yes.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Okay.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
So may I take your name?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
May I take your name?

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
You use this phrase when you are going to write down the person's name.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Right.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
So if you meet somebody on the street or at a bar, you wouldn't say, may I take your name?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
No.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Unless you're going to write it down.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
So usually for an office setting where the receptionist has to write down the name.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yes.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
All right.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
One more phrase.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Miss Stevens will be with you momentarily.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Okay.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Miss Stevens will be with you momentarily.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Will be with you momentarily.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Okay.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
So this is really polite.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yes.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Momentarily, what does that mean?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
In a moment.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
In a moment.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
In a moment.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Again, she could have said,

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
Miss Stevens will come out soon or Miss Stevens will see you in a minute.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Yes.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
But that's not, again, it's not really that polite, right?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
So when you want to be formal, you can say,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Miss Stevens will be with you momentarily.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Okay.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That's a really nice phrase.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
All right.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
There's so much in this dialogue.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
So many great, wonderful, polite phrases.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
So why don't we listen to it one more time,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
but this time, slow down.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Good afternoon.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
May I help you?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yes.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I have an appointment at four.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Certainly, may I take your name?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I'll let her know you've arrived.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Sure.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
It's Josh O'Neal.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Miss Stevens will be with you momentarily.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Can I offer you something to drink?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Yes.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Coffee would be nice.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Thank you.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Here you are.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Miss Stevens is ready for you now.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'll show you to her office.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Write this way.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Just watch your step here.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Okay.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
So it's pretty clear now,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
but there's still a couple of phrases

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
that I would like to look at.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
So why don't we look at the last two sentences?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Okay.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Miss Stevens is ready for you now.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Miss Stevens is ready for you now.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Miss Stevens is ready for you.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
So when she says ready for you,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
what does that mean?

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Prepared to speak to you.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Okay.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
So instead of saying Miss Stevens is ready

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
or Miss Stevens can see you now.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yes.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
You use this great little phrase.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Is ready for you.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Okay.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
And then she said,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I'll show you to her office.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I'll show you to her office.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I'll show you to her office.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
This is a lovely way of saying

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I will take you to the office.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I'll take you to the office.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
And she followed it by saying,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
write this way.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Write this way.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Write this way.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
So again,

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
walk this way.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Walk this way.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Yes.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Write this way.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
It sounds really, really nice.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Really polite, really welcoming.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Right.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
And especially if you use it together.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I'll show you to her office.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Write this way.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Yes.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Okay.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
So it's a really great way of being polite

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
to somebody at an office.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Now the final useful phrase.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Watch your step.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Watch your step.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Watch your step.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
So watch your step.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
You see that everywhere.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Be careful.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Be careful where you step.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yes.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Be careful where you're walking.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Okay.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
So obviously she didn't watch her step.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
And she fell.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
She fell.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Okay.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
So really great phrases.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Good afternoon.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
May I help you?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yes.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I have an appointment at four.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Certainly.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
May I take your name.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I'll let her know you've arrived.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Sure.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
It's Josh O'Neal.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Miss Stevens will be with you momentarily.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Can I offer you something to drink?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yes.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Coffee would be nice.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Thank you.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Here you are.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Miss Stevens is ready for you now.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I'll show you to her office.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Write this way.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Just watch your step here.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Alright.

08:19.000 --> 08:30.000
So a really simple dialogue, but with a lot of good phrases in there.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
And it's also a good review for more advanced students, right?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
Remember, like these phrases can really help you sound more professional and more welcoming.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
More polite, basically.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Okay.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
