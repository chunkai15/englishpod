00:00.000 --> 00:07.320
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us here at English Pod,

00:07.320 --> 00:08.320
my name is Marco.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.320
And I'm Erica.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.920
And today we're going to be talking about physics.

00:11.920 --> 00:12.920
That's right.

00:12.920 --> 00:17.280
And advanced lesson for all you physics lovers out there and even for those of you who

00:17.280 --> 00:20.560
maybe don't love physics so much, there's still some great language here.

00:20.560 --> 00:25.000
Right, we're going to be talking about the big bang theory, a very popular theory of

00:25.000 --> 00:30.360
how the universe or the world and how we came upon being created.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
That's right.

00:31.360 --> 00:35.440
So we've got some physics language, but we've also got some really tough words that I bet

00:35.440 --> 00:39.680
many of our users have never seen before, which we're going to look at those in this lesson.

00:39.680 --> 00:44.720
Alright, so why don't we get started with this great and interesting lesson and let's listen

00:44.720 --> 00:49.440
to the dialogue for the first time.

00:49.440 --> 00:54.720
What's up, you don't look too good?

00:54.720 --> 00:56.800
Yeah, my head hurts, that's all.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.760
I've been physics class all day, it's killer.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.360
I liked physics, it's all math really, arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.

01:03.360 --> 01:08.360
Yeah, yeah, but today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.

01:08.360 --> 01:12.200
A physics class about the creation of the universe, that's some pretty unscientific language

01:12.200 --> 01:13.960
there, sounds more religious to me.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.680
It's all religion.

01:15.680 --> 01:19.560
Make the theory of the big bang, how is it possible that all of the stuff the universe

01:19.560 --> 01:21.760
comes from an explosion?

01:21.760 --> 01:25.080
That's no better than atlas caring the globe and his back, or African myths about turtles

01:25.080 --> 01:26.080
and stuff?

01:26.080 --> 01:30.600
Turtles, whatever, look, all that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance

01:30.600 --> 01:33.920
of particles and antiparticles, at least that's what the math says.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.440
Math Schmath, what's the evidence?

01:36.440 --> 01:40.920
There is evidence, you know Edwin Hubble, the guy who in the early 20th century was the

01:40.920 --> 01:44.640
first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe.

01:44.640 --> 01:49.120
Us advancing notions of an expanding universe, what would it be expanding from?

01:49.120 --> 01:51.120
Well, the big bang, duh.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.560
Anyway, it's just a theory.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.440
Why people go around touting theories?

01:55.440 --> 01:57.000
Where's the rigor in that?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.600
Dude, don't equivocate.

01:58.600 --> 02:02.240
A theory only becomes a theory afterwithstanding rigorous testing.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.000
You slept through class, didn't you?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.120
Err, you're making my head hurt again.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.360
Quit with the question.

02:08.360 --> 02:15.880
Well, it sure does sound like a difficult class, doesn't it?

02:15.880 --> 02:20.840
It's a very interesting topic and very controversial, so there are many opinions on it.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.560
But before we get into that, why don't we take a look at some of those physics related

02:25.560 --> 02:30.920
words that we listen to in language takeaway?

02:30.920 --> 02:32.040
Language takeaway.

02:32.040 --> 02:36.600
We've got four words we've heard in the dialogue that are all related to physics, so let's

02:36.600 --> 02:40.520
start with the first one, which is matter matter.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.520
Matter.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.240
Okay, so you probably know this word from what's the matter, what's wrong?

02:45.240 --> 02:46.240
Yeah.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.720
In this case, we're talking about matter, so anything that occupies space that has

02:49.720 --> 02:54.360
a mass or that is related to energy, so matter.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.800
So all things in the world are made up of matter, right?

02:56.800 --> 02:57.800
Exactly.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.800
Okay.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.520
Now let's move on to another one.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.520
Particles.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.520
Particles.

03:03.520 --> 03:04.520
Particles.

03:04.520 --> 03:09.600
Particles are a little bit more, it's now particles are a little bit easier.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.800
They're just very small pieces of a hole.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.280
An apple is made up of apple particles, something like that.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.760
You can, if you want to understand it easily, yeah, apple has many small particles that

03:20.760 --> 03:22.440
make up the apple.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.440
So like, let's paint a picture here.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.920
The matter, you've got a beach and all the pieces of sand are particles of the beach.

03:28.920 --> 03:29.920
Exactly.

03:29.920 --> 03:30.920
Very good.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.800
So those are particles.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.360
Now the next one is a little bit difficult for me, I don't understand this.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.360
Anti-particles.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.360
All right.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.080
So anti-particles.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.080
Anti-particles.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.720
Now this, this prefix, anti.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.040
It means something that is against, right?

03:46.040 --> 03:47.040
Right.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.040
I've seen this one in anti-clockwise.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.040
All right.

03:50.040 --> 03:53.400
So anti-particles are those that are against particle.

03:53.400 --> 03:59.080
So basically, if you have a particle that has a positive charge, and another one comes

03:59.080 --> 04:03.920
in with a negative charge in the same weight and the same type of particle, if they get

04:03.920 --> 04:07.600
together, they cancel each other out and they both die.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.240
Oh, so that's an anti-particle.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.240
All right.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.160
Well, you heard it for a steering-glush hot.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.080
So anti-particles are not a good thing to have around.

04:17.080 --> 04:20.560
Now we also heard them talk about the drift of matter.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.560
Right.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.560
Drift of matter.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.560
Drift of matter.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.560
Also sometimes called drift of dark matter.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.560
Okay.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.320
Well, I know the verb to drift, right?

04:30.320 --> 04:32.520
To sort of float away on the sea.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.520
Right.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.800
If you have a little ship, you leave it on the beach.

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
It'll drift away.

04:36.800 --> 04:37.800
It'll go slowly away.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
Yeah.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.320
But what about drift of matter?

04:40.320 --> 04:46.240
So basically, the drift of matter is this residue, the remains of the big bang of the

04:46.240 --> 04:47.240
explosion.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.240
Okay.

04:48.240 --> 04:52.840
So matter and radiation keeps on drifting through the universe.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.640
So it's moving slowly through the universe.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.640
Moving slowly.

04:55.640 --> 05:00.560
So this big explosion and just consider it to be like this ripple and it's expanding

05:00.560 --> 05:01.560
and expanding.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.560
That's the drift of matter.

05:02.560 --> 05:03.560
All right.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.960
Well, I learned something else today.

05:05.960 --> 05:10.200
Some very specific words related to physics, but it's very interesting once you get

05:10.200 --> 05:14.680
into reading about these things, it will help you to understand it better.

05:14.680 --> 05:15.680
That's right.

05:15.680 --> 05:20.760
But we've also got some non-physics related language that we want to look at now in

05:20.760 --> 05:23.600
language takeaway, part two.

05:24.160 --> 05:24.600
Yeah.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.600
Yes.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.600
No.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.600
No.

05:27.600 --> 05:33.280
So we're talking about the drift of matter and how it's drifting through the universe.

05:33.280 --> 05:38.120
And he said thus advancing the notions of an expanding universe.

05:38.120 --> 05:43.400
So I want to look at the phrase, thus advancing notions, thus advancing notions, thus advancing

05:43.400 --> 05:44.400
notions.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.400
Okay.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.400
Let's start with the first word here.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.400
Thus.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.400
Okay.

05:48.400 --> 05:53.400
So this is a good connector or conjunction or conjunction and basically it means

05:53.440 --> 05:56.480
therefore, therefore, or in consequence, right?

05:56.480 --> 05:59.000
So thus advancing notions.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.600
Now, notions are ideas.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.600
Right.

06:02.600 --> 06:09.200
And so when you advance notions or advance ideas, you help to make progress.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.880
You help them go forward and become known.

06:11.880 --> 06:12.880
Okay.

06:12.880 --> 06:17.960
So in order to understand this in the context, they are saying that the drift of

06:17.960 --> 06:21.960
matter, thus advances notions of an expanding universe.

06:21.960 --> 06:26.160
So it is making progress to people believing that the universe is getting bigger.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.160
Okay.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.160
So interesting phrase.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.760
Now, I really like this word, thus.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.760
And a lot of people are afraid to use it.

06:33.760 --> 06:38.960
So why don't we hear a few examples of how it's used in context?

06:38.960 --> 06:42.040
Example one.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.960
So you can see that we've studied the fossil record and thus we can conclude that evolution

06:45.960 --> 06:46.960
is a fact.

06:48.960 --> 06:52.960
Example two.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.960
He broke severe company policies.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.960
Thus we had to fire him.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.960
Example three.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.960
I did not receive the documents on time.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.960
Thus I was unable to send them to you.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.960
All right.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.960
Good examples of thus.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.960
And I guess now we can use it a little bit better.

07:11.960 --> 07:12.960
That's right.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.960
Now let's move on to our next word.

07:14.960 --> 07:19.960
So they were talking about people who go around touting theories.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.960
Taute.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.960
To tout.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.960
Okay.

07:23.960 --> 07:24.960
So what does this mean?

07:24.960 --> 07:25.960
Taute.

07:25.960 --> 07:30.960
Well, basically when you tout something, you talk about it in a positive way.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.960
So as to almost like sell that thing.

07:33.960 --> 07:34.960
Okay.

07:34.960 --> 07:39.960
So for example, we can say the company is touting the many benefits of its product.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.960
Okay.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.960
Very good.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
So to talk positively about something.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.960
Okay.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.960
What the idea of trying to sell that thing or make people buy into it or believe it.

07:46.960 --> 07:47.960
All right.

07:47.960 --> 07:48.960
Very good.

07:48.960 --> 07:49.960
What about our next word?

07:49.960 --> 07:52.960
Well, we heard two related words in the dialogue.

07:52.960 --> 07:59.960
They were talking about where's the rigor in these theories and rigorous testing.

07:59.960 --> 08:00.960
Okay.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.960
So what's the difference between rigor and rigorist?

08:02.960 --> 08:07.960
Rigor is the state of being very clear and careful and exact.

08:07.960 --> 08:08.960
Okay.

08:08.960 --> 08:09.960
Very good.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.960
So rigorous is just the adjective clear, careful, attention to detail and exact.

08:14.960 --> 08:15.960
Okay.

08:15.960 --> 08:16.960
Very good.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.960
So rigorous training.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.960
I'm going over my notes in rigorous detail.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
Okay.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.960
Very good.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.960
And now we have one more word today in language takeaway.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.960
And that is equivocates.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.960
So we heard do that don't equivocates.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
Don't equivocates.

08:32.960 --> 08:33.960
Don't equivocates.

08:33.960 --> 08:34.960
All right.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.960
So what does he mean by this?

08:37.960 --> 08:42.960
Well, when you equivocate, you use big words to try and mislead somebody.

08:42.960 --> 08:43.960
Okay.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.960
So using big words to confuse or to mislead.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.960
Yep.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.960
So for example, we could say the job can to get it.

08:51.960 --> 08:56.960
We could say when asked about his experience, the job candidate equivocated.

08:56.960 --> 08:57.960
Okay.

08:57.960 --> 09:03.960
Or even the presidential nominee did not equivocate when he explained his tax policy.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.960
All right.

09:04.960 --> 09:10.960
So some good examples, good phrases, a lot of interesting stuff and a little bit more educational podcast today.

09:10.960 --> 09:11.960
That's right.

09:11.960 --> 09:22.960
So let's continue with our education by listening to the dialogue one last time.

09:22.960 --> 09:23.960
What's up?

09:23.960 --> 09:24.960
You don't look too good.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
Yeah.

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
My head hurts.

09:26.960 --> 09:27.960
That's all.

09:27.960 --> 09:28.960
I've been a physics class all day.

09:28.960 --> 09:29.960
It's killer.

09:29.960 --> 09:30.960
I like physics.

09:30.960 --> 09:31.960
It's all math really.

09:31.960 --> 09:32.960
Arc's curves velocity.

09:32.960 --> 09:33.960
Cool stuff.

09:33.960 --> 09:34.960
Yeah, yeah.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.960
But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.960
A physics class about the creation of the universe.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.960
That's some pretty unscientific language there.

09:42.960 --> 09:43.960
Sounds more religious to me.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.960
It's all religion.

09:45.960 --> 09:46.960
Take the theory of the big bang.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.960
How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

09:50.960 --> 09:55.960
That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe and his back or African myths about turtles and stuff?

09:55.960 --> 09:56.960
Turtles, whatever.

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
Look.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.960
All that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance of particles and antiparticles.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
At least that's what the math says.

10:03.960 --> 10:04.960
Math Schmath.

10:04.960 --> 10:05.960
What's the evidence?

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960
There is evidence.

10:07.960 --> 10:08.960
You know Edwin Hubble.

10:08.960 --> 10:13.960
The guy who in the early 20th century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter

10:13.960 --> 10:14.960
in the universe.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.960
Thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.960
What would it be expanding from?

10:18.960 --> 10:20.960
Well, the big bang, duh.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.960
Anyway, it's just a theory.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.960
Why do people go around touting theories?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.960
Where's the rigor in that?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.960
Dude, don't equivocate.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.960
A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.960
You slept through class, didn't you?

10:33.960 --> 10:35.960
You're making my head hurt again.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.960
Quit with a question.

10:41.960 --> 10:46.960
Alright, so the big bang theory, very controversial in some schools in the United States.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.960
They have prohibited the teachers from teaching it.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.960
I know, which is seems quite interesting to me.

10:52.960 --> 10:58.960
But it is actually very controversial and people can get really, really upset about this in America.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.960
So it is an interesting topic.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.960
Take it from the point of view of just something else.

11:03.960 --> 11:08.960
Maybe just to learn a little bit more about this topic, such as physics, right?

11:08.960 --> 11:09.960
Right.

11:09.960 --> 11:14.960
But there's something that is uncontroversial that I did want to talk about now that we heard in the dialogue.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.960
There's a lot of really interesting sort of slang words here in the dialogue, isn't there?

11:18.960 --> 11:21.960
Yeah, we heard in the first part of the dialogue when he said,

11:21.960 --> 11:24.960
I've been in physics class all day.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.960
Killer.

11:25.960 --> 11:26.960
Killer.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.960
So what does he mean by killer?

11:27.960 --> 11:29.960
Oh, he's just basically saying it's really hard.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.960
You know, it's like it's so difficult that it's murderous.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.960
It was intense.

11:33.960 --> 11:34.960
Yep.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.960
But this way we can use positively as well, can't we?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.960
Yeah, I guess you could say that was a killer party.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.960
Yeah, killer moves on the dance floor.

11:40.960 --> 11:41.960
Okay.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.960
Another interesting thing is that he said, map, schmath.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.960
Now, schmath isn't really a word.

11:47.960 --> 11:52.960
But this is a really common structure we use in English when we want to sort of take away

11:52.960 --> 11:54.960
from the importance of an idea.

11:54.960 --> 11:55.960
Okay.

11:55.960 --> 11:56.960
So you're saying it's not important.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.960
I don't care about it or it's not worth it.

11:59.960 --> 12:00.960
Yeah.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.960
So for example, I'm on a diet.

12:02.960 --> 12:03.960
Right.

12:03.960 --> 12:04.960
And I would say diet schmeyer.

12:04.960 --> 12:05.960
Yeah.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.960
So basically the structure is just added s h and then just kind of make it rhyme.

12:09.960 --> 12:10.960
Yeah.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.960
Schmeyer or like, like, work schmerk.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.960
Yeah, work schmerk or something like that.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.960
So you're just making fun of it and you're taking away importance.

12:18.960 --> 12:19.960
Yeah.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.960
That's a pretty neat phrase and one more.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.960
We heard them say duh, duh.

12:26.960 --> 12:30.960
So when we say this, we're just saying like, you should know this stupid.

12:30.960 --> 12:31.960
Yeah, this is obvious.

12:31.960 --> 12:32.960
Yep.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.960
It's kind of making fun of the person.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.960
Yeah.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.960
Just saying it's so obvious how can you not know it.

12:37.960 --> 12:38.960
Yeah.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.960
And it always goes either at the beginning or at the end of a sentence.

12:41.960 --> 12:42.960
Yeah.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.960
So duh, Marco, we're recording podcasts.

12:44.960 --> 12:45.960
Right.

12:45.960 --> 12:46.960
Very good.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.960
So some great words and phrases in this dialogue and a little bit of slang as well.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.960
So you can use it maybe with your friends.

12:53.960 --> 12:54.960
That's right.

12:54.960 --> 12:58.960
If you have any questions about the language in this dialogue or any thoughts on physics or the

12:58.960 --> 13:02.960
Big Bang Theory, come and check out our website at EnglishPod.com.

13:02.960 --> 13:03.960
All right.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.960
We'll see you guys there and until next time.

13:05.960 --> 13:06.960
Goodbye.
