00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Hello English learners, welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod

00:06.400 --> 00:07.400
of my name is Marco.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.400
And I'm Erica.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.200
And today we have an advanced lesson for all of you and a very good one because we're

00:12.200 --> 00:16.400
going to be talking about the very serious topic, global warming.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.400
That's right.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.000
And even though most people agree that global warming is a big problem, there's still

00:22.000 --> 00:27.200
this sort of fringe element of people who believe that actually a global warming doesn't

00:27.200 --> 00:28.200
exist.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.200
Exactly.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.520
So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

00:30.520 --> 00:34.600
But before we tell you more or less what the dialogue is about, let's take a look at some

00:34.600 --> 00:36.200
words in vocabulary preview.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.200
Very vocabulary preview.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.320
We're going to look at two words here and you'll hear both of these in the dialogue.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.960
So the first one is polar ice caps.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.280
Polar ice caps.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
Polar ice caps.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.720
So when we talk about polar ice caps, polar is like the poles, the north and south poles

00:55.720 --> 00:56.720
of the earth.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.920
The extreme, the top and bottom, the top and bottom of the planet.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.920
Yep.

01:00.920 --> 01:01.920
Okay.

01:01.920 --> 01:02.920
And what about ice caps?

01:02.920 --> 01:10.040
So the polar ice caps are masses of ice that that live or that exist on the top

01:10.040 --> 01:11.840
and the bottom of the world.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.240
We have these big chunks of ice that are on the top at the bottom of the planet.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.240
Yes.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.240
They're all year round.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.240
Okay.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.560
So these are the polar ice caps.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.560
What about our next word?

01:20.560 --> 01:25.720
Well, next word is endangered species and endangered species.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.720
Okay.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.720
So endangered species.

01:29.720 --> 01:34.720
It's a type of animal that is at risk of completely dying out.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.720
Okay.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.720
So it's not completely extinct.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.720
Right.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
So it's a danger.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
Okay.

01:40.720 --> 01:41.720
In danger of.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
Yeah.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.720
So an example of endangered species would be the Bengal tigers.

01:46.720 --> 01:47.720
Okay.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.720
The tigers or the pandas, right?

01:49.720 --> 01:50.720
Or maybe gorillas.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
Right.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.720
So all of these animals, they're very few of them left in the world.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.720
So they are endangered species.

01:56.720 --> 01:57.720
Okay.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.240
So with that, I think we're just about ready to turn to our dialogue.

02:01.240 --> 02:07.040
Now here are going to learn a lot of language that you can use when you want to make an argument

02:07.040 --> 02:10.520
or express your point of view in a very sort of academic way.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.840
But Markle, what are we arguing about here?

02:12.840 --> 02:17.360
So we're going to listen as a college professor is lecturing about global warming and well,

02:17.360 --> 02:20.280
one of the students doesn't really agree with what he's saying.

02:24.720 --> 02:36.720
And therefore global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century.

02:36.720 --> 02:37.720
Questions?

02:37.720 --> 02:38.720
Uh, yeah.

02:38.720 --> 02:43.120
In the lecture, you said there's more evidence in the scientific record supporting global

02:43.120 --> 02:44.120
cooling?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.120
Well, yes.

02:45.120 --> 02:49.840
Essentially, the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles warming and cooling

02:49.840 --> 02:52.840
are cooperating processes in the planetary ecosystem.

02:52.840 --> 02:57.000
If that's true, and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the

02:57.000 --> 03:01.240
polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?

03:01.240 --> 03:04.280
But are global temperatures rising?

03:04.280 --> 03:08.360
If you look at the data from 1975, you'll be misled.

03:08.360 --> 03:12.480
If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s, then you would

03:12.480 --> 03:16.480
see how dramatically the Earth's temperature has changed.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.880
Young lady, I'd beg to differ.

03:17.880 --> 03:22.280
Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there's evidence for both sides.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.920
And I'm putting forth the argument that there's greater evidence in support of the global

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
cooling hypothesis.

03:26.920 --> 03:32.640
Look, it's an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into

03:32.640 --> 03:35.680
believing that there's some kind of climate crisis.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.320
This scare mongering is done quite simply for political reasons.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.720
But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contribute

03:43.720 --> 03:48.400
to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?

03:48.400 --> 03:53.480
Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.

03:53.480 --> 03:59.000
Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species, and investing in renewable energy.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.400
At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence

04:03.400 --> 04:04.840
on foreign oil.

04:04.840 --> 04:09.840
Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.840
I've never been so disrespected in all of my days.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.640
I'm a professor, a scientist, and a researcher of high regard.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.360
Yeah, and a deplicitous one at that.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.960
Everyone knows you're in the pocket of the oil lobby.

04:22.960 --> 04:27.400
Why should we trust your so-called findings more than tobacco institute studies, which

04:27.400 --> 04:29.360
says smoking doesn't harm health?

04:29.360 --> 04:31.080
You're full of it.

04:31.080 --> 04:40.240
Some people just cannot handle civil debate.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.680
All right, so apparently this college professor is a not very truthful in what he's saying,

04:45.680 --> 04:46.680
right?

04:46.720 --> 04:52.600
Yeah, maybe he believes it, but I certainly have very strong and differing opinions.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.160
So that's the interesting part is that we heard a lot of language that she used to argue

04:57.160 --> 04:58.160
her point of view.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.600
So this is interesting, and we can start now looking at some of this language in language

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
takeaway.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.920
Language takeaway.

05:06.920 --> 05:11.200
So the college professor was arguing against this idea of global warming, and she said,

05:11.200 --> 05:14.160
look, it's an indisputable fact.

05:14.240 --> 05:18.040
Okay, and indisputable fact and indisputable fact.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.080
Okay, so let's break it down, and let's take a look at this word indisputable.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.200
You can't argue against it.

05:24.200 --> 05:28.800
Okay, so something indisputable is you can't argue with it, and will affect something

05:28.800 --> 05:29.800
that's true.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.080
Okay, so you can't argue with this, this piece of information.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.400
Yeah, all right, indisputable fact.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.280
So why don't we give a few examples?

05:37.280 --> 05:42.480
It's an indisputable fact that China is the most popular nation on earth.

05:42.520 --> 05:43.840
Okay, exactly.

05:43.840 --> 05:48.880
Or it's an indisputable fact that English pod is the best podcast out there.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.880
Indeed, it is indisputable.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.360
All right, so indisputable fact.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.760
And what about our next word?

05:54.760 --> 05:59.520
Well, the student accused the professor of scaremongering.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.760
Scaremongering.

06:00.760 --> 06:01.960
Scaremongering.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.520
Okay, now this is kind of a strange word scaremongering.

06:05.520 --> 06:10.240
Yeah, and I think some examples will help us to understand the meaning a little bit better.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.440
Example one.

06:13.440 --> 06:20.560
Software flaws are not the same as virus attacks, and saying otherwise is just scaremongering.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.200
Example two.

06:23.200 --> 06:28.120
There's been a lot of scaremongering caused by the rumor that mobile phones cause cancer.

06:28.120 --> 06:33.440
Okay, so basically we understand that it's kind of putting fear in people's minds.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.920
Yeah, it's sort of like selling fear for your own benefit.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.720
Okay, so making people afraid for some objective or some purpose.

06:41.720 --> 06:46.040
Yeah, and you know, this word reminds me of the word a fishmonger.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.800
Okay, a fishmonger, what's that?

06:47.800 --> 06:49.960
Which is basically a seller of fish.

06:49.960 --> 06:53.720
So a scaremonger is a seller of fear.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.760
Okay, interesting.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.280
So now we have a way of remembering.

06:56.280 --> 06:56.920
Yes.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.120
Scaremongering.

06:58.120 --> 07:02.200
All right, and moving on to our next word, we have autocratic.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.640
Autocratic.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.640
An autocratic country.

07:05.800 --> 07:11.080
So an autocratic country is ruled by someone who holds total power.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.000
Okay, so we have an autocratic country.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.600
So basically we have a leader that that rules everything, right?

07:16.600 --> 07:17.400
Right.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.400
But we can apply it not only to a country, we can say a person is autocratic.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.480
Yeah, you could say, I can't stand my boss's autocratic leadership style.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.920
Or maybe a company.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.200
Mm-hmm.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.920
This company is a very autocratic organization.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.120
Okay, very good.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.720
And what about our last word?

07:33.800 --> 07:38.040
The student accused the professor of being duplicitous.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.480
Okay, so she said, he is duplicitous.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.760
Yes, duplicitous.

07:42.760 --> 07:43.960
All right, what does that mean?

07:43.960 --> 07:51.160
When you are duplicitous, you have behavior that is dishonest and is designed to trick people.

07:51.160 --> 07:54.680
Okay, so you're not a very honest person if you're duplicitous.

07:54.680 --> 07:59.160
Yeah, you're telling lies as a means of making people do something or tricking them.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.280
Okay, very good.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.960
So a duplicitous person or a duplicitous idea, maybe?

08:03.960 --> 08:04.440
Mm-hmm.

08:04.440 --> 08:08.920
Okay, all right, so these are all the words that we have on language takeaway today.

08:08.920 --> 08:15.240
But now let's move on to some very interesting phrases that we can use to put forward some arguments

08:15.240 --> 08:16.280
in fluency builder.

08:17.880 --> 08:18.840
Fluency builder.

08:19.880 --> 08:24.360
Okay, Marker, you actually just mentioned our first phrase, which is, I'm putting fourth

08:24.360 --> 08:26.040
the argument that.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.600
Okay, so putting fourth of the argument that.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.320
So if you put fourth in argument.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.280
You present it.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.360
You present it or you push it towards some areas.

08:34.360 --> 08:34.920
Yeah, give it.

08:34.920 --> 08:35.720
Uh-huh.

08:35.720 --> 08:39.240
So can we just put fourth in argument?

08:39.240 --> 08:42.920
Well, actually, you can put forth a lot of things like put forth a suggestion.

08:42.920 --> 08:46.040
Okay, I'm putting fourth a suggestion that we should get a new computer.

08:46.040 --> 08:46.920
Or an idea.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.960
Tim put forth the idea that we should go on vacation to Hawaii.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.920
Oh, good idea.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.040
All right, so you can put fourth many different things.

08:54.040 --> 08:58.200
So the professor obviously is putting fourth the argument that global warming is

08:59.080 --> 09:01.240
and the student obviously totally disagree.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.280
And she said, you have to concede that.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.560
Okay, you have to concede that.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.120
You have to concede that.

09:10.120 --> 09:14.280
All right, so this word concede or you have to concede.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.400
Why don't we listen to some examples before we listen to the meaning?

09:18.360 --> 09:19.240
Example one.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.120
I'm sorry, but I can concede with you on this point.

09:26.040 --> 09:26.760
Example two.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.320
Julie conceded that she might have forgotten her sister's birthday.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.720
Example three.

09:36.280 --> 09:39.960
Both philosophers conceded that there are philosophies have some errors.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.440
Okay, so you have to concede that.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.480
Basically, you have to agree that this one point in my argument is true.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.160
Maybe you're arguing many different points with somebody, but you tell them,

09:55.240 --> 09:58.120
well, you have to concede that the earth is round.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.680
Okay, so that part I can't argue with.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.400
That's really true.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.600
Okay, very good.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.640
So concede.

10:04.440 --> 10:10.920
Now, at the end of the dialogue, the student accused the professor of being in the pocket of the oil

10:10.920 --> 10:11.560
lobby.

10:11.560 --> 10:16.440
Okay, so he's in the pocket of to be in the pocket of.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.480
All right, so if I have somebody in my pocket, what does that mean?

10:19.480 --> 10:21.400
It means basically you're bribing them.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.280
Okay, so maybe I have the senator in my pocket.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.000
Okay, so obviously you're paying the senator to do what you want.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.160
Okay, very good, so it's another way.

10:29.160 --> 10:34.120
It's a very informal way of saying, I'm bribing somebody, or that person is being bribed.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.240
That's right, so why don't we move to our final phrase.

10:37.960 --> 10:43.240
And the student was talking about the professor's so called findings.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.200
Okay, so you're so called finding.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.720
So called.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.320
So this word so called.

10:50.040 --> 10:54.600
You use this word when you want to take away from the importance of an idea.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.080
Or, all right, so I use it before and now, right?

10:57.080 --> 11:00.200
Right, so for example, my so called friends.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.480
Okay, so these friends are not really your friends, maybe.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.520
So yeah, they're friends a name, but they don't act like friends.

11:06.520 --> 11:09.960
Okay, so you can say my so called job.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.160
Okay, so maybe you kind of go to work, but do nothing all day.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.800
Right, or maybe you don't even really like what you do.

11:16.520 --> 11:21.560
Right, so my so called job, my so called friends, or maybe my so called teacher.

11:21.560 --> 11:22.920
Okay, so this is a bad teacher.

11:22.920 --> 11:23.720
Exactly.

11:23.720 --> 11:27.160
So we use it a lot with many different nouns, right?

11:27.160 --> 11:30.760
That's right, so that's our last phrase for fluency builder.

11:30.760 --> 11:37.000
Now, I think it will help us to understand these words and phrases a little bit better to hear them again in context.

11:46.120 --> 11:53.240
And therefore global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century.

11:53.240 --> 11:53.960
Questions?

11:53.960 --> 11:59.640
Uh, yeah, and the lecture you said, there's more evidence in the scientific record supporting

11:59.640 --> 12:00.680
global cooling?

12:00.680 --> 12:06.680
Well, yes, essentially the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles, warming and cooling

12:06.680 --> 12:09.560
are cooperating processes in the planetary ecosystem.

12:09.560 --> 12:14.200
If that's true and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar

12:14.280 --> 12:17.800
ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?

12:17.800 --> 12:20.920
But our global temperatures rising.

12:20.920 --> 12:25.080
If you look at the data from 1975, you'll be misled.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.840
If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.200
Then you would see how dramatically the Earth's temperature has changed.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.600
Young lady, I'd beg to differ.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.920
Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there's evidence for both sides.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.760
And I'm putting forth the argument that there's greater evidence in support of the global

12:42.760 --> 12:43.880
cooling hypothesis.

12:43.880 --> 12:49.080
Look, it's an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared

12:49.080 --> 12:52.440
into believing that there's some kind of climate crisis.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.040
This scare mongering is done quite simply for political reasons.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.040
But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide

13:00.040 --> 13:04.200
contribute to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?

13:05.080 --> 13:10.360
Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.

13:10.360 --> 13:15.720
Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species, and investing in renewable energy.

13:15.720 --> 13:20.200
At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence

13:20.200 --> 13:21.480
on foreign oil.

13:21.480 --> 13:26.360
Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.

13:26.360 --> 13:30.760
I've never been so disrespected in all of my days.

13:30.760 --> 13:34.360
I'm a professor, a scientist, and a researcher of high regard.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.920
Yeah, and the deplicitous one at that.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.720
Everyone knows you're in the pocket of the oil lobby.

13:39.720 --> 13:43.960
Why should we trust your so-called findings more than to back-o-institutes studies,

13:43.960 --> 13:46.040
which says smoking doesn't harm health.

13:46.040 --> 13:46.760
You're full of it.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.720
Some people just cannot handle civil debate.

13:58.600 --> 13:59.720
All right, very good.

13:59.720 --> 14:04.200
So, interesting ways of putting forth arguments and, well,

14:04.280 --> 14:06.920
it's an interesting topic and very controversial, right?

14:06.920 --> 14:12.360
That's right, but what I noticed in this dialogue is that the student was pretty

14:12.360 --> 14:16.440
assertive in putting forth her argument and standing up to the teacher.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.120
Right, she argued with a teacher a lot.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.720
And this is interesting because it's a very cultural aspect, I think, right?

14:21.720 --> 14:27.640
Yeah, in North American universities, there is this idea that it's really important to

14:28.600 --> 14:35.160
think critically and to argue against different ideas and to, you know, to really speak up when you

14:35.160 --> 14:36.280
don't agree with something.

14:36.280 --> 14:40.280
Right, so basically, there's this culture of questioning, not only what you're being taught,

14:40.280 --> 14:41.720
but you can also question the teacher.

14:41.720 --> 14:45.240
You don't actually have to believe everything that the teacher is saying.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.600
Exactly, and actually, I think this situation is really interesting.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.640
You know, you always go to these lectures and there's always a question and answer

14:51.640 --> 14:53.160
period at the end of the lectures.

14:53.400 --> 14:58.360
And I think that there's like this group of sort of academically minded people who

14:59.480 --> 15:04.280
feel like it's really cool to ask these really difficult questions and engage in arguments with

15:04.280 --> 15:05.080
the props.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.520
Yeah, yeah, that's really true.

15:06.520 --> 15:10.600
But actually, she used a lot of polite language and a lot of polite ways of actually

15:10.600 --> 15:11.880
arguing with the professor.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.760
Yeah, until the last point when she said, you're full of it.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.040
Yeah, you're full of it.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.080
Right, you're full of it.

15:17.080 --> 15:21.000
So what she's saying here, all right, she's basically saying that you're full of shit.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.680
Marco.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.920
So yeah, you wouldn't really say that.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.920
So to be a little bit less rude, you would just say you're full of it.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.160
Yeah, but that is one step too far.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.720
I think this would be considered a little bit rude.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.160
Yeah, for a professor, yeah.

15:35.160 --> 15:39.800
But I guess if you don't believe what your friend is telling you or maybe

15:39.800 --> 15:41.960
he's exaggerating, you can say, oh, you're full of it.

15:41.960 --> 15:42.920
Yeah, okay.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.880
So some great argumentative language here in this dialogue.

15:45.880 --> 15:49.640
But we want to give you an opportunity to try out some of this language.
