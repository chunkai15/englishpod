00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello English learners. Welcome back. We are here at EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
And I'm Erica. And today we're going to be bringing you a lesson about eggs. That's right.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
And who knew there was so much to talk about when we're talking eggs.

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
We always have eggs for breakfast and there are many ways of preparing them. So we're going to learn what the different ways are.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
Yes. And we'll learn some of the language that goes along with eggs.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Okay. So we have three words that we want to take a look at before we listen to a dialogue.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
So let's look at these in vocabulary preview.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
Very vocabulary preview. Our preview word for this lesson is picky, picky, picky, picky.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
So picky is an interesting adjective.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Okay. So if a person is picky, what does that mean?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
They're very hard to please.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
Okay. So if your boss is picky and you give him a report and maybe it has, I don't know.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I don't know. A couple of mistakes or something.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah. He'll say do it again.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Can this, this and this. Okay.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
So if you are picky, you want everything to be perfect.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Okay. And if there's one small thing that's not, you won't, you won't be happy.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Okay. So picky, interesting word.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Now our next word, yoke, yoke, yoke, y-o-l-k, yoke.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
So this word is actually not in the dialogue.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
It's not in the dialogue, but it's important that you know, right?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
Okay. So if you have an egg, the yellow part is called the yoke.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Okay. And what about the other part?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
The white, the white.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Or also called the egg white, right?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Yes. Egg white.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay. So pretty simple. Yoke and egg white.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Let's listen to our dialogue.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
We are going to be listening to a couple who are having breakfast.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Wow. You're up early today. What's your breakfast?

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Well, I felt like baking, so I made some muffins.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Smells good. I'll make some coffee.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Sure. I'll take mine, sunny side up.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Ever since I was small, I've had eggs and soldiers.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
It drove my mom crazy.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You know what really drives me crazy?

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
When I asked for soft boiled eggs and they overcook them so they come out hard boiled.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Here's so picky sometimes.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Here you go honey, fried eggs.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Damn it.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
I said sunny side up. How many times do I have to tell you?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Well, she is definitely very picky and has a very bad temper.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
I know. I can't believe anyone would get so angry over their breakfast.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
But I guess it is the most important meal of the day.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Exactly.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
So we heard a couple of different ways of describing how you prepare eggs.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
So let's take a look at that in language takeaway.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Language takeaway.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Okay, so our first preparation method.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
My favorite.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Sunny side up.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Sunny side up.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Sunny side up.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Now this is interesting sunny like the sun, right?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Exactly.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
So when you fry an egg, right?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And the yolk looks like a little sun, right?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah, exactly.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
So why is it called Sunny side up?

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I think because of what you just said it looks like the sun.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
But you don't cook the yolk, right?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
The yolk is still yellow.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
It's still a little bit liquid.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
It's a little bit soft.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Okay, because the opposite would be a fried egg.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yes.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And that's our second word.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Fried egg.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes, you put the egg in the pan and you cook it all the way through.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
All the way through.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So the yolk is not liquid anymore.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
It becomes hard.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Exactly.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Okay.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
A fried egg.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
All right.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
So now let's take a look at our next set of eggs.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
All right.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Soft boiled egg.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
A soft boiled egg.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Soft boiled.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Soft boiled.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
So to boil, you put the egg in water.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
And boiling water.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yes.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
And make it cook.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
So how long would you usually put it in for to be soft boiled?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Three minutes.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Four minutes.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Okay.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
So you only cook part of the egg, right?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Right.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
The yolk, the yellow part, stays a little bit wet, a little bit liquid.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Uh-huh.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Okay.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
So again, the opposite would be a hard boiled egg.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Hard boiled egg.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Hard boiled.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
So hard boiled is when you cook the entire egg again.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yes.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
So then it's hard like a ball.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
The entire egg.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
So with this soft boiled and hard boiled eggs, this takes us to our next form.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Eggs and soldiers.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Eggs and soldiers.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Eggs and soldiers.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Eggs and soldiers.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Now this is really interesting.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I didn't really know about this before.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
It kind of sounds like you're having eggs with a group of soldiers with from the army.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Well, this is a very British way of eating eggs.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
So you have your soft boiled egg in a cup.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
And you have a piece of toast.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
But the toast is cut into long pieces.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Okay.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
And then you take those pieces and you dip them into the egg yolk.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Delicious.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
It's good.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Typical English way of eating eggs.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Okay.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
So eggs and soldiers are interesting.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
And this takes us to our last form of egg preparation and probably the most popular.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yes.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Scramble eggs.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Scramble eggs.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Take eggs, put them in a pan.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
And then you just move them all over the place.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
We mix them all up.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Mix them all up.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
So the yellow, so the yolk and the white are mixed together.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Mix together.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
All right.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
So we've looked at a lot of egg preparation.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
And now we can listen to our dialogue for the second time.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
And then we'll come back and look at some phrases.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Wow.

06:27.000 --> 06:36.000
You're up early today.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
What's for breakfast?

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Well, I felt like baking.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So I made some muffins.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Smells good.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I'll make some coffee.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Sure.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I'll take mine.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Sunny side up.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Ever since I was small, I've had eggs and soldiers.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It drove my mom crazy.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
You know what really drives me crazy?

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
When I asked for soft boiled eggs and they overcook them so they come out hard boiled.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
You're so picky sometimes.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Here you go, honey.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Friday eggs.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Demit.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I said, Sunny side up.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
How many times do I have to tell you?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Interesting.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
The man in this dialogue is the one doing the baking.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, that's modern days.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I don't know.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Men are learning how to cook.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
How's husband?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah, more popular these days.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
All right.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Well, since this house has been felt like baking.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
I think we should look at this and one other phrase in fluency builder.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Okay.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
So great phrase.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
He said, I felt like baking.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I felt like baking.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I felt like baking.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
So let's take a look at this.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
He feels like or he felt like in the past.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
What does that mean when you feel like?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
You want to do it.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
You have the desire to do it.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
And then to bake.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
And now this verb is in the gerend form.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
That's right.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
The ING form.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
And that's the rule, right?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
I feel like playing soccer.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Right.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I feel like eating lunch.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I felt like going to the movies.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
That's the way you would say this.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
You have the desire.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
You feel like doing something.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Exactly.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Okay.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Very good.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
And now let's take a look at this second phrase.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Drive me crazy.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Drive me crazy.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Drive me crazy.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
All right.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
This is a very descriptive phrase.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
And I think if we listen to some examples, it will help us understand the meaning.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Example one.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
This music is driving me crazy.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Turn it down.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Example two.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Don't leave garbage in my car.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
It drives me crazy.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Example three.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Your mom is driving me crazy.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
She keeps calling me.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
All right.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
So if something drives you crazy, it makes you feel very angry or annoyed.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Irritated.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Frustrated.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Okay.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
But it could also be positive, right?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Like that girl drives me crazy.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
As then you really, really like her.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
I don't know.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
It sounds a little bit inappropriate.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Really?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I think it's okay.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It drives me crazy.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
She's got me thinking.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
She's got me in the cloud or something like that.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
All right.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, maybe there's something about you that I don't need to know.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
So I'll just let you keep that thought to yourself.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
All right.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Well, I'm just saying we could use it in a positive format.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Okay.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
You're just saying.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
I'm just saying.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
All right.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
So drive me crazy.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Really great phrase.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
And you can use it in all of these different situations like we heard.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
Wow.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
You're up early today.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
What's your breakfast?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, I felt like baking.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
So I made some muffins.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Smells good.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
I'll make some coffee.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Sure.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
I'll take mine.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Sunny side off.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Ever since I was small, I've had eggs and soldiers.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It drove my mom crazy.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
You know what really drives me crazy?

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
When I asked for soft boiled eggs and they overcook them so they come out hard boiled.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Here's so picky sometimes.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Here you go, honey.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Fraud eggs.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Damn it.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I said, Sunny side up.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
How many times do I have to tell you?

11:21.000 --> 11:33.000
Well, I think there are some people who really, really love eating eggs for breakfast and some people who just can't stand it.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah, I don't know who though.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I mean, who doesn't like eggs in the morning?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm a big fan.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Right.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Eggs baked and toast.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yes.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Good stuff.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Traditional American type breakfast.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Now you were telling me that you have some traditions when you eat eggs.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
I know, I think I'm not sure if this is just in my family, but I think actually it might be common with other people as well.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
When you eat a soft boiled or hard boiled egg, you have to eat all of the egg outside of the shell.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
And then you have to break the bottom of the shell after you finished.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Why?

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
So that the fairies who live in your egg cup can come out.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
So it's kind of like a superstition.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, I guess it is.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
So I don't know.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
You guys, do you have any egg traditions or any other crazy food stories like that?

12:20.000 --> 12:29.000
Well, for example, I was telling you that when I prepare scrambled eggs, sometimes I like to take some rice.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Some rice that has already been cooked.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
Then the pan and then take some eggs to eggs, put it on top of the rice and scramble the rice with the eggs.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Okay, for breakfast.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah, it could be for breakfast.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Really?

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
A little bit, not like a huge plain rice or maybe at night.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
You don't have anything to eat.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Okay.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Scramble the eggs with rice.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
It's a poor man's food.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
All right.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Well, it's also a quick man's food.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah, exactly.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.640
