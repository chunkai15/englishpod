00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Hello English learners. Welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:04.800 --> 00:08.640
And I'm Erica. And today we have a very special guest in our studio,

00:08.640 --> 00:10.800
Danny. Hi everyone, Danny.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.360
Danny is part of our EnglishPod team and today she's going to help us with this

00:15.360 --> 00:19.600
Chinese New Year's lesson. It's an intermediate lesson, but it has a lot of cultural

00:19.600 --> 00:24.080
aspects about Chinese New Year. So that's what Danny's going to help us out with today.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.800
Yes, today we're going to learn a little bit about Chinese New Year in English.

00:28.880 --> 00:33.840
And we're also going to learn some language for describing things that we're excited about.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.240
Okay, yeah, I'm excited to hear the show.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.240
Okay, so let's listen to the dialogue now and then when we come back we'll explain everything.

00:47.600 --> 00:53.280
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year. When do I get to visit Grimma? Grimma makes the best

00:53.280 --> 00:54.480
dumplings in the world.

00:55.440 --> 01:00.400
Right, sounds to me like you're more excited about dumplings than seeing a grandma.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.560
Of course I miss Grimma too. I bet she's going to teach me how to play magic on.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.600
Hey, Dad, are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

01:07.600 --> 01:11.360
We're going to have the best fireworks. I'm really looking forward to letting them.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.280
Son, firecrackers aren't toys. They are dangerous.

01:15.280 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, fireworks are awesome.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.800
Wow, don't you remember? Last year when I set up the firecrackers,

01:22.880 --> 01:25.680
you covered both your ears and hit behind your mother.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.360
And I was scared because I saw a bug. That's all.

01:30.480 --> 01:30.880
Really?

01:31.600 --> 01:34.640
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.720
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

01:36.720 --> 01:38.880
Hey, I offered last year.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.160
Well, I, anyways, I was just thinking of the red end loops.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.360
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red end loop money.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.000
I can't wait. I'm going to have so much money.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.480
Mom, can I get up 10 in a piece of paper?

01:50.560 --> 01:52.800
I want a new transformer. No, two transformers.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.480
That must be right. You're Jack.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.760
Look at a PSP game.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.760
Oh, oh, I need it.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.760
Okay, so Chinese New Year. A lot of exciting vocabulary here.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.400
Right.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.360
Before we get into describing it, let's look at the vocabulary that we saw in language takeaway.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.920
Language takeaway.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.760
The first word on language takeaway. Dumplings.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.040
Dumplings.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.000
Dumplings.

02:26.000 --> 02:26.640
Dumplings.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.440
Well, in Chinese, we call it Shreytel.

02:30.480 --> 02:34.160
And it's a very traditional Chinese food and it's getting very famous now.

02:35.200 --> 02:41.520
Yes, so it's basically small pieces of dough with maybe some meat or some vegetables inside.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.040
And then they are boiled.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.640
Usually in a soup, in a soup, but you can also have fried dumpling.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.400
Yeah, yeah, that's really good.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.800
So, if you know Italian food, they're really similar to a tortellini.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.080
Not exactly.

02:54.080 --> 02:58.000
Or in Latin America, it's very similar to maybe in Empanada.

02:58.000 --> 02:58.400
All right.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.000
A small little Empanada.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.560
Marco, what's our next word?

03:02.560 --> 03:05.040
All right, our next word, firecrackers.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.640
Firecrackers.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.840
Firecrackers.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.720
Firecrackers.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.280
This is a firecracker.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.800
Firecrackers are so common in China.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.960
We use it all the time in all occasions.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.600
Yep.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.440
And especially on the New Year's Eve,

03:26.640 --> 03:30.240
traditionally, people use it to scare off the evil.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.120
Evil spirits.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.080
The evil spirits.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.360
Yeah, okay.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.680
So on Chinese New Year, there are millions of firecrackers.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.800
Millions of firecrackers.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.280
Yeah.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.240
Now, there are also a lot of fireworks.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.200
Fireworks.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.400
Fireworks.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.120
Fireworks.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.720
So fireworks are similar to firecrackers.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.920
But they have lots of light.

03:49.920 --> 03:50.480
A light.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.200
Yeah.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.600
They go up in the air and explode.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.640
And you see lots of light.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.160
Beautiful colors.

03:56.160 --> 03:56.480
Yeah.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.360
Very popular in 4th of July in the United States.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.160
Or New Year's Eve.

04:00.160 --> 04:00.800
New Year's Eve.

04:02.000 --> 04:02.720
Fireworks.

04:03.280 --> 04:03.840
Okay.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.280
Now, let's look at our last word.

04:06.160 --> 04:06.720
Set off.

04:07.520 --> 04:08.560
Set off.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.520
Set off.

04:09.520 --> 04:10.160
Set off.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.360
So this is the verb you would use with firecrackers.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.600
Yeah, it means like explode the firecracker.

04:15.600 --> 04:15.920
Right.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.440
Set off the firecracker.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.720
Set off the bomb.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.000
Set off fireworks.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.320
Well, let's listen to our dialogue a second time.

04:22.320 --> 04:27.600
And this time, it'll be a little bit slower so that you can understand the language a bit better.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.560
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.960
When do I get to visit Grandma?

04:38.960 --> 04:41.840
Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.680
Ha ha, right.

04:43.680 --> 04:49.360
Sounds to me like you are more excited about dumplings than seeing your grandma.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.480
Of course, I miss Grandma too.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.840
I bet she's going to teach me how to play Majong.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.200
Hey, Dad.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.840
Are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

04:59.840 --> 05:02.160
We're going to have the best fireworks.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.720
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.760
So, firecrackers aren't toys.

05:07.760 --> 05:08.880
They're dangerous.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.920
No, fireworks are awesome.

05:11.920 --> 05:12.880
Whoa.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.320
Don't you remember?

05:14.320 --> 05:17.600
Last year, when I set off the firecrackers,

05:17.600 --> 05:21.840
you covered both your ears and hate behind your mother.

05:21.840 --> 05:25.680
Dad, I was scared because I saw a bug.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.320
That's all.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.760
Ha ha, really?

05:28.400 --> 05:31.680
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.000
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.560
Hey, I offered last year.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.320
Well, I...

05:38.320 --> 05:41.040
Anyways, I was just thinking of the red envelopes.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.560
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red envelope money.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.680
I can't wait.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.600
I'm going to have so much money.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.840
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

05:50.640 --> 05:52.160
I want a new transformer.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.000
No, two transformers.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.560
The Optimus Prime and made me the Wheeljack.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.000
I'll get a PSP game.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.360
Ha ha, and I'll buy the entire class, lunch and McDonald's.

06:02.240 --> 06:10.800
Okay, so we saw some really great phrases of describing excitement, right?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.800
So let's start with Fluency Builder.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.040
Fluency Builder.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.240
We have four phrases for you today.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.760
And the first one is, I'm so excited about it.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.440
I'm so excited about it.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.960
I'm so excited about it.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.480
So when you say, I'm so excited, it means that you are like,

06:28.480 --> 06:30.960
really happy that something is going to happen.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.640
Yeah, so happy you can't relax.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.840
Right, so you could say, I'm so excited about our vacation next month.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.640
I'm so excited about opening all my presents.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.960
Exactly, so excited.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.200
Now we also saw another really great word.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.880
Very similar to I'm so excited.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.840
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.240
I'm really looking forward to.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.240
I'm really looking forward to.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.320
I'm really looking forward to.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.280
So this is a little bit less than excited, right?

06:59.280 --> 07:00.400
A bit less strong.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.040
Right.

07:01.040 --> 07:06.240
So you would say, oh, I'm really looking forward to meeting your new girlfriend.

07:06.240 --> 07:10.080
Or you can say, I'm really looking forward to seeing that movie.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.200
Exactly.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.560
So it means you're a little bit excited, but not so excited.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.760
Yeah, you're happy about something that's going to happen in the future.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.360
Now let's look at our next phrase and it's very similar to excited.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.280
I can't wait.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.720
I can't wait.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.080
I can't wait.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.200
I can't wait.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.160
So this is very, very similar to I'm so excited.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.280
Yes, when you're so excited for something, you can't wait for it.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.080
Let's listen to some more examples of I can't wait.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.080
Example one.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.680
I'm so excited.

07:41.680 --> 07:42.800
I can't wait to see you.

07:46.960 --> 07:47.680
Example two.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.840
Hmm, smells delicious.

07:53.840 --> 07:54.960
I can't wait for dinner.

07:54.960 --> 08:00.720
Example three.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.480
I can't wait to open my presence.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.840
So we can use it again the same way.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.640
I can't wait to go on vacation next month.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.640
I can't wait to open all my presence.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.680
Exactly.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.160
Now our last phrase, I bet.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.360
I bet.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.560
I bet.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.680
I bet.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.520
B-E-T bet.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.560
Bet.

08:26.560 --> 08:31.040
So when you say I bet, it means that you're pretty sure about something.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.800
You predict it will happen.

08:32.800 --> 08:36.400
Right, so let's listen to some more examples of I bet.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.280
Example one.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.040
I bet I'm going to get so much money for Chinese New Year.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.680
Example two.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.960
Robert Slade.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.560
Where do you take his?

08:56.560 --> 08:57.760
I have any stuck in traffic.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.160
Example three.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.920
I bet the boss is going to give us a big bonus this year.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.480
Well, I guess we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the third time.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.000
And then when we come back, Danny's going to tell us all about Chinese New Year.

09:22.560 --> 09:27.760
I'm so excited about Chinese New Year.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.520
When do I get to visit Grimma?

09:29.520 --> 09:31.520
Grimma makes the best dumplings in the world.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.440
Ha ha, right.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.600
Sounds to me like you're more excited about dumplings than seeing a Grimma.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.440
Of course I miss Grimma too.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.680
I bet she's going to teach me how to play magic on.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.800
Hey, Dad, are you going to buy me firecrackers this year?

09:44.800 --> 09:46.480
We're going to have the best fireworks.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.560
I'm really looking forward to lighting them.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.360
Son, firecrackers aren't toys.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.800
They are dangerous.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.200
Wow, fireworks are awesome.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.160
Wow.

09:56.160 --> 10:00.000
Don't you remember last year when I set out the firecrackers,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.880
you covered both your ears and hit behind your mother.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.160
And I was scared because I saw a bug.

10:06.160 --> 10:06.560
That's all.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.080
Ha ha, really?

10:08.720 --> 10:11.840
Oh, and I can't wait to watch the dragon dance.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.920
Dad, can I sit on your shoulders this time?

10:13.920 --> 10:16.080
Hey, I offered last year.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.360
Well, I, anyways, I was just thinking of the red end loops.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.640
I want to make a list of all the things I'm going to buy with my red end little money.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.600
I can't wait.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.200
I'm going to have so much money.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.600
Mom, can I get a pen and a piece of paper?

10:27.600 --> 10:30.000
I want a new transformer now to transform this.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.040
I promise, bye.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.960
You jack, I'll get a PSP game.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.240
Oh, oh, I need it.

10:47.040 --> 10:51.040
So, Danny, what are these red packets of money about?

10:51.040 --> 10:53.360
So, in Chinese, we call it Hong Bao.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.720
And it's basically a bag full of money.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.080
Why do you get money?

10:58.080 --> 10:58.880
As a gift.

10:58.880 --> 10:59.840
As a gift.

10:59.840 --> 11:00.720
Yeah.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.320
The children get it though.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.000
Only children get it.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.720
Wow.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.920
If you're at university student and you haven't got a job yet,

11:07.920 --> 11:12.640
then you can still ask for Hong Bao from your parent's relatives.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.400
So, is there some meaning to this gift of money?

11:16.400 --> 11:21.920
Well, it is believed that children have to put these red envelopes under their pillow

11:21.920 --> 11:25.360
on your ear's ear to scare away the evil spirits.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.640
Again, like the firecracker.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.440
I can't even spare.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.960
A lot of evil spirits in China.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.720
So, Danny, how much money would a kid get for Chinese New Year?

11:34.720 --> 11:39.520
Well, when I was little, the best year I got was 3,000 RMB.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.080
Which is like almost $500.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.080
Wow.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.080
Yeah.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.080
Yeah.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.080
I was so rich.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.080
Wow.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.080
Amazing.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.080
Uh-huh.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.080
What about this game, Majong?

11:51.080 --> 11:52.080
Majong?

11:52.080 --> 11:53.080
Majong.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.080
Have you played it?

11:54.080 --> 11:55.080
No.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.080
Um.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.080
Again, it's very traditional Chinese game.

11:59.080 --> 12:04.080
And you will see senior people's always gathering along the table.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.080
So, old people.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.080
Yeah.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.080
It's like a board game.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.080
Kind of like chess.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.080
It's kind of like chess, but they have a special, especially made chess.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.080
Uh-huh.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.080
It's very different.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.080
Okay.

12:14.080 --> 12:19.080
So, I want to know more about these, uh, the fireworks and firecrackers on Chinese New Year.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.080
Okay.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.080
Usually, we buy firecrackers.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.080
Yep.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.080
I believe fireworks are more expensive.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.080
So, we play firecrackers.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.080
Pow Zhang.

12:28.080 --> 12:32.080
And then, usually, we do it right after the midnight.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.080
So, 12 o'clock.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.080
Yep.

12:34.080 --> 12:40.080
It's very loud and, um, say, for example, I personally don't even dare to stay close.

12:40.080 --> 12:45.080
When they set off the firecrackers, because it's just way too loud.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.080
Yeah.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.080
And everyone starts to lie to them.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.080
So it's like-

12:49.080 --> 12:50.080
No, it's amazing.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.080
It's a pity.

12:51.080 --> 12:56.080
Um, I've seen Chinese New Year three times in China, and each time I've just been amazed.

12:56.080 --> 12:59.080
It's so, so cool and so noisy and so awesome.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.080
I mean, you've got to visit China to see this.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.080
Yeah.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
Yeah.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.080
It's a really cool festival.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.080
Yeah.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.080
And definitely playing with firecrackers is always fun.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.080
Yeah.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.080
Maybe a little bit dangerous.

13:09.080 --> 13:14.080
Well, everyone, uh, we've just learned about how New Year's is celebrated in China.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.080
And we want to know how to use celebrate New Year's in your country.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.080
Exactly.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.080
How do you welcome the New Year?

13:19.080 --> 13:22.080
How do you scare away evil spirits, right?

13:22.080 --> 13:23.080
Yep.
