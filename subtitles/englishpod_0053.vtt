00:11.200 --> 00:17.520
one of my favorite subjects. We're talking about food. Exactly. So on this occasion we're

00:17.520 --> 00:22.240
going to be talking about food. So let's preview some words on vocabulary preview.

00:22.400 --> 00:30.800
Very vocabulary preview. All right we have three words for you today and the first word is

00:30.800 --> 00:38.480
head chef. Head chef. Head chef. So what is a head chef? Well in a professional kitchen

00:39.280 --> 00:44.640
this is the boss of the kitchen or the leader of the kitchen. Okay so the head chef is the

00:44.640 --> 00:51.360
the main cook. Yes but he doesn't cook. But he doesn't cook. Okay all right so if he doesn't cook

00:51.440 --> 01:02.320
who's the one that does the cooking? That brings us to our second word. Sushchef. Sushchef. S-O-U-S. So the S is

01:02.320 --> 01:08.400
silent because it's like a French word. Yeah something like that. Okay so the Sushchef is the second

01:08.400 --> 01:12.720
in line to the head. Yeah he's the number two. Number two. So he's basically the one that's doing

01:12.720 --> 01:21.200
some of the work in the kitchen. Now let's take a look at our last word cuisine. cuisine. cuisine.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.640
So this is an interesting word. What exactly does it mean? Well it basically means cooking right?

01:26.640 --> 01:33.440
Okay like the art of cooking. So for example I can say French food. Yeah or French cuisine.

01:33.440 --> 01:39.120
French cuisine which includes all the food. Yeah and this is also the major that people study

01:39.120 --> 01:44.640
in college to become a chef. Yep. You study cuisine. And cuisine is a noun right? It's a noun. Okay

01:44.640 --> 01:50.960
so I think we're ready to dive into our dialogue. What exactly is going on? Well we're in a restaurant.

01:51.440 --> 01:56.320
And it's a really busy night. And so we're going to listen to what is happening in the kitchen.

02:05.040 --> 02:10.320
That's a way, sure. Your order will be ready shortly. Jean-Pierre, we have another special for table

02:10.320 --> 02:16.640
service. I'm working as fast as I can. We're willing the weeds. Where is my Sushchef? Look I need

02:16.640 --> 02:21.040
you to peel more potatoes. Marie. Chop some onions and carrots for the stew.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.480
I don't know what this is. Oh my God. I see some of that.

02:25.440 --> 02:30.160
Jean-Pierre, another special. We're really packed tonight. We're running low on wine.

02:30.160 --> 02:36.080
There's already left in the salon. Sorry I'm late everyone. Wow we're really doing well tonight.

02:36.080 --> 02:40.720
Hi, I'm Dr. King and get a very young. I need some so steered and the fish needs to be

02:40.720 --> 02:46.800
but chilled and bitter. Okay, how about it? Jean-Pierre, table saffron has requested to see the chef.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.040
I think there are food critics from cuisine magazine.

02:53.360 --> 02:59.600
Okay so a busy night here at this restaurant. I know it sounds like there's a lot of pressure on this

02:59.600 --> 03:06.400
chef. Yeah, you can tell in his voice that he's really stressed out. Yeah, okay let's take a look at

03:06.400 --> 03:13.280
some of this kitchen vocabulary that we found in language takeaway. Language takeaway.

03:14.800 --> 03:23.200
All right well we've got five words for use today. In the first one is peel peel peel peel

03:23.200 --> 03:32.320
peel. Peel. Peel. So this is a verb and it means to remove the outside skin. Okay so for

03:32.400 --> 03:38.080
example when you're going to eat a banana you must peel it first. You must peel it. You got to take away the yellow skin.

03:39.040 --> 03:46.960
What else do you peel oranges, potatoes, potatoes like in the dialogue? What else can you peel? I don't know carrots.

03:47.760 --> 03:53.040
Carrots. Some people peel their tomatoes. I don't know why. Yeah it is kind of weird. All right now let's

03:53.040 --> 04:01.120
take a look at our next word chop chop chop chop chop chop. So again another verb and it means to

04:01.280 --> 04:08.080
it means to cut food into pieces. So if you're going to eat carrots first you got to chop them. Exactly.

04:08.080 --> 04:15.440
Right you can put a whole carrot in your suit and your suit in your rice. Yeah. Okay chop. Okay our next

04:15.440 --> 04:23.120
word stirred. Yeah this is the past participle of the word stir. Okay so the verb stir stir.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.720
So when you stir something imagine you have a big pot and you've got a long spoon

04:31.280 --> 04:35.600
you move the spoon around in circles. Okay. So you're stirring the pot. You're mixing.

04:36.240 --> 04:42.240
To stir is very similar to mix. Yes. Okay. So you just move the food around. Move the food around.

04:42.240 --> 04:49.200
Yeah. Okay our next word butchered. Again the past participle of the verb butcher. Okay butchered.

04:49.200 --> 04:57.680
Butchered. Now this a verb to butcher something. It's when you remove all the bones and all the

04:57.840 --> 05:02.640
organs from the meat. Exactly. So you cut up the meat. And this is interesting because it's also

05:02.640 --> 05:09.600
a noun. Right a butcher is a person who cuts up meat. Okay so so it's really easy. A butcher butcher's meat.

05:10.880 --> 05:18.480
All right our last word butter. Butter. Butter. Butter. Butter. Okay so butter. This is weird.

05:19.040 --> 05:26.000
I know normally we all know the noun butter but here it's acting as a verb. Okay. So when you butter

05:26.080 --> 05:33.520
something you spread or put butter on it. Okay so to put butter on something so you can butter a piece of bread.

05:33.520 --> 05:41.040
Exactly. Or in this case the fish is being buttered. Mm-hmm sounds delicious. Okay now we're

05:41.040 --> 05:46.400
ready to listen to our dialogue for the second time. We're gonna slow it down a little bit so it's

05:46.400 --> 05:59.040
easier to understand. Right away sure your order will be ready shortly. Jump here. We have another

05:59.040 --> 06:07.600
special for table seven. I'm working as fast as I can. We are really in the weeds. Where is my

06:07.600 --> 06:16.800
sous chef? Look I need you to peel more potatoes. Marie. Chop some onions and carrots for this too.

06:20.400 --> 06:26.400
Jump here on all special. We're really packed tonight. We're running raw on wine. Is there

06:26.400 --> 06:34.800
only left in the salad? Whoa sorry I'm late everyone. Wow we are really doing well tonight.

06:34.800 --> 06:40.800
Marie, stop talking and come over here. I need the sauce to order and the fish needs to be

06:40.800 --> 06:48.560
butchered and buttered. Okay I'm on it. Jump here. Table seven has requested to see the chef.

06:48.560 --> 06:56.160
I think they are food critics from cuisine market trade. Okay so that seems to be a little bit

06:56.160 --> 07:00.960
better. Mm-hmm and hey I noticed that there's a lot of really great kitchen words and here are like

07:00.960 --> 07:05.920
words that you commonly hear in a professional kitchen. Okay so let's take a look at these kitchen

07:05.920 --> 07:13.520
words in fluency builder fluency builder. All right we've got three phrases and the first one is

07:13.520 --> 07:21.040
in the weeds in the weeds in the weeds in the weeds. So when you're in the weeds you're so so busy

07:21.040 --> 07:27.040
and you can't do all the work you need to do on time. Okay so in the weeds it means that you're

07:27.120 --> 07:32.400
really busy. Yes. And you can't finish everything. And you can't you have too much to do. Yeah.

07:32.400 --> 07:40.080
Okay in the weeds. Okay our next word running low on. Running low on. Running low on.

07:40.080 --> 07:46.880
Running low on. Okay so before we get into explaining what running low on means let's listen to some

07:46.880 --> 07:54.320
examples. Example one. You better look for a gas station we're running low on fuel.

07:57.040 --> 08:06.880
Example two. We're running low on beers can you go out and get some. Example three.

08:08.960 --> 08:12.480
My flashlight is running low on battery hurry up before it gets dark.

08:14.880 --> 08:22.880
So basically running low means you don't have much of this left. You don't have much of something left.

08:23.200 --> 08:29.200
So here they're running low on wine. So basically there's not much wine left. Right. So as we

08:29.200 --> 08:33.760
heard in the examples you could also be running low on fuel. For example in your car,

08:33.760 --> 08:40.480
etc. Running low on. All right and now let's take a look at our last word doing really well.

08:40.480 --> 08:47.280
Doing really well. We are doing really well. Doing really well. So this seems to be like a pretty

08:47.360 --> 08:53.760
simple structure. I mean we know all these words, right? So why is it special? Well basically

08:53.760 --> 08:59.360
if you say I am doing really well, maybe it sounds a little bit difficult to understand. What are you

08:59.360 --> 09:04.720
doing really well? So this is a great way of answering a question when somebody says how are you or

09:04.720 --> 09:10.160
how are you doing? You can say, oh I'm doing really well. Or I'm doing well. In your life,

09:10.160 --> 09:15.600
everything is good. And your life things are good and you're happy basically. But in this situation

09:15.600 --> 09:20.960
in the dialogue, what's doing really well? Well the restaurant is doing really well. The business

09:20.960 --> 09:26.640
is doing really well. So when he says we're doing really well, business is good. Good. They're making

09:26.640 --> 09:33.120
lots of money. Exactly. So you can use it with people. You can use it with businesses. You can say,

09:33.120 --> 09:39.520
oh I'm doing really well in my new job. Or my son is doing really well in school. Yep. Okay so

09:39.520 --> 09:45.120
you can use it in those different ways. All right well let's listen to the dialogue one last time

09:45.120 --> 09:48.960
and we'll be able to hear all of these great words and phrases we just talked about.

09:55.120 --> 09:59.920
Gosh oh wait sure, your order will be ready shortly. Jean Pierre, we have another special

09:59.920 --> 10:05.840

10:11.280 --> 10:13.200
What is it about? What is it about? What is it about?

10:15.600 --> 10:20.320

10:20.320 --> 10:26.240

10:26.240 --> 10:30.880

but chilled and buttered. Okay, how about it? Jean Pierre, table saver has requested to see the chef.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.280
I think there are food critics from Quercine Magazine.

10:43.680 --> 10:49.360
So Marco, do you think this chef had a rat under his hat? That was a really good movie.

10:49.360 --> 10:55.520
Yeah, I had a two-y that Disney Pixar where a rat is a cook. Yes, it's interesting. I love to cook

10:55.520 --> 11:02.080
but I'm not very good at cooking. Really? But it's good because for me it helps me relieve stress.

11:02.080 --> 11:06.080
Me too actually. You know if I'm in a bad mood I go home and cook something to eat

11:06.480 --> 11:12.240
the world seems a happier place. And people don't understand it because they think cooking is work.
