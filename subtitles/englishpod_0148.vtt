00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
Hello everyone and welcome back to another lesson here at English Pod, my name is Marko.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.440
And my name is Katherine, so Marko, what are we talking about today?

00:11.440 --> 00:18.320
Today we are taking a look at a guy who is a little bit too afraid of people in general.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.320
There's a good word for this in English, someone who's almost too afraid all the time,

00:22.320 --> 00:26.400
someone who is overly cautious. We call this person paranoid.

00:26.480 --> 00:34.080
Okay, so if you are paranoid, you think that everyone wants to hurt you or that everyone is out to get.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.680
Wait, did you hear that?

00:35.680 --> 00:36.880
Did you hear that?

00:36.880 --> 00:37.680
Did you hear that?

00:37.680 --> 00:38.880
Did you hear that?

00:38.880 --> 00:41.120
Marko, can you check that?

00:41.120 --> 00:45.520
Okay, that's paranoid. You know, you're always hearing voices and noises and things.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.320
So, a paranoid, somebody that is paranoid.

00:48.320 --> 00:52.880
All right, so why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time and see what this person

00:52.880 --> 00:54.160
is all paranoid about?

00:54.240 --> 00:54.800
There he's again.

01:02.480 --> 01:08.320
Dan, Dan, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.720
Is everything okay?

01:10.720 --> 01:11.760
Just get over here.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.840
Come in, quickly.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.840
So, since when is your house a bank?

01:26.400 --> 01:27.360
What do you mean?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.840
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

01:31.840 --> 01:34.000
Security, Dan, security.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.840
You can never be too safe, you know.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.000
A lot of sickos out there.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.200
Just the other day, they cut that heaping term, red-handed,

01:43.200 --> 01:46.400
kind of high-power counsel, and binoculars by his window.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.400
What's the matter with you?

01:48.960 --> 01:50.560
Why are you acting all paranoid?

01:51.200 --> 01:51.840
Parenthood.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.680
I'm not paranoid!

01:53.680 --> 01:54.640
I'm cautious!

01:55.120 --> 01:58.240
You see, Dan, we have to be unguarded all the time.

01:58.960 --> 02:01.840
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

02:02.640 --> 02:09.280
Tell the marketers, solicitors, even your bank, they have way too much information.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.800
I like to keep everything on a need to know basis.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.640
Okay, well, what did you want to see me about?

02:16.640 --> 02:18.320
You're being watched.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.120
Be careful, Dan.

02:20.000 --> 02:20.640
Be careful.

02:29.040 --> 02:34.400
All right, we're back, so yeah, I think this guy is a little bit too cautious.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.640
I would have to agree with you, and I would go so far as to call him paranoid, but uh,

02:38.640 --> 02:42.560
there's a lot of great stuff in this dialogue that we can use in a lot of different situations,

02:42.560 --> 02:46.400
so let's take a look at some of these new words in today's language takeaway.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.120
Language takeaway.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.280
All right, the first word on language takeaway today is Siko.

02:53.840 --> 02:59.360
Siko is also the name of a movie that was a documentary famous in America by Michael Moore actually,

02:59.360 --> 03:05.360
but Siko in this context means someone who is a bit weird in a bad way.

03:05.360 --> 03:09.600
So if you tell somebody you're sick, but like in that tone, you're saying you're sick,

03:09.600 --> 03:10.720
you're a sick person.

03:10.720 --> 03:11.680
You're gross.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.120
Right, you're saying you're gross.

03:13.200 --> 03:19.360
Or in a pro people who have inappropriate humor, who make jokes about not so nice things, right?

03:19.360 --> 03:24.960
Yeah, they're sick, but in this case, Siko's are people who maybe like to hurt other people,

03:24.960 --> 03:29.520
or people who are a little bit crazy, people who are not normal.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.320
So it's not a nice way of calling someone crazy, right?

03:32.320 --> 03:34.800
If you say, oh, he's a Siko, it's not really nice.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.600
Not at all.

03:35.600 --> 03:40.400
It's a way of saying that you're almost scared of this person because they're kind of weird and almost,

03:40.400 --> 03:41.440
they have problems.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.960
All right, so Siko.

03:43.600 --> 03:48.480
Moving on to our next word, we saw that the guy was afraid of telemarketers.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.200
Exactly.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.320
So what are these guys?

03:50.320 --> 03:52.400
Well, we've got two words being put together here.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.600
Tella and market.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.720
So tella, like telephone.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.520
Tella phone.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.760
Community overcommunications, so they're not in person.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.000
They're people who call you up and market things.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.320
They try to sell you stuff over the phone.

04:04.320 --> 04:09.120
So this is very common, you get a phone calling your cell phone and they ask you if you're

04:09.120 --> 04:14.720
happy with your long distance calling plan or if you need new TV cable or something like that.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.360
And they always call during dinner or late at night.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.880
Which drives me nuts.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.680
Exactly.

04:19.680 --> 04:20.880
So these are telemarketers.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.760
These are people who call you trying to sell things to you.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.520
And very similar to these is a solicitors.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.200
Exactly, but the big difference here with solicitors and telemarketers

04:31.200 --> 04:33.760
is that solicitors actually go to your house.

04:33.760 --> 04:34.960
They knock on your door.

04:34.960 --> 04:35.360
Hmm.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.880
So they're also called a door to door salesmen or saleswoman.

04:38.880 --> 04:39.360
That's right.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.880
So a door to door salesmen, they go from door to door trying to sell things.

04:42.880 --> 04:47.600
But in this case, a solicitor is someone who comes to your house to try to get you to do something,

04:47.600 --> 04:48.800
to buy something.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.840
All right, very good.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.840
And moving on to our next word, we have a peeping Tom.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.240
That's right, we heard this a little bit earlier in the dialogue.

04:56.240 --> 05:01.120
And a peeping Tom is again a negative thing to say about someone.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.680
A peeping Tom, well, the word peep means to look.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.160
But kind of like, yeah, it's a quick look.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.640
So peeping Tom is a person who spies on other people.

05:10.640 --> 05:15.040
Okay, so a synonym of a peeping Tom would be a warrior.

05:15.040 --> 05:15.520
A warrior.

05:15.520 --> 05:21.920
So someone who without getting caught tries to look at other people while they're in their homes.

05:21.920 --> 05:26.000
And so it's really bad because it's usually inappropriate.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.440
It's usually people who are watching women get undressed or.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.080
Right, right.

05:30.080 --> 05:30.640
And yeah.

05:30.640 --> 05:36.000
So a peeping Tom is just an informal way of saying a warrior or somebody who is spying on people.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.000
So those are the words for today in language.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.640
Take away, let's listen to our dialogue again.

05:40.640 --> 05:46.480
And then we'll be right back.

05:47.760 --> 05:54.080
Then, then, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.000
Is everything okay?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.040
Just get over here.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.800
Come in, quickly.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.120
So since when is your house a bank?

06:05.280 --> 06:06.240
What do you mean?

06:06.960 --> 06:10.880
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

06:10.880 --> 06:12.000
Security, Dan.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.120
Security.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.800
You can never be too safe, you know.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.960
A lot of sickos out there.

06:17.680 --> 06:22.240
Just the other day, they caught that peeping Tom red handed.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.280
Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.440
What's the matter with you?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.440
Why are you acting all paranoid?

06:30.080 --> 06:30.800
Paranoid.

06:31.360 --> 06:32.640
I'm not paranoid.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.520
I'm cautious.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.200
You see, Dan?

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
We have to be on guard at all time.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.880
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.560
Tell marketers, solicitors, even your bank.

06:45.120 --> 06:48.160
They have way too much information.

06:48.160 --> 06:51.680
I like to keep everything on a need to know basis.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.520
Okay.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.680
Well, what did you want to see me about?

06:55.680 --> 06:57.280
You're being watched.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.080
Be careful, Dan.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.520
Be careful.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.480
Now we're back and we had some interesting phrases in the dialogue.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.760
The first one being, you can never be too safe.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.160
Fluency build up.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.520
All right, so this is a common mom phrase.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.280
You often hear mothers say this when they're sending their kids off to school or whatever.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.680
They don't talk to strangers and the kid says,

07:21.680 --> 07:22.480
well, why not?

07:22.480 --> 07:24.480
You can never be too safe, right?

07:24.480 --> 07:27.040
It's good to air on the side of caution.

07:27.120 --> 07:32.320
So it's okay to be extra safe or extra cautious.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.360
Just in case.

07:33.360 --> 07:33.760
Exactly.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.200
You never know what's going to happen.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.320
So it's better to be cautious than not.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.480
And that's what this person saying.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.720
He's saying, well, security, it's important.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.160
You can never be too safe.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.080
You never know what might happen.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.080
Is there another way that we can combine it?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.320
Like you can never be too careful?

07:50.320 --> 07:51.040
Exactly.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.000
Basically the same thing.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.800
Same thing.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.120
Yeah.

07:53.120 --> 07:53.760
All right.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.800
What's our next phrase?

07:54.880 --> 07:58.080
Our next phrase is about this peeping Tom,

07:58.080 --> 07:59.840
this person that they caught.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.920
They caught him red handed.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.600
We caught you red handed.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.680
Or he's been caught red handed.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.800
So what does that mean?

08:07.360 --> 08:10.000
Uh, it's a big colorful phrase.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.040
And I don't just mean that because we're calling him red handed.

08:13.040 --> 08:18.400
But to catch red handed means to catch someone while they're doing something wrong.

08:18.400 --> 08:18.640
Mm-hmm.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.200
So if I see you breaking into someone's house

08:23.200 --> 08:24.640
and I say, Marco, stop.

08:24.640 --> 08:25.440
I'm catching you.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.400
Stop now.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.920
I just caught you red handed.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.360
You saw me doing the act.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.400
Exactly.

08:30.400 --> 08:34.560
Uh, in another way of saying this is you caught him with his hand in the cookie jar.

08:34.560 --> 08:35.040
Mm-hmm.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.520
Okay, and this is another great phrase.

08:37.520 --> 08:43.360
You can imagine a child who sees the cookies in a very special jar on the counter in a kitchen.

08:43.360 --> 08:43.680
Mm-hmm.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.440
And Mom says, don't eat the cookies.

08:45.440 --> 08:50.080
Well, the child goes into the kitchen and sees the cookies and opens the jar and puts his hand in the jar.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.120
And then Mom comes and says,

08:51.920 --> 08:54.960
That's the boy with his hand or a child with their hand in the cookie jar.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.000
So it's the same thing.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.120
I can say, I caught you with your hand in the cookie jar.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.120
Or you are caught red handed.

09:01.120 --> 09:01.600
All right.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.240
And our last phrase for today is,

09:04.240 --> 09:06.640
you are on a need to know basis.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.600
All right, this is a great one.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.920
This is often said in spy movies.

09:09.920 --> 09:10.720
Yeah.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.280
Um, so we say, you're on a need to know basis.

09:13.280 --> 09:17.120
That means that if you really need to know something, then I will tell you.

09:17.120 --> 09:17.440
Right.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.040
But if not, I won't.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.320
So you only have the information that is necessary.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.080
No more or less, right?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.680
You're on a need to know basis.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.880
All right. So I say, tell me, Mark,

09:26.880 --> 09:28.800
go tell me what happened. I want to know.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.160
Right. And I can say, no, no.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.680
You're on a need to know basis.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.280
And you don't need to know this.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.880
Oh, all right.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.640
So a need to know basis.

09:36.640 --> 09:40.880
As you say, very popular among spy movies and government movies and stuff.

09:40.880 --> 09:41.840
And steer, similarly.

09:41.840 --> 09:42.560
Yeah.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.360
All right.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.880
So let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time and we'll be right back.

09:49.040 --> 10:01.840
So then, then, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.520
Is everything okay?

10:03.520 --> 10:04.560
Just get over here.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.840
Come in, quickly.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.280
So since when is your house a bank?

10:19.280 --> 10:20.880
What are you mean?

10:20.880 --> 10:24.720
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

10:24.720 --> 10:25.840
Security, Dan.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.040
Security.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.360
You can never be too safe, you know.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.520
A lot of sickos out there.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.800
Just the other day, they caught that heaping term.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.080
Red handed.

10:36.080 --> 10:40.160
Kind of high power counsel for the maculons by his window.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.840
What's the matter with you?

10:41.840 --> 10:44.080
Why are you acting all paranoid?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.480
I'm not paranoid!

10:46.480 --> 10:47.920
I'm cautious!

10:47.920 --> 10:49.040
You see, Dan?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.960
We have to be unguarded all the time.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.560
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.800
Tell the marketers, solicitors, even your bank.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.000
They have way too much information.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.520
I like to keep everything on a need to know basis.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.360
Okay.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.520
Well, what did you want to see me about?

11:09.520 --> 11:11.040
You're being watched.

11:11.040 --> 11:11.840
Be careful, Dan.

11:12.720 --> 11:13.440
Be careful.

11:14.080 --> 11:26.080
All right, so the guys a little bit paranoid.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.680
There's another word for this, as well.

11:27.680 --> 11:28.320
Similar, right?

11:28.320 --> 11:29.360
Let's get so.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.360
Skits of Frenia is a disease.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.000
And a lot of people have it, and it's not too uncommon.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.600
But a popular slang word to say someone's crazy is skits so.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.560
So, if you guys remember this movie, a beautiful mind.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.600
It's all about this famous mathematician named

11:43.680 --> 11:44.880
John Nash.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.600
And while he was a genius, he came up with Game Theory,

11:47.600 --> 11:52.080
and a lot of subsequent usage of this for a economy for many things.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.280
But it was proven that he was a skits of Frenic, right?

11:55.280 --> 11:56.400
A paranoid skits of Frenic.

11:56.400 --> 12:01.920
So, not only did he kind of have experience reality in different ways,

12:01.920 --> 12:03.200
but he's also paranoid.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.480
So, he was afraid that the government was trying to kill him.

12:06.480 --> 12:12.400
And so, he was irrationally afraid of everything going on around him.

12:12.400 --> 12:17.040
And it made him very unsafe because he could hurt himself or her other people.

12:17.040 --> 12:22.000
And the interesting thing about this is that there is no actual cure for it.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.800
You just learn to cope and live with it.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.880
So, you never really get cured.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.240
You just kind of live with it.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.400
Learn how to understand what's real and what's not.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.760
So, it's interesting.

12:31.760 --> 12:34.080
It's a great movie also, by the way, if you ever,

12:34.080 --> 12:36.400
if you've never seen it or you get a chance to watch it.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.400
And that's all the time we have for today.
