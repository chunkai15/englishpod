00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great lesson here at English Pod, my name

00:07.400 --> 00:08.400
is Marko.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.280
And my name is Katherine, so Marko today we've got a little bit of an unusual lesson because

00:12.280 --> 00:15.640
we're talking about hypothetical situations.

00:15.640 --> 00:20.840
Right, we're talking about a unreal situation or something that may happen or may not

00:20.840 --> 00:21.840
happen.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.680
Okay, so you're going to hear all about this in today's dialogue.

00:24.680 --> 00:27.360
We're going to hear a couple of times and we're going to come back, we'll be breaking

00:27.360 --> 00:32.400
it down for you so you know all about these great phrases and how to talk about not

00:32.400 --> 00:34.360
real situations with your friends.

00:34.360 --> 00:46.640
Okay, next question, if Eric asks you out on a date, what would you say?

00:46.640 --> 00:52.880
duh, I would say yes, Eric is the most popular kid in school, okay my turn.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.800
What would you do if you won the lottery?

00:55.800 --> 01:02.520
Let's see, if I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world.

01:02.520 --> 01:06.240
If you buy me a ticket, I'll go with you for sure.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.680
My dad would freak out if I even mentioned a trip like that.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.760
Alright, this is a good one.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.560
What would your mom say if you told her that you're going to get married?

01:15.560 --> 01:19.680
If I told her that, she would faint and have me commissive.

01:19.680 --> 01:29.560
Alright, so I think that was clear and we're very common situation to teenage girls

01:29.560 --> 01:34.600
talking to each other about boys and what would you do and that I'd like to do.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.720
Guys do this too, so don't just put this on the girl, okay.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.560
I don't think we do it like this though.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.720
No, but it's actually a very popular game in the car to play the What If game.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.440
Another What If game, exactly.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.480
And that's exactly the topic that we want to talk about today is the structure what

01:49.480 --> 01:51.520
if, which is actually called a conditional.

01:51.520 --> 01:57.160
Alright, it's a condition of because the results, the thing that happens depends on something

01:57.160 --> 01:58.160
else.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.160
Exactly.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.760
So let's actually take a look at the words in today's language takeaway before we talk about

02:02.760 --> 02:06.000
all this grammar stuff.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.480
Language takeaway.

02:07.480 --> 02:12.760
Okay, so we'll start out with some basic words, well, you know, they were talking about

02:12.800 --> 02:20.880
guys and she said, if Eric asks you out, right, so to ask somebody out, okay, so this

02:20.880 --> 02:24.920
might be a little bit strange because you think, okay, to ask is to ask a question, but to

02:24.920 --> 02:30.320
ask out, it's a fixed phrase and something you say, these two words go together, right?

02:30.320 --> 02:37.440
So I want to ask someone out, I mean, I want to invite someone on a date on a romantic date.

02:37.760 --> 02:42.480
So yeah, I want to ask him out to dinner or he asked me out to the movies.

02:42.480 --> 02:47.400
Now, if I didn't want to ask somebody out on a romantic date, what would, what, what

02:47.400 --> 02:48.400
would you use?

02:48.400 --> 02:53.880
I'd say you could invite someone out, but then again, it's always a little bit, well,

02:53.880 --> 02:57.720
you can say invite for someone if you're going to ask them on a date too.

02:57.720 --> 03:03.360
So yeah, I'd say to ask out is always romantic and to invite can be romantic or just

03:03.360 --> 03:04.360
friends.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.680
Okay, so to ask somebody out.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.200
They were talking about other situations and maybe they would go on a trip or something.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.320
And she said, my dad would freak out.

03:15.680 --> 03:19.400
This is a great phrase, this is something that I used a lot when I was a teenager.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.000
The word freak out freak out.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.280
So the verb to freak out means to be really angry or upset or, you know, it could be a good

03:28.280 --> 03:32.040
thing or a bad thing, but usually when we're talking about our parents, it's a bad thing.

03:32.040 --> 03:32.720
It's a bad thing.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.920
So they get angry, they start yelling at you.

03:34.920 --> 03:35.920
Yeah, so freak out.

03:35.920 --> 03:42.920
And the last word that we have on language take away today is a committed.

03:42.920 --> 03:47.920
Well, let's look at the whole phrase, he says, she would have me committed.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.920
So this is actually being done to someone.

03:50.920 --> 03:55.920
Now, we did look at this word before, but basically for marriage, right?

03:55.920 --> 03:57.920
To commit to somebody to promise.

03:57.920 --> 04:04.920
Yeah, but to have someone committed means that you're going to send them away to maybe

04:05.920 --> 04:06.920
a mental institution.

04:06.920 --> 04:07.920
Exactly.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.920
So this means they have psychological problems.

04:09.920 --> 04:14.920
And someone else sends them to the hospital because they can't send themselves.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.920
Exactly.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.920
So it's always used to have someone committed, right?

04:19.920 --> 04:20.920
Right?

04:20.920 --> 04:21.920
Because it's being done to them.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.920
They don't want it to happen.

04:23.920 --> 04:24.920
It's involuntary.

04:24.920 --> 04:25.920
Okay.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.920
So she had him committed.

04:27.920 --> 04:32.920
My mom's going to have me committed if I keep working 20 hours a day.

04:32.920 --> 04:33.920
Exactly.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.920
That's the way you use it.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.920
And so now you have another way of using this verb.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.920
But now I think we should listen to this dialogue again.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.920
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

04:41.920 --> 04:50.920
And then we'll come back and look at this grammar focus that we want to talk about.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.920
Okay.

04:51.920 --> 04:52.920
Next question.

04:52.920 --> 04:56.920
If Eric asks you out on a date, what would you say?

04:56.920 --> 04:59.920
Da, I would say yes.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.920
Eric is the most popular kid in school.

05:02.920 --> 05:03.920
Okay.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.920
My turn.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.920
What would you do if you won the lottery?

05:08.920 --> 05:10.920
Let's see.

05:10.920 --> 05:16.920
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.920
If you buy me a ticket, I will go with you for sure.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.920
My dad would freak out if I even mention a trip like that.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.920
All right.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.920
This is a good one.

05:28.920 --> 05:33.920
What would your mom say if you told her you were going to get married?

05:33.920 --> 05:41.920
If I told her that she would faint and have me committed.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.920
All right.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.920
So we understood all the vocab now.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.920
Now let's take a look at these unreal situations and what we were saying.

05:48.920 --> 05:49.920
What if game?

05:49.920 --> 05:50.920
Right.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.920
So I think it's important to push these into two different categories.

05:54.920 --> 05:55.920
Right.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.920
We have one kind where it's very unrealistic.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.920
It's probably not going to happen.

06:00.920 --> 06:01.920
That kind of situation.

06:01.920 --> 06:05.920
And the other one is a situation that could very well happen.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.920
Something that's probably very common.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.920
Okay.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.920
So the first one we're going to talk about is very unrealistic situations.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
Things that probably won't happen.

06:13.920 --> 06:14.920
Okay.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.920
So let's take a look at an example that we found in the dialogue.

06:17.920 --> 06:23.920
The most common one and I think everybody gets asked this question is if you won the lottery,

06:23.920 --> 06:24.920
what would you do?

06:24.920 --> 06:25.920
Okay.

06:25.920 --> 06:29.920
If you won the lottery, so this is a situation that's very uncommon.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.920
Right.

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
Not many people win the lottery.

06:31.920 --> 06:37.920
So we have to say if you won the lottery, to use this verb in the past tense,

06:37.920 --> 06:41.920
if you won the lottery, if this happened, what would you do?

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
Right.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.920
So Katherine, if you won the lottery, what would you do?

06:44.920 --> 06:49.920
If I won the lottery, I would buy a boat and sail around the world.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.920
With my friends.

06:51.920 --> 06:52.920
All right.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.920
So another example, again, using the same structure, right?

06:55.920 --> 07:02.920
The verb in the simple past tense, we would say if you were stuck on an island with one other person,

07:02.920 --> 07:03.920
who would that be?

07:03.920 --> 07:04.920
All right.

07:04.920 --> 07:10.920
So if you were stuck on a desert island with one person, who would that person be?

07:10.920 --> 07:13.920
So Marko, I'm going to ask you, who would it be?

07:13.920 --> 07:17.920
I think it would be an engineer or a scientist that could probably get me off the ice.

07:17.920 --> 07:18.920
What about your girlfriend?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.920
Well, you know, that's the point.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.920
I can get to her quicker.

07:22.920 --> 07:23.920
Okay.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.920
I would say maybe kind of romantic.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.920
So that's the first situation.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.920
We've got these situations like being stuck on an island, winning the lottery.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.920
These are very unlikely.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.920
But what about the other kind?

07:36.920 --> 07:40.920
But before we move on to that, you notice that we used the verb,

07:40.920 --> 07:45.920
was we didn't say if I was on an island, I said if I were, right?

07:45.920 --> 07:47.920
Or if you were.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.920
So this is the way that you use it in these conditionals.

07:50.920 --> 07:55.920
If I were you or if you were president of the United States.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
Yeah, this is a rule.

07:56.920 --> 07:57.920
So this is a grammar rule.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.920
We're not going to describe why it happens because it's very, very complicated.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.920
And you can look it up on our site, but we're going to describe how to use it.

08:04.920 --> 08:05.920
That's the most important.

08:05.920 --> 08:11.920
So we can say, for example, Marko, if I were you, I would die my hair red.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
Why?

08:12.920 --> 08:13.920
I don't know.

08:13.920 --> 08:14.920
I think it would look cool.

08:14.920 --> 08:15.920
I don't think so.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.920
So if I were you, I would.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.920
Or if you were me, what would you do?

08:21.920 --> 08:22.920
Exactly.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.920
So we always use it like this, right?

08:24.920 --> 08:29.920
If you're going to use this conditional, always use war for the subject never was.

08:29.920 --> 08:30.920
Right.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.920
So you can tell this is very, very big grammar issue.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.920
A lot of English speakers make this mistake.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.920
Yeah.

08:36.920 --> 08:37.920
Very many.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.920
So, but now you know that you shouldn't make this mistake.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.920
And you can speak properly.

08:41.920 --> 08:50.920
So now that we've seen these semi unreal situations, let's move on to something that's a little bit more probable that it may happen.

08:50.920 --> 08:55.920
Right. So we've got these situations that are common or likely.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.920
For example, in this lesson we hear, I will go with you for sure.

08:59.920 --> 09:04.920
So this is, if you buy me a ticket to travel, of course I will go with you.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.920
So if you buy, this is in the present tense.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.920
If you buy, then I will.

09:09.920 --> 09:10.920
Right.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.920
So now you notice a difference.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.920
The verb is in the present and then we use instead of wood, we use a will.

09:16.920 --> 09:24.920
So again, I can say, if it rains tomorrow, I will stay home and watch TV all day.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.920
Okay. So think about this.

09:26.920 --> 09:31.920
Before we talked about going to desert islands, now we're talking about rain and the weather.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.920
They're very, very different.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.920
The rain is, you know, it's very common.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.920
So we can say, if it rains tomorrow, I will need an umbrella.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.920
What about this? If we have lunch tomorrow, what will we eat?

09:42.920 --> 09:45.920
Okay. So we have lunch pretty much every day.

09:45.920 --> 09:46.920
Yeah, pretty much.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.920
So again, it's a, it's a situation that is very probable.

09:49.920 --> 09:55.920
So if we have lunch tomorrow, we will probably eat, I don't know, pasta.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.920
I think, and then like pasta, pasta noodles.

09:58.920 --> 09:59.920
Yeah.

09:59.920 --> 10:04.920
All right. So Marco, let's take another listen to some of these phrases and try and figure out why you're listening,

10:04.920 --> 10:08.920
which kind of conditional it is first or the second.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.920
Example one.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.920
If it's sunny today, we will go to the park.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.920
Example two.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.920
I would get a divorce if I were you.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.920
Example three.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.920
Mary will be very sad if Joe leaves.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.920
Example four.

10:30.920 --> 10:35.920
We wouldn't be so late if Nick drove faster.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.920
Very good. So we heard different examples.

10:38.920 --> 10:43.920
And the first conditional is the one that we mentioned is very probable.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.920
And the second conditional is the one that's not so probable.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.920
So they're very easy to distinguish.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.920
You don't really need to know the names, just know how to use them, right?

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
Exactly.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.920
And so just remember, if you were me, what would you do?

10:56.920 --> 11:00.920
We've got these kind of pairs, these words that go together.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.920
And the other one is more common.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.920
Maybe if it rains tomorrow, I will bring an umbrella.

11:06.920 --> 11:07.920
Perfect.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.920
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time,

11:10.920 --> 11:12.920
just to kind of reinforce everything,

11:12.920 --> 11:14.920
and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.920
Okay, next question.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.920
If Eric asks you out on a date, what would you say?

11:25.920 --> 11:27.920
duh, I would say yes.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.920
Eric is the most popular kid in school.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.920
Okay, my turn.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.920
What would you do if you won the lottery?

11:34.920 --> 11:35.920
Let's see.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.920
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.920
If you buy me a ticket, I'll go with you for sure.

11:44.920 --> 11:48.920
My dad would freak out if I even mentioned a trip like that.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.920
All right, this is a good one.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.920
What would your mom say if you told her that you're going to get married?

11:53.920 --> 11:57.920
If I told her that, she would faint and have me commissive.

12:01.920 --> 12:06.920
So Marco, if we talk any more about grammar,

12:06.920 --> 12:09.920
someone's going to have to have me commit it.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.920
It is a little bit difficult to talk about grammar,

12:11.920 --> 12:14.920
especially on a podcast, because it's such a difficult topic,

12:14.920 --> 12:16.920
and it's also kind of heavy, right?

12:16.920 --> 12:18.920
It is, but I'll tell you this.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.920
These are very, very common phrases.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.920
People use these all the time.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.920
We talk in hypotheticals very often.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.920
So if you're asking for advice, for example,

12:28.920 --> 12:30.920
or if you're just playing a game in the car,

12:30.920 --> 12:34.920
you're going to encounter these, and it's very important to be able to know how to use that.

12:34.920 --> 12:35.920
Mm-hmm.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.920
So in this is what we want to see now, please come to our website at EnglishPod.com,

And if you have questions about the stuff that we've been talking about,
