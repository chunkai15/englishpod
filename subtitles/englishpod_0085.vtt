00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Hello English learners. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.440
And I'm Erica. And today we're bringing you another lesson on our sport series.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.400
We're talking about baseball today.

00:12.400 --> 00:18.800
Baseball the American National Pass Time. Is it? Yes it is. Okay. So we're going to be looking at

00:18.800 --> 00:24.160
this interesting sport that is played mainly in the Caribbean and well it's actually very popular

00:24.160 --> 00:29.440
in the United States and Japan. That's right. Korea. Yeah. So we're not only going to learn

00:29.440 --> 00:36.320
a bunch of baseball language, but we're also going to see how baseball has a big influence on

00:36.320 --> 00:40.800
English in general. That's right. So we're going to learn a lot of great things today. So why don't

00:40.800 --> 00:42.960
we start and listen to our dialogue.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.360
Hello baseball fans and welcome back to today's game. My name is Rick Fields.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.040
And of course I am here once again with a man that seals the deal Bob Copeland.

01:03.040 --> 01:07.200
It's a beautiful day to see two world-class teams face each other and fight for their

01:07.200 --> 01:11.840
right to be called champions. Well the National Anthem has just been sung and the

01:11.840 --> 01:17.840
Empire has started the game. It's time to play ball. Roger Vargas is up at bat.

01:17.840 --> 01:23.200
Picture winds up and strike one very nice curve ball by the pitcher. The catcher gives him the

01:23.200 --> 01:31.680
sign. He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive. The players are scrambling to get the ball. Vargas

01:31.680 --> 01:37.680
gets to first base and he's still doing it. The outfielder throws it to second. Vargas slides.

01:37.680 --> 01:44.080
He's safe. Great play. We have a runner on third and a bit bat is Brian O'Cummy.

01:44.080 --> 01:49.680
There's the pitch. He hits it. It's going. Going. That ball is gone.

01:49.760 --> 01:55.360
Home run by O'Cummy. That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the

01:55.360 --> 02:00.720
fifth inning here at Richie Stadium.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.640
All right. Well a pretty exciting game there at Richie Stadium. Exactly. And we have some

02:08.640 --> 02:16.000
interesting players. Roger Vargas and Brian O'Cummy. All right. So well we saw some great words.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.760
And well it's time for us to take a look at them now in language takeaway.

02:21.760 --> 02:29.760
Language takeaway. Okay we're going to look at some common sports and baseball words here.

02:29.760 --> 02:35.360
Now the first phrase will hear this almost at any sort of international sports event, right?

02:35.360 --> 02:43.280
Exactly. And it's the national anthem. National anthem. National anthem. So this is a song, right?

02:43.280 --> 02:48.320
Exactly. It's the song that you sing about your country. And many people confuse it, right?

02:48.320 --> 02:54.560
Yeah. A lot of people might say national him. Okay him. Because in some languages it might be like a

02:54.560 --> 03:00.960
him, like literally translating. Yeah. But in English it's called the national anthem. The national anthem.

03:01.520 --> 03:06.800
All right. So what about our next word? Well we were talking about the picture

03:07.760 --> 03:15.840
picture. PITCHER. The picture. Okay and now this is one of the players on the baseball team

03:15.840 --> 03:21.680
and his job is to throw the ball to throw the ball really fast so that the guy can hit it with the bat.

03:21.680 --> 03:29.440
Okay. So that's the picture. Now the interesting thing is that the baseball commentator said

03:29.520 --> 03:37.520
the picture winds up winds up to wind up to wind up. Okay. Well let me paint you a picture.

03:37.520 --> 03:45.360
Okay. So imagine a clock and you're turning, turning and turning the clock to wind up to get it

03:45.360 --> 03:50.400
ready to go to make it work. Exactly. So imagine the picture doing the same sort of thing,

03:50.400 --> 03:56.400
bringing his arm back behind him, getting ready to throw the ball. Okay. So that is to wind up.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.760
Very good. So you can use this word not only in baseball but for other things that require

04:01.760 --> 04:07.680
you to do the section. Right to turn something and get it, get it ready to have lots of power. Like some

04:07.680 --> 04:18.320
toy or maybe like a music box? Okay. Wind up. What about our next phrase? Well Roger Vargas hit a line drive.

04:18.320 --> 04:25.600
Line drive. Line drive. Okay. So what is a line drive? What's a term from baseball? And when you hit a line

04:25.600 --> 04:32.960
drive, you hit the ball sort of low on towards the ground and it travels along the outside of the

04:32.960 --> 04:38.080
field. Right. So the ball basically travels along the foul line. That white line. The white line.

04:38.080 --> 04:45.760
Yeah. Exactly. Very good. So that's a line drive. And so the players on the field were scrambling to

04:45.760 --> 04:52.640
get the ball scrambling. Now we know scrambled eggs from one of our lessons. Yes. But the

04:52.640 --> 05:00.480
verb to scramble means to move quickly in a disorganized way to do something. Okay. So the players

05:00.480 --> 05:05.840
are moving very fast trying to get the ball but they're not doing it very well. Right. And you can

05:05.840 --> 05:11.360
use this in other ways, right? Not just in baseball. Right. For example, we can say the people are

05:11.360 --> 05:16.880
scrambling to buy their tickets for the concert. Yeah. Or I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I'm

05:16.880 --> 05:21.680
scrambling to get everything ready. Exactly. It's a very good term that you can use also in your

05:22.400 --> 05:27.280
life. Exactly. All right. And what about our last word for today on language takeaway? Well,

05:27.280 --> 05:35.120
they were in the fifth inning of the game. Okay. So inning inning inning. All right. This is another

05:35.120 --> 05:43.360
baseball term. And it just means the period of play. Okay. So we learn for example that in soccer,

05:43.360 --> 05:50.880
you have two halves. Or in hockey, you have three periods. All right. And in baseball, you have nine

05:50.880 --> 05:57.440
innings. Okay. Great. So some interesting sports and baseball vocabulary. Now, I think it will

05:57.440 --> 06:01.440
help us to hear this again slower. So let's listen to the dialogue.

06:08.480 --> 06:16.160
Hello, baseball fans. And welcome back to today's game. My name is Rick Fields. And of course,

06:16.240 --> 06:23.120
I am here once again with the man that seals the deal Bob Copeland. It's a beautiful day to see

06:23.120 --> 06:29.200
two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions. Well,

06:29.200 --> 06:36.960
the national anthem has just been sung. And the Empire has started the game. It's time to play ball.

06:37.680 --> 06:46.000
Roger Vargas is up at bat. The pitcher winds up and strike one. A very nice curve ball by the

06:46.080 --> 06:53.680
pitcher. The catcher gives him the sign. He winds up. And Vargas gets a line drive.

06:54.400 --> 06:59.680
The players are scrambling to get the ball. Vargas gets to first base and he's still going.

06:59.680 --> 07:07.200
The outfielder throws it to second. Vargas slides. He's safe. Great play. We have a runner on third.

07:07.200 --> 07:15.360
And up at bat is Brian O'Kami. There's the pitch. He hits it. It's going. Going. That ball is gone.

07:15.440 --> 07:21.360
Home run by O'Kami. That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the

07:21.360 --> 07:23.520
fifth inning here at Richie Stadium.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.640
All right. So as we said, there are a lot of English terms that come from baseball,

07:34.640 --> 07:39.520
but we use them in business context or in your daily life, right? Yeah. Why don't we look at those

07:39.520 --> 07:47.200
now and fluency builder? Fluency builder. All right. So the first phrase that we have is

07:47.760 --> 07:55.200
up to bat. Up to bat. Up to bat. So literally in this dialogue, it means the guy is standing on

07:55.200 --> 08:00.160
home plate ready to hit the ball, right? He has the bat and he's ready to hit it. But what about

08:00.160 --> 08:06.480
in other contexts? So for example, you can be at a meeting and maybe it's your turn to talk.

08:06.480 --> 08:12.800
So you're up to bat. So the exactly your boss will say, okay, Erica, you're up to bat. Okay. So it

08:12.800 --> 08:17.360
means sort of like it's your turn. It's your turn. Yeah. Very good. All right. So that's another term

08:17.360 --> 08:24.240
that is using baseball, but very commonly used in other circumstances. So we also saw in the dialogue

08:24.240 --> 08:32.560
that Roger Vegas, he hit the ball, but he missed and that was strike one. Right. Strike one.

08:33.120 --> 08:39.360
So in baseball, you have three strikes. Three tries. Three tries before you're out. Yes. And so now

08:39.360 --> 08:47.440
the same thing happens in daily life. So if someone says, that was strike one. It means you made the

08:47.440 --> 08:53.040
first mistake. Yes. And if you make two more, you will be fired for example. Yeah. Or maybe your parents

08:53.040 --> 08:58.880
will say, okay, that wasn't nice. Strike one. And then two more times and you'll have a timeout.

08:58.880 --> 09:05.600
Oh, you'll be grounded. Yes. Okay. So that's also called a strike. And the picture through a

09:05.600 --> 09:12.880
curve ball curve ball. So okay, pretty clear. A curve ball is when you throw the ball and it sort of

09:12.880 --> 09:18.560
goes in a curve. It doesn't go straight. Right. Exactly. But how can this be used outside of baseball?

09:18.560 --> 09:24.560
So you can say, oh, my boss threw me a curve ball today. So he gave you an unexpected problem.

09:24.640 --> 09:30.320
Uh-huh. Or something that was difficult to handle. Okay. Um, this one is pretty interesting. I'd

09:30.320 --> 09:40.800
like to hear a few more examples. Example one. My boss threw me a curve ball today. So I have to

09:40.880 --> 09:53.680
stay and work late. Example two. It was a huge curve ball when she asked me how many kids I

09:53.680 --> 10:01.280
wanted to have. Oh, my, I'm supposed to know. All right. So that's basically a curve ball. You can say

10:01.280 --> 10:06.240
an unexpected problem in a situation. That's right. And our last phrase and we'll probably one

10:06.240 --> 10:12.400
that's you already know home run home run a home run from baseball. We know that that's when you

10:12.400 --> 10:17.840
hit the ball really far and you hit it outside of the of the playing area outside the park. Yes.

10:17.840 --> 10:23.680
And now if you use it in a business context or in your daily life, it means something similar.

10:23.680 --> 10:30.240
Why don't we take a listen to the examples and see if we can figure it out? Example one.

10:30.320 --> 10:40.160
Great job on that sales presentation. You really hit a home run. Example two.

10:44.080 --> 10:51.520
Our sales team hit a home run this month by doubling our revenue. Okay. So basically a home run is a

10:51.520 --> 10:57.440
success. A victory. A victory. Yeah. Something a big accomplishment. That's right. So we've seen a

10:57.440 --> 11:02.240
lot of these great phrases and as you can see, a lot of them from baseball are using your daily

11:02.240 --> 11:07.520
life and there are many, many more. Okay. Well, I don't we hear them again in the baseball context

11:07.520 --> 11:09.440
and we'll listen to the dialogue one more time.

11:20.320 --> 11:25.520
Hello baseball fans and welcome back to today's game. My name is Rick Fields and of course I am here

11:25.520 --> 11:30.160
once again with a man that seals the deal Bob Copeland. It's a beautiful day to see two world

11:30.160 --> 11:35.040
class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions. Well, the national

11:35.040 --> 11:41.840
anthem has just been sung and the Empire has started the game. It's time to play ball. Roger Vargas

11:41.840 --> 11:48.080
is up at bat. Picture winds up and strike one very nice curve ball by the pitcher. The catcher

11:48.080 --> 11:55.600
gives him the sign. He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive. The players are scrambling to get

11:55.600 --> 12:01.600
the ball. Vargas gets to first base and he's still doing it. The outfielder throws it to second.

12:01.600 --> 12:09.360
Vargas slides. He's safe. Great play. We have a runner on third and a bit bat is Brian O'Commie.

12:09.360 --> 12:17.520
There's the pitch. He hits it. It's going going. That ball is gone. Home run by O'Commie. That

12:17.840 --> 12:21.360
puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at the

12:21.360 --> 12:30.640
Richie Stadium. All right. So an interesting dialogue, a very interesting sport.

12:30.640 --> 12:36.720
Well, personally I never played this as a child. I mean either really. I don't really like it too much

12:36.720 --> 12:42.400
but it is kind of fun to go to a game and especially in the United States have those hot dogs

12:42.400 --> 12:47.920
in all that. Okay. Yep. Well, a cultural event. A really important piece of American culture.

12:47.920 --> 12:53.920
Exactly. So well, we encourage you to come to our website EnglishPod.com. Tell us what you think
