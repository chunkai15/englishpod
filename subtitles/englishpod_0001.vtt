00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
I'm Amira.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.500
And Amira and I are here today with a great, great lesson for you.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.500
Yes, we are.

00:15.500 --> 00:21.500
Today, we're going to be talking about a restaurant. Amira, why don't you give us a little bit more details?

00:21.500 --> 00:29.500
Well, we're talking about a situation in a restaurant and two people are involved, the waiter and the customer.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.000
And I don't want to say anymore.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Okay, don't say anymore. Let's just listen to this dialogue and we'll be back later to explain it.

00:44.500 --> 00:50.000
Good evening. My name is Fabio. I'll be your waiter for tonight. May I take your order?

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
No, I'm still working on it. This menu is not even in English. What's good here?

00:56.000 --> 01:00.500
For you, sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.500
Does it come with coconut fries?

01:03.500 --> 01:10.500
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

01:10.500 --> 01:15.500
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

01:15.500 --> 01:20.000
Excellent choice. Your order will be ready soon.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.500
How soon is soon?

01:22.500 --> 01:27.000
20 minutes? You know what? I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh, why do waiter?

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
What a waiter. He is really angry at this customer and I can't blame him. I would be angry too.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, so I think, Marco, you have chosen some interesting expressions for us here.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.500
What is the first one? Well, the first one is I'm still working on it.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.500
I'm still working on it. I'm still working on it.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.500
I'm still working on it.

02:02.500 --> 02:09.500
Why don't we listen to some other examples on how you can use this word and then we'll come back and explain it?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.500
Did you finish reading the magazine?

02:17.500 --> 02:19.500
I'm still working on it.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.500
Did you fix my car?

02:23.500 --> 02:25.500
I'm still working on it.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.500
Ah, so you could say I'm still working on it means I still need more time.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.500
Fantastic.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.500
Great. Okay, it's clear.

02:42.500 --> 02:48.000
I have another one for you guys. It's a phrase commonly used and you'll hear it all the time.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.500
Coke and fries.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.500
Coke and fries.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.500
Coke and fries.

02:52.500 --> 02:58.500
Coke and fries. It's a short way of saying Coca-Cola and French fries.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.500
So that's basically America's fast food.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.500
Yeah, Burger, Coke and fries.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.500
Okay. What's next on the menu?

03:06.500 --> 03:10.500
On the menu we have a complimentary glass of wine.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.500
Complementary glass of wine.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.500
Complementary glass of wine.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.500
Complementary means that it's free.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.500
Free.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.500
Yes.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.500
We love that, huh?

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
Yeah, we definitely like free things.

03:23.500 --> 03:27.500
Well, I have another one for us here. Another interesting phrase.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
I'll go with.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.500
I'll go with.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.500
I'll go with.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.500
I'll go with.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.500
So basically it's another way of saying I'm choosing.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.500
Yeah, I'll choose or I'll take.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.500
I'll take.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.500
Okay, very good.

03:41.500 --> 03:45.500
Alright, the next word that I want to take a look at is grab.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.500
Grab.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.500
Grab.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.500
Grab.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.500
Grab.

03:49.500 --> 03:57.100
Okay, now let's listen to some other examples of how we could use grab in different situations

03:57.100 --> 04:04.500
and then we'll come back and explain it.

04:04.500 --> 04:10.500
On your way home, can you grab some milk?

04:10.500 --> 04:11.500
Wait for me, please.

04:11.500 --> 04:17.500
I need to grab my coat.

04:17.500 --> 04:24.500
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

04:24.500 --> 04:29.500
Alright, well, I would understand that go grab means go get quickly.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.500
To go get quickly, yeah.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
Yeah.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.500
Alright, everyone.

04:33.500 --> 04:38.500
So now it's time to listen one more time to the dialogue and listen carefully and try to

04:38.500 --> 04:42.500
understand why the waiter doesn't like the customer.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.500
Let's listen.

04:45.500 --> 04:52.500
Good evening, my name is Fabio.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.500
I'll be your waiter for tonight.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.500
May I take your order?

04:55.500 --> 04:57.500
No, I'm still working on it.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.500
This man is not even in English.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.500
What's good here?

05:01.500 --> 05:06.500
For you, sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.500
Does it come with coconut fries?

05:09.500 --> 05:16.500
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

05:16.500 --> 05:21.500
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and wine.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.500
Excellent choice.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.500
Your order will be ready soon.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.500
How soon is soon?

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
20 minutes?

05:30.500 --> 05:31.500
You know what?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

05:33.500 --> 05:45.500
Marco, why did this waiter get angry at the customer?

05:45.500 --> 05:49.500
Well, he basically wasted the waiter's time.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.500
I mean, this guy comes into the restaurant.

05:51.500 --> 05:56.500
He is not very polite and he's asking all these questions.

05:56.500 --> 06:02.500
In the end, he just gets up and says, I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

06:02.500 --> 06:07.500
I also think that this guy was a lot more casual than the place he was in, right?

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
Yeah, yeah.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.500
I think this was a nice fancy restaurant.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.500
I think he was in the wrong place.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.500
Yeah.

06:14.500 --> 06:19.500
How many times, Marco, tell me, do you really have fast food a week?

06:19.500 --> 06:20.500
Fast food.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.500
Let's see Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.500
Oh, my God.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.500
No, no.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.500
I think I get fast food maybe once a week, once or twice a week.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
All right, talking about fast food made me hungry.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.500
So I think I'm going to go grab something to eat myself.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.500
Yeah, me too.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.500
All right.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
I hope you guys enjoyed the lesson today.

06:41.500 --> 06:46.500
And remember that all of this vocabulary is useful for your everyday needs.
