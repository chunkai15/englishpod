00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson here at English Pod, my name is Marko

00:07.360 --> 00:11.600
and my name is Katherine, hello everyone, today Marko, what are we talking about?

00:11.600 --> 00:16.400
Well, today we are not really in the best mood, what do we mean?

00:16.400 --> 00:24.560
We're kind of sad, we're kind of nervous, we're not feeling very well, it's a cloudy day, maybe that's why

00:24.640 --> 00:29.840
the blues, the blues, so yeah, that's what we're talking about today, we're going to have a lot of

00:29.840 --> 00:37.040
different descriptive words to express, maybe feeling sad, or maybe your angry or your nervous,

00:37.040 --> 00:42.000
or something like that. Hmm, okay, well, this is a very useful lesson hopefully, you're not feeling

00:42.000 --> 00:46.320
this vibe, but if you have to talk about someone who is, got lots of words for you, but first we're

00:46.320 --> 00:52.400
going to preview a couple in today's vocabulary preview. Very vocabulary preview. All right,

00:52.400 --> 00:57.280
so today I'm vocabulary preview, we're going to look at two words and the first one is a way of

00:57.280 --> 01:03.520
saying that you feel sad, so basically I'm feeling down. Okay, down, you might have heard this

01:03.520 --> 01:08.800
before because it's the opposite of the word up. Exactly. So you're not feeling up happy looking

01:08.800 --> 01:13.520
up, you're feeling down, this is another word for sad, like Marko said. Or you can also say,

01:13.520 --> 01:19.760
I'm a bit down today, right? Yeah, I'm a bit down today, or you look really down, are you okay?

01:19.840 --> 01:25.680
Yeah, so you look sad, are you, is everything okay? So down, so now another feeling or a way that a

01:25.680 --> 01:32.320
person is feeling, maybe that person is grouchy. Would you please stop talking so loud, Marko?

01:33.360 --> 01:40.320
I think you have, I'm seriously, don't be grouchy that, Angie. No, so grouchy is a way someone acts,

01:40.320 --> 01:46.160
usually when they're in a bad mood. Right, so it's not like really angry, you're not angry,

01:46.240 --> 01:51.760
but you're not very happy either. And you're not very nice to people. So there's a very famous

01:51.760 --> 01:58.480
TV character called Oscar The Grouch on Sesame Street. Look for him on YouTube or Yoku. And he's

01:58.480 --> 02:04.560
very, very good for learning about this feeling, grouchy, because he's a grouchy guy. Yeah,

02:04.560 --> 02:08.960
he's always angry, you're not never happy, basically. Right, it's always complaining about something.

02:08.960 --> 02:14.000
So that word again is grouchy. All right, so after taking a look at these two words,

02:14.080 --> 02:18.880
we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time. Let's see what this dialogue is about,

02:18.880 --> 02:22.000
if maybe they're grouchy or maybe just sad. Bye.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.680
Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.080
Cari, are you okay? You seem a bit down. I just got off the frame with my boyfriend.

02:36.880 --> 02:41.920
He's always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at times.

02:42.320 --> 02:48.400
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something. He does have a pretty nerve-wracking

02:48.400 --> 02:54.640
job, you know. Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood. I tried to find out what's bothering him,

02:54.640 --> 02:59.680
or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

03:00.400 --> 03:06.320
Men are like that, you know. They can feel nervous, anxious, or on edge, and the only way they can

03:06.320 --> 03:11.520
express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness. I guess you're right. What do you think I

03:11.520 --> 03:16.960
should do? It wasn't always as grouchy, you know. Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down,

03:16.960 --> 03:22.080
and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one. You have something else, you know that.

03:27.600 --> 03:33.760
All right, so two girls talking about guys. I guess guys have a bad temper sometimes, right?

03:33.760 --> 03:38.640
I think anyone can have a bad temper, but we're talking today about one of the boy

03:38.720 --> 03:43.200
friend of one of these girls who has a very bad temper and has been very grouchy recently.

03:43.840 --> 03:49.680
And that's why she's feeling a bit down. So let's take a look at those words now in language takeaway.

03:51.760 --> 03:57.440
Language takeaway. All right, so in today's language takeaway, we've got some wonderful words for

03:57.440 --> 04:03.440
you, words that are very good for describing stress or having anxiety. And the first

04:03.520 --> 04:07.360
of these words is something you hear all the time, especially with young people.

04:07.920 --> 04:15.360
Right, somebody is stressed out. My gosh, Marco, I'm so stressed out. I have 10 homework assignments

04:15.360 --> 04:20.720
to do and softball practice, and my mom wants me to help cook dinner tonight.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.920
You really are stressed out. I don't have any homework, and I don't live with my mom.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.680
But being stressed out is usually something you feel when you have too much stuff to do.

04:32.320 --> 04:38.160
So maybe you can be stressed out because of school, like in your case, or maybe at work,

04:38.160 --> 04:43.840
you have a lot of things to do or a project to finish, right? Exactly. And I just want to point

04:43.840 --> 04:50.960
out here that you can say I'm stressed or I'm feeling stressed, but commonly in spoken English.

04:50.960 --> 04:54.880
So when you're talking to your friends, you hear this much more often stressed out.

04:54.880 --> 05:00.000
Stress down. He's really stressed out lately. All right. So we're stressed out or another word

05:00.080 --> 05:04.080
that kind of means the same is this is nerve-wracking.

05:04.080 --> 05:09.440
nerve-wracking. So nerves are those things in our body that help us feel things, right?

05:09.440 --> 05:15.680
And so something that racks our nerves makes us very, very tense, very anxious, very uncomfortable.

05:15.680 --> 05:20.640
Okay. So it makes you very nervous. Right. So there are some movies that are nerve-wracking. For

05:20.640 --> 05:26.720
example, suspense movies like Hitchcock's movies like Psycho or The Birds.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.360
Or like horror, like maybe saw.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.560
nerve-wracking. Also some people think that roller coasters are nerve-wracking. They're very,

05:35.600 --> 05:41.360
anxious when they ride roller coasters. Right. So let's listen to a couple of more examples of

05:41.360 --> 05:46.880
in different situations where we can use this phrase nerve-wracking. Example one.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.000
I think being a doctor is one of the most nerve-wracking jobs in the world.

05:52.880 --> 06:00.640
Example two. Skydiving is one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of my life. I almost had

06:00.640 --> 06:10.240
a heart attack. Example three. The final match between Brazil and Italy was incredibly nerve-wracking.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.720
And there's another way to describe this feeling again. It's a little bit different but very,

06:16.800 --> 06:23.600
very similar. We can say someone is feeling on edge. On edge. So this person was feeling on edge.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.440
But what does that mean exactly? You're like at the end. Why do you have to ask so many questions?

06:29.440 --> 06:36.480
Okay. Listen. This is basic. Okay, Marco. Are you locking me? On edge today.

06:37.200 --> 06:44.160
All right. So someone who is on edge is easily angered. Right. So it's very easy to make this person

06:44.240 --> 06:51.600
upset or angry. Someone who just quit smoking might be on edge. That means it's very, very easy

06:51.600 --> 06:59.600
to get them to be upset. Wow. So yeah, you are on edge, right? Exactly. He's on edge or he

06:59.600 --> 07:06.160
seems on edge doesn't he? Hmm. Okay. Very good. Wow. These three words that we've just looked at

07:06.160 --> 07:11.680
are really interesting and very, very useful. I guess you can describe many different situations

07:11.680 --> 07:17.280
or a person that's going through these feelings, right? Absolutely. I think there are a thousand ways

07:17.280 --> 07:23.520
to describe being nervous or anxious or upset. So they wish to take another listen to today's

07:23.520 --> 07:27.600
dialogue and figure out how exactly we use these words and we come back. We're talking about

07:27.600 --> 07:37.120
some other phrases that are useful. Okay. I'll talk to you later. Bye.

07:37.520 --> 07:43.440
Kerry, are you okay? You seem a bit down. I just got to have the frame with my boyfriend.

07:44.320 --> 07:49.360
He's always getting upset and losing his temper of nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at times.

07:50.880 --> 07:55.840
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something. He does have a pretty nerve-racking

07:55.840 --> 08:02.240
job, you know. Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him.

08:03.040 --> 08:07.040
Get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

08:07.840 --> 08:12.480
Men are like that, you know. They can feel nervous, anxious, or on-edge,

08:12.480 --> 08:17.520
and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness. I guess you're right.

08:18.320 --> 08:23.520
What do you think I should do? He wasn't always as grouchy, you know. Talk to him, try to cheer him up

08:23.520 --> 08:28.720
when he's down and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one. He was something

08:28.720 --> 08:29.520
else, you know that.

08:35.760 --> 08:41.840
All right, great. So now that we're back, we can start with a couple of different phrases now on fluency

08:41.840 --> 08:50.320
builder. Fluency builder. All right, so Marco, here's the big question. What makes you lose your temper?

08:51.280 --> 08:59.360
Hmm, I think what makes me lose my temper very, very easily is like a dirty house,

08:59.360 --> 09:05.520
like a dirty room. Really, you're in a neat freak. Not really neat freak, but like if it's not

09:05.520 --> 09:12.800
at least semi-clean, you know, it really, it really bothers me. Okay, so this great phrase,

09:12.800 --> 09:18.560
lose your temper or lose one's temper is is a phrase we use in English to describe

09:18.640 --> 09:22.880
getting angry. All right, so maybe you're okay, you're a little frustrated with something, but

09:22.880 --> 09:26.560
someone does something like throws all of their clothes on the floor. Marco here says,

09:27.760 --> 09:32.240
that's it. I'm tired of this. You're always throwing your clothes on the floor and that's

09:32.240 --> 09:36.800
that's an example of Marco losing his temper. What about you? What makes you lose your temper?

09:36.800 --> 09:45.520
You hear this? What is that? Oh, drilling construction? When people tap tap tap tap tap tap or when they

09:45.600 --> 09:51.840
like stomp their feet when they're nervous. When they make noise, yeah. So slowly, it's like,

09:51.840 --> 09:57.760
okay, fine, calm down. It's okay. Okay, no, seriously, stop it. See, and then all of a sudden,

09:57.760 --> 10:04.800
I just can't stand it anymore. You explode exactly, so. All right, so that's what makes you lose your

10:04.800 --> 10:10.000
temper. I'll be sure to keep in my eye out for that and not have my pain. All right, all right,

10:10.000 --> 10:15.120
so okay, you lose your temper and now there are situations sometimes where you need to

10:15.120 --> 10:21.440
brush someone off. All right, or when you get brushed off and that's not very good feeling.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.600
But this phrase to brush someone off, you've heard the word brush before. It's the word that we use to,

10:25.600 --> 10:30.320
to, you know, brush your hair or brush your teeth exactly. When you brush someone off,

10:30.320 --> 10:35.120
it's like saying that you're ignoring them. Yeah, so you ignore them or you basically tell them

10:35.120 --> 10:40.000
to go away very subtly sometimes or very directly. Exactly, and so to brush someone off

10:40.000 --> 10:44.240
is to avoid their company. And so a lot of times when people are angry, they like to be alone,

10:44.320 --> 10:49.280
so they brush you off. So I could say, hey, did you want to go see that movie tonight?

10:49.280 --> 10:54.880
Oh, no, I can't. I have to do something tonight. And then Marco walks away while we're talking.

10:54.880 --> 11:00.640
He's brushing me off. He's ignoring me. Yeah, so it happens and also maybe some people can make

11:00.640 --> 11:06.240
up excuses and that's also brushing someone off, right? Exactly. So to brush someone off or

11:06.240 --> 11:12.800
he brushed me off, doesn't feel good. All right, and well, all of these, all of these bad

11:12.960 --> 11:18.240
feelings brushing somebody off. Maybe you feel stressed out. In the end, you always need a good

11:18.240 --> 11:23.120
friend to cheer you up, right? And that's what this dialogue is all about. Exactly. And so friends

11:23.120 --> 11:27.680
are actually the people that do that the best or family, I think. And well, we can break this

11:27.680 --> 11:32.960
phrase down because most of it's pretty clear, but cheer. My knee a new word for some of our

11:32.960 --> 11:37.200
listen. Maybe we've heard of the term cheer leader, you know, like, give me an egg. Hey,

11:37.360 --> 11:44.720
hey, hey, or, or people cheering or cheers when the beer. Yeah. So cheer is like happiness. So

11:44.720 --> 11:50.160
someone who can cheer you up is someone who makes you happy. I remember that down. We had earlier.

11:50.160 --> 11:55.040
I'm feeling down. We're trying to cheer someone up. We're trying to make them go up and be happy.

11:55.040 --> 11:58.720
Exactly. So you want to cheer up your friends or maybe if you're feeling a bit down,

11:58.720 --> 12:03.040
a family member will try and cheer you up. Do you need someone to cheer you up, Marco?

12:03.760 --> 12:08.480
Yeah. So you do. Well, let's go have a drink and eat some popcorn and be cheered up. That's

12:08.480 --> 12:13.680
what cheers me up or chocolate. Oh, cheers me up. Oh, I know where there's some of that. All right. So

12:13.680 --> 12:19.200
we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases, but the last sentence of the dialogue is maybe a

12:19.200 --> 12:23.920
little bit strange, right? When she says, you are something else. You know that?

12:24.960 --> 12:30.560
Something what? Like, she annihilated. What does she mean when she says, you are something else? That's a

12:30.560 --> 12:35.520
great question. Well, this might be a little bit hard to understand at first, but she's saying,

12:35.520 --> 12:40.720
I can't believe you. There's no one like you. You're really something else. You know that. So it's

12:40.720 --> 12:46.400
kind of like a joke, but what she's saying is, I can't believe you. You just want to go on

12:46.400 --> 12:52.720
and encourage me to find another boy. You're unbelievable. So it could be, is it on a positive note

12:52.720 --> 12:56.800
or can it be both positive and negative? Well, here we've got two friends who are using it,

12:56.800 --> 13:01.680
so it's a positive note, but she's kind of making fun of her saying, I can't believe you. But it

13:01.680 --> 13:07.280
can be negative, like you can be more negative. Biting with her boyfriend and her boyfriend

13:07.280 --> 13:11.840
cheats on her and she's like, you're really something else. You know, you are something else. You know that.

13:11.840 --> 13:17.840
It's like, there's no comparison. You're the worst. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, it really depends on

13:17.840 --> 13:22.960
how this is used and what the tone of voice is, so how someone says it. But in this case,

13:22.960 --> 13:28.240
I think it's like the joke joke, but it's, it's the positive writing. Very interesting. It's

13:28.240 --> 13:32.720
very spoken English, as you say, because all the words that we see, they're pretty simple,

13:32.720 --> 13:37.680
but the context or the connotation, the meaning is very, very different from the actual words.

13:37.680 --> 13:43.120
Exactly. All right. So let's listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk

13:43.120 --> 13:43.920
a little bit more.

13:43.920 --> 13:53.920
Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

13:53.920 --> 14:00.960
Carrie, are you okay? You seem a bit down. I just got off the frame with my boyfriend. He's always

14:00.960 --> 14:05.920
getting upset and losing his temper of nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at times.

14:05.920 --> 14:11.600
Maybe it's just that he's stressed out from working or something. He does have a pretty nerve

14:11.920 --> 14:17.520
wrecking job, you know. Yeah, but he's always in a really foul mood. I tried to find out what's

14:17.520 --> 14:23.200
bothering him or get him to talk about his day, but he always shuts down and brushes me off.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.840
Men are like that, you know. They can feel nervous, anxious, or on edge, and the only way they can

14:29.840 --> 14:35.120
express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness. I guess you're right. What do you think I

14:35.120 --> 14:40.720
should do? He wasn't always as grouchy, you know. Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he's down, and

14:40.800 --> 14:45.680
if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one. You have something else, you know that.

14:52.560 --> 14:56.640
So Katherine, are you a grouchy person? Are you happy? Do you have a bad temper?

14:57.360 --> 15:01.520
Oh, these are, well, very interesting questions, Mark. Thank you for asking. You know, the first,

15:01.520 --> 15:06.080
the first time am I grouchy, no, not very only before 9 a.m. You're not a morning person?

15:06.160 --> 15:11.120
Not a morning person, so I'm very grouchy in the morning, but I'm generally pretty good about

15:11.120 --> 15:15.920
losing my temper or it doesn't happen very often. But I do get frustrated with things like

15:15.920 --> 15:21.440
tapping or when people eat with their mouth open. Oh, yeah, that's terrible. I hate that as well.

15:21.440 --> 15:26.160
Yeah, I can't stand it. Or I don't really don't like when people bite their nails. It's kind of,

15:26.160 --> 15:31.200
but it also makes me lose my temper. I don't know, it more than makes me lose my temper. It's kind of annoying,

15:31.200 --> 15:35.440
right? It is annoying. So what makes you really lose your temper? We say, what makes you blow your

15:35.520 --> 15:44.160
top? Think about an volcano. Really grinds my gears. Yeah. I would say the worst is when somebody

15:44.160 --> 15:48.400
lies to me, like the straight in my face, like I know they're lying. I know you're lying in these

15:48.400 --> 15:53.600
still just lies straight at me. I agree. So what's something that really cheers you up?

15:53.600 --> 15:57.280
Because we talked about like going out with a friend maybe helps you to help to cheer up. But is there

15:57.280 --> 16:04.080
one thing? Some kind of remedy? I'm actually, I like to go shopping when I'm really. Really?

16:05.040 --> 16:09.280
I mean, I won't buy anything like clothes or anything like that. Usually I'll get maybe

16:09.280 --> 16:13.520
something for somebody else or for the house or something. It's very strange. Well, she like clear your

16:13.520 --> 16:17.600
