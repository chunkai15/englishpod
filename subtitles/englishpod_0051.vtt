00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
And today we're bringing you another great lesson and this time we're going to be shopping.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.120
That's right. Actually a lot of our users asked for some lessons about shopping, right?

00:15.120 --> 00:20.000
Exactly. And I think one of the most important things when you go shopping is to get a good price.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.360
That's right. So we're going to be teaching you how to bargain.

00:23.360 --> 00:28.480
So Marco, you just mentioned a really great word. Let's look at it in vocabulary preview.

00:29.120 --> 00:35.200
Very cablery preview. All right. So we're going to preview the word bargain today.

00:35.200 --> 00:40.640
bargain bargain bargain. Now this is an interesting word because it's a verb and noun.

00:40.640 --> 00:46.080
That's right. So a bargain is a good price, right?

00:46.080 --> 00:53.440
Okay. So a bargain is a good price. Yeah. This t-shirt was a bargain. I only paid a dollar for it.

00:53.440 --> 00:59.840
Okay. So that is a bargain. Yeah. But two bargain as a verb to try and get a good price.

00:59.840 --> 01:04.880
So it's very similar to negotiate. Yeah. So I would say it costs $100.

01:04.880 --> 01:10.080
And then I would say maybe it no, I'll give you 50. 75. And then I'll say 60.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.440
Et cetera. Et cetera. And that's two bargain, right?

01:13.440 --> 01:18.560
Okay. So we're going to be bargaining. Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time as we have a woman

01:18.560 --> 01:20.400
bargaining in a store, right? That's right.

01:28.720 --> 01:33.280
Hello, may help you? Yeah. This dress is really nice. How much is it?

01:33.280 --> 01:39.920
That one is $150. 150. What about this other one over here?

01:39.920 --> 01:46.160
That's 140. That's a piece of house in my price range. Can you give me a better deal?

01:47.040 --> 01:52.240
This is an exclusive design by Damatko. It's a bargain at that price.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.600
Well, I don't know. I think I'll shop around.

01:55.600 --> 02:00.320
Okay. Okay. How about $100? That's still more than I want to spend.

02:01.360 --> 02:07.840
What if I take both dresses? Okay. I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

02:08.160 --> 02:15.040
100 and 90 for both. I don't know. Still a bit pricey. Thanks anyway.

02:15.040 --> 02:20.160
Okay. My final price. $100 for both. That's two for the price of one. And that's my last offer.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.680
Great. You close a deal.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.720
All right. That was some good bargaining skills right there.

02:28.720 --> 02:33.200
Yeah. And you know what? She used a lot of good language to get a cheaper price, didn't she?

02:33.200 --> 02:37.680
Yeah. Yeah. That was good. So let's take a look at this language in language takeaway.

02:38.640 --> 02:46.720
Language takeaway. Okay. The first word we have in language takeaway today, price range.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.480
Price range. Price range. Price range. Price range.

02:50.480 --> 02:56.240
Price range. What does that mean exactly? So price range is the minimum and the maximum that you're

02:56.240 --> 03:01.440
willing to spend or a thing that you want to buy. Exactly. So in the dialogue we heard,

03:01.440 --> 03:06.880
it's out of my price range. It's more than I can spend. More than I could spend. Yeah. Okay.

03:06.960 --> 03:11.600
Okay. Let's look at her next word. Shop around. Shop around. Shop around.

03:11.600 --> 03:18.000
Shop around. So she said, I think I think I'll shop around. Right. So she wants to check in a

03:18.000 --> 03:23.120
few other stores to see if there's a better price. If I shop around, I'm going and trying to

03:23.120 --> 03:28.480
compare prices maybe. Exactly. This is a really good shopping technique. Yeah. It is.

03:28.480 --> 03:34.000
Yeah. Okay. And let's look at her last word. Pricey. Pricey. Pricey.

03:34.960 --> 03:41.280
So something that's pricey is expensive. Expensive. Yep. This is a more sort of informal way of saying

03:41.280 --> 03:46.800
expensive. Exactly. So instead of saying, wow, that car is really expensive. It's really pricey.

03:46.800 --> 03:51.120
It's really pricey. Yeah. Okay. Let's listen to her dialogue for the second time and it's going

03:51.120 --> 03:55.840
to be slowed down a bit. So you'll understand some of these great words a little bit better.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.200
Hello. May I help you? Yeah. This dress is really nice.

04:03.760 --> 04:11.760
How much is it? That one is $150. $150. What about this other one over here?

04:12.560 --> 04:19.920
That's 140. Hmm. That's a bit out of my price range. Can you give me a better deal?

04:21.120 --> 04:26.160
This is an exclusive design by Damalko. It's a bargain at that price.

04:26.640 --> 04:34.080
Hmm. Well, I don't know. I think I'll shop around. Okay. Okay. How about $100?

04:35.280 --> 04:44.160
That's still more than I wanted to spend. What if I take both dresses? Okay. I can give you a special

04:44.160 --> 04:53.120
discount just because you seem like a nice person. $190 for both. I don't know. It's still a bit

04:53.200 --> 05:01.920
pricey. Thanks anyway. Okay. My final price. $100 for both. That's two for the price of one.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.120
That's my last offer. Great. You've got to deal.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.360
So we've covered the language in this dialogue. Now let's take a look at some of the phrases

05:13.360 --> 05:21.040
in putting it together. Put it in yet together. So Marko in this dialogue there's a lot of

05:21.120 --> 05:28.560
really useful phrases to help you get a better price when you shop, right? Exactly. So the first

05:28.560 --> 05:35.440
one we have is, can you give me a better deal? Can you give me a better deal?

05:36.080 --> 05:41.680
So if I'm shopping and something is too expensive, I would use this sentence with the shopkeeper.

05:41.680 --> 05:47.600
Yeah. So you might say, hey, this is out of my price range. Could you give me a better deal?

05:47.680 --> 05:53.200
Can you give me a better deal? Yeah. Okay. We have some examples of can you give me a better deal?

05:53.200 --> 06:02.640
Let's listen. Example one. I really like this shirt, but it's too expensive. Can you give me a better deal?

06:06.000 --> 06:13.440
Example two. Can you give me a better price on this car? I really don't have that much money.

06:14.080 --> 06:23.200
So you can see here that you can say, can you give me a better deal? Or can you give me a better price?

06:23.200 --> 06:27.680
All right. Let's take a look at the next phrase. That's still more than I wanted to spend.

06:27.680 --> 06:33.520
That's still more than I wanted to spend. That's still more than I wanted to spend.

06:33.520 --> 06:39.680
So if this seller suggests a really high price, you can say that's still more than I wanted to spend.

06:39.680 --> 06:45.440
So basically you're telling the shopkeeper, still too expensive. You still don't want to spend that much.

06:46.400 --> 06:52.080
All right. Let's take a look at our last phrase. That's my last offer. That's my last offer.

06:52.080 --> 06:56.800
That's my last offer. Now this could work both ways. It could be the shopkeeper that's telling you that.

06:56.800 --> 07:02.880
That's my lowest price. Right? Or you could say, that's my last offer. That's my highest price if you are buying it.

07:02.880 --> 07:07.600
Right. Because sometimes when you're bargaining, the shopkeeper will say, all right, what's your best offer?

07:07.760 --> 07:15.200
How much will you pay? $100. That's my final offer. Exactly. All right. So we've looked at a lot of great phrases and words.

07:15.200 --> 07:21.440
And now you're ready to bargain and also listen to this dialogue for the third time. And then we'll come back and talk some more.

07:25.680 --> 07:32.160
Hello, may help you? Yeah. This dress is really nice. How much is it? That one is $150.

07:32.480 --> 07:38.160
$150. What about this other one over here? That's $140.

07:38.160 --> 07:43.200
Um, that's the best house in my price range. Can you give me a better deal?

07:44.000 --> 07:49.200
This is an exclusive design by Damarko. It's a bargain at that price.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.400
Well, I don't know. I think I'll shop around.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.480
Okay, okay. How about a hundred dollars?

07:55.120 --> 07:59.840
That's still more than I want to spend. What if I take both dresses?

08:00.800 --> 08:04.480
Okay, I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

08:05.200 --> 08:13.520
190 for both. I don't know. Still a bit pricey. Thanks anyway. Okay, my final price.

08:13.520 --> 08:18.480
$100 for both. That's two for the price of one. And that's my last offer. Right. You goes a deal.

08:22.720 --> 08:29.360
All right. So I know that in Canada, it's not really common to bargain, right? No. It really isn't like even when you go to the market

08:29.440 --> 08:35.440
to buy fruits and vegetables. It's very, very rare to bargain with a shop or have one in Ecuador.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.520
No, in Ecuador, you definitely bargain. Really? Well, if you go to the mall, for example,

08:39.520 --> 08:44.080
or if you go to a supermarket, of course, you wouldn't really bargain. Yeah. Unless maybe you go to a

08:44.080 --> 08:49.840
small store or you go to one of the local markets, then it's more common to bargain. And you have

08:49.840 --> 08:54.480
to because people expect you to bargain. Really? Yeah, in many countries in the world,

08:54.560 --> 08:59.520
bargaining is almost like an art. Yeah, that's true. Actually, Marco, you are an excellent bargain.

09:01.360 --> 09:07.200
Yeah, I've been known to bargain with the shopkeepers in, uh, I've been known to bargain a little bit

09:07.200 --> 09:11.680
with with the shopkeepers and helping out a little bit. I mean, you've got better prices than I can

09:11.680 --> 09:18.880
even imagine getting. Yeah, that's a good story. We'll get JP to to go to our common section and tell

09:18.880 --> 09:23.840
you about that. So we want to know about your countries. Is it common to bargain? Do you really do it?
