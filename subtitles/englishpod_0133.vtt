00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to English, my name is Marco and my name is Catherine and today we're talking about being clean

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Yeah, we're going to be doing the laundry, right? It's a very important part of everyone's weekly schedule

00:16.000 --> 00:27.000
And not only important, but I find it to be a little bit difficult because you know like washing machine and what clothes you should mix with what and you know how much detergent and how long it's such a complicated process

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Well, let's say this, it might not be difficult, but it's very easy to mess up

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
Exactly, yeah, that's the problem. It's very easy to like just ruin your favorite t-shirt if you don't do laundry correctly

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Or all of your white socks turn pink, for example

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Right, so we're going to be looking at a lot of vocabulary and phrases related to this topic

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
And before we get started with the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Very vocabulary preview

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
Okay, so central to all of these phrases and words that we're going to be hearing is a thing and electric thing that helps us wash our clothes

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Right, a washing machine

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
All right, pretty simple, right? So washing is to wash washing and machine so they go together washing machine

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Right, so it's easy now. You just put all your clothes in this thing and it washes it for you

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
No, you know a lot of people don't like to use washing machines. They say it doesn't really clean the clothes as well as doing it by hand

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Really, well, I'd say most clothes get get washed pretty well with the washing machine, but if you have those hard to

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Hard to get stains or some dirt, maybe it's good to have a washing board

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
A washing board, yeah, yeah, where you can really scrub it yourself

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
And we'll funny you mentioned that word stain because it's our second word that we're going to preview a stain

01:45.000 --> 01:54.000
All right, a stain is some color, maybe some food or wine or grass that you can't remove from your clothes

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Right, so it's very common you're having a nice dinner and all of a sudden you spill wine on your shirt

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
So you have a wine stain

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
I hate that and you can also have stain on your you can also have a stain on your carpet

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Right, so if you spill some coffee on your carpet, it's got a little circle that's brown forever

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Right, or you know even some people have stained teeth, right?

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
That's right, so you can get them turned back white with a little money to your dentist

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Exactly, so those are the two words that we're going to be looking at today in vocabulary preview

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
So let's listen to our dialogue, let's see what's happening with these people that are doing laundry

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Okay, let's go through this one more time

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I don't want any more ruined or dyed blouses

02:44.000 --> 02:54.000
I know, I know, okay, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Right, you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you're washing

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
For example, for delegates, you should set a shorter washing cycle

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
So complicated

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Okay, what about this red wine stain?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
How do I get it out?

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Cool, then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set, right?

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
No, since you're washing delegates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for 20 minutes

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
You know what, I'll just have everything dry cleaned

03:31.000 --> 03:41.000
Okay, so you've got someone who is maybe doing the laundry for the first time

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
And he's not really understanding the instructions

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Well, that's the thing I tell you, it's a little bit difficult

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
And well, it's very tedious at times to try and do laundry like this

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
Well, the first thing it's maybe tedious about it is that you have to really worry about what colors go together

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
Right, so let's take a look at those words that were related to doing laundry now in language takeaway

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Language takeaway

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
Okay, the first word we have is actually related to a joke we made earlier about pink socks

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
So if you change the color of something, you're dying it

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
Okay, die, so it's pronounced exactly the same way as, you know, to die to not live anymore

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
But it's spelled differently

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Why?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Okay, so it can be a verb or an adjective

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Or an noun

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Or an noun

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
So something that you put on clothes to change the color is called a dye

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
A dye

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
But to do this, to change the color of some clothes is to dye the clothes

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
So that's maybe what happens when you wash a red t-shirt with all your white t-shirts

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
And you have dyeed shirts, pink shirts and now

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
And also women when they go to the beauty salon, they dye their hair

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Exactly, so that means you change the color of your hair

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
It means it's a long-term change, it's not short, it's not like one day

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Right, it means probably for a long time

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
So that's the correct word to dye

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Very different, maybe some people say to paint

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Which you know, we understand, but the correct form would be to dye

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
And next we have a word that describes a certain kind of clothing

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
We're not talking about pants or socks, we're talking about delicate

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
So now this adjective delicate, which means it's very easy to break

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Fradule, right?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
But this is a noun, delicate

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Right, so you think of something that's easy to break or to ruin

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Maybe you think of underwear

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Underwear

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Underwear is something you wear under your clothing

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
And so it's generally not as strong as a shirt or a pair of jeans

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
And so we call these in English, delicate

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Very good

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
So you have to be careful when you're washing your delicate

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Because it's happened to me before you put them in with all the clothes

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And then you have stretched out boxes or something like that

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, so that's why many women I know wash delicate by hand

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
So you separate the clothes from the delicate

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Very good

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
And now if you're washing delicate or washing towels or t-shirts

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
It's always a good idea to use fabric softener

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Alright fabric softener, what are these two words?

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
One of them you understand already, maybe it's soft softener

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
So it makes it soft

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, something that makes something softer

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
We've got fabric softener, so that's something that makes the clothes that you wash softener

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
So fabric is any type of material, like a textile

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, so it could be cotton or silk

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Or nylon

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Linnon, so these are all kinds of fabrics

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
So you pour a little bit of this in your washing machine

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
And your clothes come out really nice and soft

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Mmm, it feels nice just talking about it

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Alright, and we'll also to wash your clothes

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
So actually make them clean, you use detergent

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Right, so many people might want to say the word soap

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Because soap is what we use to wash our hands

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
And our dishes, but here we have detergent

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
So this is a special soap for your clothes

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Right, laundry detergent

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, you could just say laundry detergent or simply detergent

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
And now in order to remove those nasty stains

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
That maybe are very hard, you would use a chemical called bleach

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Alright, so bleach is the dangerous chemical

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Because it smells very strong

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
Right, and it can change the color of your clothes to white or yellow

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
So we usually only use bleach with white clothes

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I actually had a friend who changed the color of his hair to white

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Using bleach, he put bleach on his head and on his hair and it just turned white

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Oh wow, so many people do that because they want to go from dark colors to light colors

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
And in that case you wouldn't say you could say that he dyed his hair white

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
But usually you would say he bleached his hair

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
It's so we understand that it turned white

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Exactly

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
So those five words we just looked at in language takeaway

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
They're important they're related to doing laundry

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
So before we move on, let's listen to our dialogue again

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
But a little bit slower

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
Okay, let's go through this one more time

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
I don't want any more ruined or dyed blouses

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I know, I know

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Okay, so I have to separate the colors from the whites

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
And put them in a strange looking contraption so called washing machine

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Right, you have to turn it on and program it

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Depending on what type of clothes you are washing

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
For example, for delegates, you should set a shorter washing cycle

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
So complicated

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Okay, what about this red wine stain?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
How do I get it out?

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And it will do the trick

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Cool

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And it's all set, right?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
No

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Since you're washing delegates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And for 20 minutes

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
You know what?

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I'll just have everything dry clean

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
So here at English Pop, we'd like to also provide you listeners

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
With some phrases that allow you to increase your fluencies

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
That means sound more like a native English speaker

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
And so today let's check out these phrases in Fluency Builder

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Fluency Builder

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
Alright, so on Fluency Builder we're going to be looking at four words or four phrases

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
So the first one was really easy when she was telling the guy

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Or instructing him how to do the laundry

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
She said, let's go through this one more time

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Go through what?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
The wall?

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
No, so it's not actually to go through an object like to pass

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
So let's repeat or let's rehearse again

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Okay, so normally we say this when there are many different steps to do something

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
So let's go through this again

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
When you leave work you go home

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
You unlock the door

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
You open the door

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
And so it means that there's a process

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
There are many steps

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
So let's go through this again

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
As a way for us to say let's think about and discuss this process

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Very good, so we also use it maybe when we're studying

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So let's go through this subject one more time

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Can we go through chapter five again?

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Exactly, so you would reread a chapter five

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Alright, so why don't we listen to a couple of more examples of how we could use go through

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Example one

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
I want to go through chapter five again before the exam tomorrow

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Example two

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
David, do you have time this afternoon to go over the details of this new project?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Example three

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
I went through my contract and it says that I am entitled to 15 vacation days a year

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Now this next phrase is very common when we're using sarcasm

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
And when we're trying to make jokes, so we say so called

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Right, so she said this so called contraption

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
It's like she doubts that it's really a washing machine

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
So I could say her so called boyfriend wants to go out tonight

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
So I say that because he doesn't really act like a boyfriend

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
So you're being sarcastic

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
It's a very good way in easy way of demonstrating sarcasm

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
Yeah, actually in 1990s in America there was a very famous TV show called my so called light

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Mm-hmm, right?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
So this is my so called life

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
It's almost like it's not really like I have any control over it

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
No, I don't really have a life because it's kind of boring

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah, so my so called life not bragging it's a joke

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
So you can say it my so called friends my so called job

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Basically, you can almost be sarcastic with anything

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, but be careful that you know that it's a joke because if you're trying to be serious

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
You might make some people angry

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Right, and now well, she was explaining the whole process of how to do it

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
And when she recommended using bleach she said that should do the trick trick

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
So dogs do tricks, right?

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Right, but to do the trick, right?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
What is that different meaning?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
All right, so she's saying this should work. This should fix your problem

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Mm-hmm, so that should do the trick

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
So Marco, I've been having this itch on my foot and I just can't I can't seem just to figure out what to do with it

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Do you have any suggestions?

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah, you should maybe just put some ointment on it and I should do the trick

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
All right, cool. Thanks for this suggestion

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, so very easy is just a way of saying that should solve your problem

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
All right, great. So that should do the trick or it will do the trick

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
Mm-hmm, and what we have one last phrase all set all set

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
So this is another phrase that that has two words that always go together to mean

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
Well, we're finished. We're done everything is ready everything is ready

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
We're all set to go on vacation

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
So my bags are packed. I have my passport. We are all set

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Or after meeting you can say are we all set here? That means are we finished?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Is it time to leave?

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
Very good. So we are almost all set. Let's listen to this dialogue one last time

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Okay, let's go through this one more time

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
I don't want any more ruined or died blouses. I know I know okay

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
So I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
So called washing machine

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
Right, you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you're washing

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
For example for delegates you should set a shorter washing cycle

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
Also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing so complicated

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Okay, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Since this is a white t-shirt you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And it will do the trick cool

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set, right?

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
No, since you're washing delegates and cotton you should set the dryer to medium heat and for 20 minutes

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
You know what? I'll just have everything dry cleaned

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
Have you ever had any laundry mishaps? Have you ever lost a sock died something?

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
Have I ever? I hate doing the laundry

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Why?

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
So it's time consuming it takes a lot of time and I just I have no patience

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
And so normally when I was in college I would take all of my laundry in a bag

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
And I'd throw in the washing machine and I'd put it on cold

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
You know because cold water it's okay for all colors

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
But hot water makes the colors bleed

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
I took out the clothes and put them in the dryer and afterwards

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
I saw all my clothes were clean except for my three sweaters, which were small enough for babies

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
Oh, you broke it. Yeah, I shrunk three of brand new sweaters

15:13.000 --> 15:20.000
Oh, nice to have that the problem that I have when doing laundry is that I forget that I started doing laundry

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
So all of a sudden, you know, I'm doing laundry in the morning and then

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Closer or washed but they're still in the washing machine

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And I remember like the next day

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
So then the clothes are like kind of smelling like kind of humid

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Because they're moldy

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
Yeah, so I have to re wash them and just like a pain

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah, but doing laundry is sometimes so time consuming

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
But let us know what you think do you like doing laundry or have you ever lost a sock

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
I think everyone has lost a sock or something in the washing right?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I think there's a secret home for socks somewhere

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Maybe it's an Australia

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
