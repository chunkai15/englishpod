Hello English learners. Welcome back to English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.500
And I'm Erica.

00:06.500 --> 00:11.500
And we're going to be looking at our fifth episode of our famous love story.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.500
Yes. I'm sorry. I love you.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.000
Okay. Part five.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
So if you haven't listened to the first four, I suggest you go do that first because you're going to be a little bit lost.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.500
But it's getting really good.

00:24.500 --> 00:29.500
Yeah. And so, so good that I don't think we can even say what's going to happen next.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.000
We can't say the key language.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Yeah. We can't preview anything because it's we want to surprise you.

00:36.000 --> 00:36.500
Yes.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.000
But we can tell you this. What's going on?

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
The last time we saw Veronica and Steven. They broke up, right?

00:43.000 --> 00:43.500
Right.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.000
And Veronica was with her friend and feeling really terrible.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.500
And then Steven suddenly came to sing a beautiful song.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.500
So this is continuing on that.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.500
Right. Okay.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.000
So let's listen to the dialogue.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
And then we'll come back and talk about some of the difficult vocabulary we might find.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.500
Sure.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.500
Thank you.

01:01.500 --> 01:05.500
Thank you.

01:05.500 --> 01:10.500
Honey, of course I forgive you.

01:10.500 --> 01:14.000
I love you so much. I really missed you.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I was wrong to get upset over nothing.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm sorry I haven't called anything.

01:19.000 --> 01:28.500
But right after you decided you wanted to break, I was up north to put out some major forest fires.

01:28.500 --> 01:32.900
nowhere working day and night trying to prevent the blaze from spreading is pretty intense.

01:32.900 --> 01:37.300
Oh honey, I'm glad you're okay but I have some exciting news.

01:39.460 --> 01:46.260
I think I'm pregnant. Really? Wow that's amazing this is great news. I've always

01:46.260 --> 01:49.540
wanted to be a father. We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

01:58.500 --> 02:10.500
We have your test results back and indeed you are pregnant. Let's see here.

02:10.500 --> 02:16.740
Everything seems to be in order. Your approximate due date is October 27th 2009 so that means

02:16.740 --> 02:25.540
the baby was conceived on February 3rd 2009. Are you sure? Are these things accurate?

02:25.700 --> 02:30.820
Well yes sir, they are. What's wrong? Why are you asking these questions?

02:33.860 --> 02:40.020
This baby isn't mine. I was away the first week of February at a training seminar. I, I,

02:41.140 --> 02:43.540
no, it can't be.

02:56.180 --> 03:05.940
All right so more drama in our love story. Oh my God. Things were going well and now more

03:05.940 --> 03:12.420
bad news. Yeah or good news? We're not sure yet. Yeah. Okay let's take a look at the vocabulary

03:12.420 --> 03:21.300
first in language takeaway. Language takeaway. Well we're going to look at four words now. The first

03:21.300 --> 03:30.580
one blaze blaze blaze blaze. So this noun is another word for a fire right? Or a big fire.

03:30.580 --> 03:36.420
Yeah a really big fire. The blaze. So basically it's like the flame of the fire. Yes this one is a

03:36.420 --> 03:41.140
little bit difficult so I think we can use some examples to show us how to use this word.

03:42.180 --> 03:48.980
Example one. The blaze is spreading quickly. We need to evacuate these people.

03:51.860 --> 03:58.500
Example two. We have to go in there and save those people from the blaze.

04:01.300 --> 04:06.660
Okay so it's clear now blaze. Let's look at our next word conceived.

04:06.660 --> 04:11.780
Conceived. The past of conceived. Right conceived.

04:11.780 --> 04:17.380
Conceived is a nice fancy word. Yes and what does it mean Marco? To create. Oh

04:17.460 --> 04:24.740
like how you sidesteped around. So it means to create. You can conceive a baby. Yes. You can

04:24.740 --> 04:31.540
conceive an idea. Yes. So it basically means to create. Yes. Most commonly with the baby. Yeah.

04:31.540 --> 04:38.660
Yeah conceived. So after the baby was conceived. Yep. We have a due date. Yes. We all know that

04:38.660 --> 04:44.980
it's nine months later. Yes. Approximately. Yeah due dates. So the due date is the date of birth

04:45.860 --> 04:51.540
it's the doctor's guess when the birth would be. Would be. Okay. When you go to the doctor and say

04:51.540 --> 04:58.660
when will my baby be born he'll still say, well your due date is blah blah blah. Nine months later. Yeah.

04:58.660 --> 05:05.940
Okay and our last word in language takeaway accurate. Accurate. Accurate. Accurate.

05:05.940 --> 05:14.420
Now the due dates aren't accurate. Right. That means they're not 100% sure or precise. Yes.

05:14.500 --> 05:20.980
So when something is accurate it's absolutely certain. Absolutely precise. Yes. 100%

05:20.980 --> 05:25.220
okay so accurate. Let's listen to some more examples of how we can use accurate.

05:26.900 --> 05:35.140
Example one. A blood test is the most accurate way of finding out if you are pregnant.

05:35.460 --> 05:47.860
Example two. These reports are not accurate. John we checked and discovered a lot of mistakes.

05:52.260 --> 05:59.860
Example three. This new software helps us calculate costs in a very accurate way.

06:00.100 --> 06:06.260
With those examples I think we're ready to listen to this dialogue again. This time we're

06:06.260 --> 06:12.100
going to slow it down. Yeah in case you were so shocked by what happened that you couldn't follow.

06:18.180 --> 06:26.100
Honey, of course I forgive you. I love you so much. I've really missed you.

06:27.060 --> 06:34.980
Please forgive me. I was wrong to get upset over nothing. I'm sorry I haven't called or anything.

06:35.700 --> 06:41.620
But right after you decided you wanted to break, I was called up north to put out some major

06:41.620 --> 06:48.100
forest fires. I was in the middle of nowhere working day and night trying to prevent the

06:48.100 --> 06:54.820
blaze from spreading. It was pretty intense. Oh honey, I'm glad you're okay.

06:55.700 --> 07:07.780
But I have some exciting news. I think I'm pregnant. Really? Wow that's amazing. This is great news.

07:08.580 --> 07:13.780
I've always wanted to be a father. We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

07:14.740 --> 07:20.820
We have your test results back and indeed you are pregnant. Let's see here.

07:21.540 --> 07:27.380
Everything seems to be in order. Your approximate new date is October 27th, 2009.

07:27.380 --> 07:34.580
So that means the baby was conceived on February 3rd, 2009. Are you sure?

07:35.540 --> 07:42.900
Are these things accurate? Well, yes sir, they are. What's wrong? Why are you asking these

07:43.860 --> 07:52.580
questions? This baby isn't mind. I was away the first week of February at a training seminar.

07:52.580 --> 07:56.100
I, I know. It can't be.

07:59.460 --> 08:04.740
Alright so continuing on with our drama. Let's take a look at some interesting phrases

08:04.740 --> 08:12.660
in fluency builder. Fluency builder. Well we've got three phrases for you. The first one is

08:13.780 --> 08:20.980
the middle of nowhere. Middle of nowhere. Middle of nowhere. This is a kind of a funny one.

08:20.980 --> 08:25.780
But I think if we listen to some examples, it will help us to understand the meaning of this phrase.

08:27.380 --> 08:34.820
Example one. We are in the middle of nowhere. How can we find our way back home?

08:37.700 --> 08:38.420
Example two.

08:38.500 --> 08:45.620
I was in the middle of nowhere, so I couldn't even use my mobile phone.

08:48.660 --> 08:55.620
Example three. It takes me two hours to drive to your house.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.980
It's in the middle of nowhere.

09:00.260 --> 09:06.660
Alright so middle of nowhere, it means that you are lost. Yeah you're in a place with no cities

09:06.660 --> 09:13.540
or people or anything nearby. Okay so just imagine yourself in a desert that would be the middle of

09:13.540 --> 09:20.500
nowhere. Yes or in Canada. In Canada. That would be the middle of nowhere. Alright let's take a look at

09:20.500 --> 09:28.420
our next phrase. First thing in the morning. First thing in the morning. First thing in the morning.

09:28.420 --> 09:34.980
So when we talk about the first thing, it means really, really early in the morning. So I can change

09:34.980 --> 09:41.540
it a little bit and say first thing in the afternoon. Early in the afternoon. Or first thing tomorrow morning.

09:41.540 --> 09:48.340
Right. So really early tomorrow. Okay so it's a very common way of referring to very early.

09:49.060 --> 09:53.460
Yeah it's not like first thing in the morning is like six o'clock in the morning. Right. But if you

09:53.460 --> 09:57.940
say okay I'll take care of that first thing in the morning. You'll do it right away in the morning.

09:57.940 --> 10:03.940
Right away. Right when you get to the office. Right. Yeah. Okay. Let's look at our last phrase.

10:05.140 --> 10:12.580
Seems to be in order. Seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order. So everything is

10:12.580 --> 10:19.620
okay. Everything's normal. Everything seems to be normal. Yeah. Everything looks okay. Yes. So this is a

10:19.620 --> 10:27.300
very common phrase when people check your documents or your reports. They'll say okay. All the

10:27.300 --> 10:32.980
papers seem to be in order. Very common. Yes. Good news when you're pregnant that everything seems to

10:33.300 --> 10:38.180
be in order. Exactly. Yeah. Everything is normal. All right. So let's listen to this dramatic dialogue

10:38.180 --> 10:40.980
one more time and we'll come back and talk to you.

10:51.540 --> 10:58.420
Honey, of course I forgive you. I love you so much. I've really missed you. I was wrong to get

10:58.420 --> 11:03.940
upset over nothing. I'm sorry I haven't called anything but right after you decided you

11:03.940 --> 11:08.980
wanted to break. I was up north to put out some major forest fires. I was in the middle of nowhere

11:08.980 --> 11:14.020
working day and night and trying to prevent the blaze from spreading is pretty intense. Oh honey,

11:14.020 --> 11:23.620
I'm glad you're okay but I have some exciting news. I think I'm pregnant. Really? Wow that's

11:23.620 --> 11:29.060
amazing. This is great news. I've always wanted to be a father. We'll go to the doctor first thing in the

11:29.060 --> 11:50.500
morning. We have your test results back and indeed you are pregnant. Let's see here.

11:50.580 --> 11:56.740
Everything seems to be in order. Your approximate new date is October 27th, 2009. So that means

11:56.740 --> 12:05.460
the baby was conceived on February 3rd, 2009. Are you sure? Are these things accurate?

12:05.460 --> 12:10.900
Well yes sir, they are. What's wrong? Why are you asking these questions?

12:13.940 --> 12:18.820
This baby isn't mine. I was away the first week of February at training seven hours. I

12:19.780 --> 12:23.620
I know. It can't be.

12:35.620 --> 12:40.740
Marco, what do you think about this situation? What would you do if you were this guy?

12:40.740 --> 12:46.580
It's complicated. I know. I don't know what I would do. It seems like something a very

12:46.580 --> 12:54.180
typical of soap operas. Well I don't know because she didn't really deny it in the end. She didn't say

12:54.180 --> 13:00.580
no right away. Yeah and but she didn't say like oh. Yeah she didn't really accept it so it's still a

13:00.580 --> 13:06.740
little bit difficult to see if maybe she cheated on him. Yeah something. Hey guys, what do you think?

13:06.740 --> 13:11.620
Do you think Veronica cheated on Stephen? Do you think it's his baby? Maybe it's not. Maybe the

13:11.620 --> 13:16.820
doctor is wrong. Maybe it's the doctor's baby. Maybe it's anything good happen here at English

13:16.820 --> 13:22.500
but so send us your ideas and tell us what do you think happens next? Come to EnglishPod.com

13:22.500 --> 13:28.180
where you can leave your questions your comments. Yeah and Marco and I are always around to

13:28.740 --> 13:34.420
answer your questions, respond to your comments. Exactly and we want to know what you think will happen next.

13:34.420 --> 13:45.940
All right guys so until next time. Bye!
