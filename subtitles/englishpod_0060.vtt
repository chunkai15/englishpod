00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.800
And I'm Erica.

00:07.800 --> 00:12.100
And today we're bringing you our great suspense, scary series.

00:12.100 --> 00:16.100
Our thriller, our thriller, new guy in town, part four.

00:16.100 --> 00:21.200
Alright, well, I don't want to give you any hints about what will happen in this dialogue.

00:21.200 --> 00:28.700
Yes, it's totally unexpected, so let's listen to our dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about some of the great vocabulary.

00:30.500 --> 00:43.000
Alright, drag her over here and help me tie her up.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I can't believe she fell for it.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Well, you got admit, my acting was brilliant.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Whatever, I was the one that convinced her to come.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Look, she's waking up.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
What's going on, Ellen? What are you doing?

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
The cat's out of the bag, you witch! You can stop pretending now.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
Yeah, Louis, we know who you are. Now we want some answers. Why are you here?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
You can't stop me.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Brian!

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
You can't stop me.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Brian!

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
You can't stop me!

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Brian!

01:45.000 --> 01:57.000
I certainly didn't see that one coming.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Everyone thought that our mind was a vampire.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I know!

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Now it turns out that they were acting.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah, that crazy.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Crazy, huh?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Strange things happen here on your spot.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Alright, so why don't we take a look at some of the language that we saw in language takeaway?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Language takeaway.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Well, we have three words for you here that we heard in the dialogue.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
And the first one, our mind tells Ellen to drag her over here.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Right, drag, drag.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
So when you drag something or somebody, you pull them across the floor.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Or pull them across the ground.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Pull them, but you don't actually pick them up, right?

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Oh, yeah, their body is still touching the ground.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Okay, so just imagine if you have a really heavy suitcase, it doesn't have any wheels.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
You got to drag it across the floor.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I've been there.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, it's happened to me too.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
So drag.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Alright, and then he says, tie her up.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Tie her up.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Tie somebody up.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
So to tie somebody up.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
To use rope and put it around a person so that they cannot move.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Right.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
So you take rope, you tie a person up.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And it's always used like this, right?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Tie somebody up.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yes.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Tie him up.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Tie that up.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Tie that up.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Okay.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
And our last word.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I like this one.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Fools.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Fools.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Fools.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So our singular would be full.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
F-O-O.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
So what's a fool?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Well, a fool is a stupid person.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Right.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
A person that doesn't know.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yes.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Something.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Or an ignorant person.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Mm-hmm.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Alright.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, lowest things that are mine.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Ellen, our fools.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Exactly.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Apparently she got really angry and managed to escape from the chair or whatever.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
She was tied up.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Right.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Well, the dialogue was a little bit fast.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
There was a lot of sound effects as well.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yep.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
So let's listen to this dialogue.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Again, we're going to slow it down a little bit.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
And I'm sure it's going to be a little bit easier to understand.

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
Alright, drag her over here and help me tie her up.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I can't believe she fell for it.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, you gotta admit, my acting was brilliant.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Whatever.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
I was the one that convinced her to come.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Look, she's waking up.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
What's going on, Ellen?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
What's you doing?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
The cats out of the bag, you witch.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
You can stop pretending now.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah, lowest.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
We know who you are.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Now, we want some answers.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Why are you here?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Ahahaha.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Fools.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
You don't know who you're dealing with.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
You can't stop me.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Run.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Well, Marco, I noticed in this dialogue,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
there's a lot of words and phrases that we can use to talk about

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
lying or fooling somebody.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Exactly.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
There is a lot of language about lying.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
So let's take a look at it in Fluency Builder.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Fluency Builder.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
Alright, so in Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at four phrases.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
The first one, fell for it.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I can't believe she fell for it.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Fell for it.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Okay, so it's not that she physically fell.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
No, no.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Okay.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
But she believed the lie.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
She believed the lie.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
You fell for the lie.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah, I know that we have some examples,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
so we can understand this phrase,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
fell for it a little bit better.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Example one.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
You might seem like a nice guy, but don't fall for it.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
He's a jerk.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Example two.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
I can't believe I fell for your lies.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Example three.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I told my mom I was going to lie,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
and she fell for it.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Alright, well, that's a lot clearer to me.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I noticed that we have the preposition it here.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, it is at the end.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
And it's referring to the lie.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Yes.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Or the joke.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Or the story.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
She fell for the story, but you wouldn't say she fell for the story.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
You would say she fell for it.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, so these three words always always go together.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Fell for it.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
So don't forget the it.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Don't forget the it.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Okay, let's take a look at our second word.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Gullible.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
So Ellen thinks that low S was gullible.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Right.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
A gullible person.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, gullible.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
A gullible person is somebody that always believes.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
They always fall for it.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
They always fall for it.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
They believe anything you say.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
So I know you were a little bit gullible when you were younger, right?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah, that's true.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
You know what?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
My grandmother used to tell me every year.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
She would say, oh, I'm 35.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I'm 35.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
And I really believed her until I was about 12 years old.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Wow.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
So you were really gullible.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
But you're not anymore.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
No, I know better.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Alright, so gullible.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
A gullible person.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Okay, now let's look at the next phrase.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
The cat's out of the bag.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
The cat is out of the bag.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
The cat is out of the bag.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Okay.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
So again, it's not little.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
It's not like you had a cat in a bag.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
No, you let it out.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Alright.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
A nice idiom here.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Meaning the truth is out.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
The truth is out.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
We discovered the truth.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Yes.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
So imagine that the cat is the truth.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Right.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
And it escaped.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Yes.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Okay.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
So the cat's out of the bag.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
The truth is out.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
We know the truth now.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yep.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Okay.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
And our last phrase.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Pretending.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Pretending.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Pretending.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
So low S was pretending to be a normal housewife.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Mm-hmm.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Let's listen to some examples of how we would use pretending.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Example one.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Pretend that you're my boyfriend and he'll go away.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Example two.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I can't believe Lucy pretended to be sick.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Example three.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
You forgot my birthday.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Don't pretend that everything is okay.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Okay.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
So pretending is acting like you are somebody that you are not.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yes.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Or yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
It's sort of like acting a lie.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Okay.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
So for example, on Halloween, everyone dresses up as a monster or spider man or something.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So everyone pretends to be that character.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yes.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
But they are not.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yes.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Okay.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Pretending.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Okay.

08:56.000 --> 09:10.000
So let's listen to her dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk some more.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
All right.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Drag her over here and help me tie her up.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I can't believe she fell for it.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Well, you got admit.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
My acting was brilliant.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Whatever.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
I was the one that convinced her to come.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Look.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
She's waking up.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
What's going on, Ellen?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
What are you doing?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
The cats out of the bag.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
You wish?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
You can stop pretending now.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Lois.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
We know who you are.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Now we want some answers.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Why are you here?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah her ears.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Close up, please.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Come here and kill her.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
No, you can destroy her.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Sorry.

10:07.000 --> 10:27.480
Okay, so what do you think will happen in Part 5?

10:27.480 --> 10:28.960
I have no idea.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.240
Well, what do you guys think will happen in Part 5?

10:32.240 --> 10:36.160
Apparently, our mind isn't a vampire anymore.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.160
But Lois is a witch.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.160
But Lois is a witch.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.160
Who's Ellen?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.160
What's her next list?

10:40.160 --> 10:42.160
Are we going to see her?

10:42.160 --> 10:43.160
She's an alien.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.160
Oh my god.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.160
We don't know what will happen.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.160
But you can tell us what you think will happen.

10:47.160 --> 10:51.960
