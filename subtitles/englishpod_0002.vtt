00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.300
I'm Amira.

00:07.300 --> 00:13.500
Amira and I are here today with another interesting and useful lesson for you English learners.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.000
Amira, why don't you explain a little bit of what this lesson is about today?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.500
It's about calling in sick.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.500
Oh, okay. That's useful.

00:22.500 --> 00:27.000
Yes, definitely. It happens to everyone once in a while. You don't feel so well.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Or you feel well, but you don't want to go to work.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Right.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
So you call in sick.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Okay, let's listen to this dialogue and I want everyone to keep their ears open

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
and see if the boss believes this person.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Let's listen.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello, Daniel speaking. How may help you?

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Hi, Daniel. Julie here.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi, Julie. How are you?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong?

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
I have a headache, sore throat, a runny nose, and I'm feeling slightly feverish.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
See, so you're calling in sick?

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes, I was hoping to take the day off to recover.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Okay, then. Try and get some rest.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Marco, do you think he believed her?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
No, I don't think he believed her.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
He didn't sound really convinced.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Yes, and Julie didn't sound really sick, huh?

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Exactly. Well, we have some really good vocabulary here.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Amira, why don't you begin with the first one?

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
The first phrase I've chosen for you is a very, very useful one.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm feeling quite ill today.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm feeling quite ill today.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm feeling quite ill today.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
All right, what does this mean exactly?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
It means that she's feeling sick.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Oh, okay, that's clear. So she is sick. She's feeling sick.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Okay, let's look at another really useful phrase.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
And this one is, I'm coming down with the flu.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm coming down with the flu.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm coming down with the flu.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm coming down with the flu.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
All right, and this phrase means that I am starting to get the flu

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
or I am getting the flu.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Okay, the next phrase I have for you is calling in sick.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Calling in sick.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Calling in sick.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Calling in sick.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
It means calling your boss to tell him that you can't come to work today.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
I personally love this phrase because it saves so much time and explanations.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Okay, perfect.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
So if I say this, then everyone will know that I am not coming to work today.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Yes, definitely.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Perfect.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
All right.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
And the last phrase that we're going to take a look at today is

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I was hoping to take the day off.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I was hoping to take the day off.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
I was hoping to take the day off.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I was hoping to take the day off.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Right.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
And she says this to ask for permission because she does not want to go to work.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Okay.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Now, couldn't she just say, like, I can't come today?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Right.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
She could say, I can't come today, but that would be a little bit in polite.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Okay.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
So when she says I was hoping to take the day off,

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
it's a polite way of asking.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
It's a polite way, exactly, because she is talking to her boss.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Very good.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
So let's listen to the dialogue one more time.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
The dialogue is a little different this time.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Listen carefully and see if you think the boss believes her this time.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Hello, Daniel speaking.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
How may I help you?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Hi, Daniel.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Julie here.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Hi, Julie.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
How are you?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
What's wrong?

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
I have a headache, a sore throat, a runny nose,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
and I'm feeling slightly feverish.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
So are you calling in sick?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yes.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I was hoping to take the day off to recover.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Okay, then.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Try and get some rest.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
Okay, guys, we're back.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
And I do think he believed her this time.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah, I think he was understanding when he said,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
okay, then try and get some rest.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, and Julie sounded pretty sick.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Yes, yes, she did.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah, it was convincing.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Well, you know what?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
I almost called in sick last week.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Really?

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah, I wasn't feeling very well, and so I almost didn't come to work.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Oh, that would have been really bad for me.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I would have been stuck here without you, Marco.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, you would have had to do the podcast all by yourself.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Oh, no.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
You know, actually, I had the same symptoms as Julie.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
I also had a headache, and I had a sore throat,

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
and also the worst thing and the thing that I hate the most

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
is I had a runny nose.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
That's really bad, because then you have to blow your nose all the time,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
and then it gets red, and it hurts, right?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Exactly, yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Luckily, I didn't have a fever, though.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Oh, thank God.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
So did you take some medicine, and it just killed everything?

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, I had a friend, and he had some pills for the flu,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
and he just gave me a couple, and I felt better in about two days.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Oh, great.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Well, so guys, let me tell you about a very funny thing

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
that really happens in real life in Egypt.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
What story do you have for us today?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Well, it's actually not a story.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
It's a fact.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I mean, people in Egypt, when they're sick,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
they never call in sick themselves.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
They'll have someone do that for them.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Oh, that's interesting.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Why? Why do they do this?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Well, there's this weird speculation about, you know,

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
if you can make it to the phone, you can make it to the office.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I agree.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
If I were a boss, I would do the same thing.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
All right, listeners, we're out of time today,
