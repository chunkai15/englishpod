Hello English learners, welcome back to English Pod, my name is Marco and I'm

00:06.160 --> 00:10.320
Erica and today we're going to be taking you to the airport. That's right. We're

00:10.320 --> 00:17.160
going to listen as a man checks in at the airport and deals with his luggage. That's

00:17.160 --> 00:20.520
right. So we're going to be looking at a lot of great stuff that can help you the next

00:20.520 --> 00:26.520
time you are at the airport at the checking counter. So why don't we take a look at one word

00:26.520 --> 00:32.600
that we're going to preview today in vocabulary preview? Very calorie preview. We're

00:32.600 --> 00:37.480
going to hear this guy say I'd like to check three pieces. He's going to check three

00:37.480 --> 00:44.760
pieces of what? Pieces of luggage. So when we talk about luggage we can say pieces of

00:44.760 --> 00:50.840
luggage. That's right. luggage is a non-count noun. So you can't say one luggage to

00:50.840 --> 00:58.200
luggage is three legages. That's wrong. Right. So we use pieces of luggage. Okay. So three pieces

00:58.200 --> 01:03.160
of luggage. Very good. Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time. We're going to see

01:03.160 --> 01:08.200
what happens with this guy at the airport and with his pieces of luggage.

01:08.680 --> 01:24.040
Next please. Hello sir. May I see your passport please? Yes. Here you go. Will you be checking

01:24.040 --> 01:29.880
any bags today? Yes. I'd like to check three pieces. I'm sorry sir. Airline policy only

01:29.880 --> 01:36.200
allows two pieces of check luggage at 20 kilograms each plus one piece of carry on luggage.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.840
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase. What? Why? I'm taking an inner

01:40.840 --> 01:47.320
kind of no flight. I'm flying 16,000 kilometers. How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags

01:47.320 --> 01:53.000
that's absurd? I'm sorry sir. There's nothing I can do. You cannot board the flight with that

01:53.000 --> 01:58.600
large bag either. Carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat. That bag

01:58.600 --> 02:03.880
is clearly too big. Now I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.840
When it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm in a leg. So tell me miss

02:09.240 --> 02:16.680
how much will I have to pay for all of this? Let's see. 625 US dollars. That's more than my

02:16.680 --> 02:29.480
round trip ticket. All right well that's a whole lot of money isn't it? Well I think it's a very

02:29.480 --> 02:35.720
common situation. I'm sure many of our listeners can relate to this situation. Overweight charges

02:35.720 --> 02:41.000
are pretty expensive. Very high. I know from personal experience but that's not what we want to talk

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
about. Now we want to talk about some really useful vocabulary in language takeaway. Language takeaway.

02:50.600 --> 02:55.640
All right on language takeaway today we have five words. So why don't we start with the first one?

02:55.720 --> 03:02.440
So the woman asked, will you be checking any bags today? Will you be checking any bags today?

03:02.440 --> 03:11.320
Two check bags. Right so the verb to check. It means to to give your bags to the airline

03:11.320 --> 03:16.920
to register them. Okay so that's what happens with your luggage. You check them so basically they

03:16.920 --> 03:23.640
become responsible for your bags. Right it reminds me of checking into a hotel. Right very similar

03:23.720 --> 03:29.960
when you go to a hotel you register at the hotel you check in. In this case you just check your

03:29.960 --> 03:35.640
luggage. You don't check in your luggage. Right okay so check luggage. So you wanted to check three

03:35.640 --> 03:44.440
pieces of luggage and he also had carry on luggage. Carry on luggage. Carry on. So carry on luggage

03:44.440 --> 03:50.200
it's pretty simple. That's right you carry it on yourself. Exactly you carry it on to the plane.

03:50.280 --> 03:57.160
Now we can we can talk about carry on luggage right or carry on bag. Right or carry on suit

03:57.160 --> 04:03.400
case. Very small suit case that can fit on your seat. Exactly. All right so carry on luggage.

04:03.400 --> 04:11.320
Now he was traveling on an intercontinental flight. Intercontinental. Intercontinental.

04:11.320 --> 04:17.320
We have two words there. Inter between between right and continental. So this sounds like

04:17.320 --> 04:26.360
continent. Okay so he's traveling maybe from Asia to North America. Okay intercontinental.

04:26.360 --> 04:33.960
He's trying to board this intercontinental flight. So to board a flight board a plane.

04:33.960 --> 04:40.040
Board a train. All right so basically it means to to get on to get on to get on to get on a vehicle.

04:40.040 --> 04:47.880
Okay so I can say board the ship. Board the car. No. No. But board the train.

04:47.880 --> 04:53.720
Board the train. Board the bus. All aboard. That's right that's why in movies you see that

04:53.720 --> 05:00.200
somebody will yell all aboard. Yeah and the train station right. Exactly. All aboard. Okay so

05:00.200 --> 05:07.240
board a vehicle and our last phrase for today. Overhead compartment. Overhead compartment.

05:07.720 --> 05:15.880
Overhead compartment. All right let's break this phrase down overhead. So that's on top of your

05:15.880 --> 05:22.760
head right exactly. Yeah above you. Yeah and the compartment is a place where you can put something

05:22.760 --> 05:28.360
and store it. Mm-hmm. Kind of like a box. Right. Yeah so you have an overhead compartment that

05:28.360 --> 05:33.800
big box where you put your bags and your purse or whatever on an airplane. Mm-hmm. Very similar

05:33.880 --> 05:39.320
to for example an overhead projector. Right so that's the machine that puts an image or a

05:39.320 --> 05:44.520
picture on a wall like sometimes you see them in meetings. Right so because the image is over your head

05:44.520 --> 05:50.360
in a big it's called an overhead projector. Okay so some great language why don't we hear again

05:50.360 --> 05:53.240
in context by listening to the dialogue for the second time.

05:53.240 --> 06:09.720
Next please. Hello sir. May I see your passport please? Yes here you go. Will you be checking any

06:09.720 --> 06:18.520
bags today? Yes I'd like to check if three pieces. I'm sorry sir. Airline policy allows only

06:18.520 --> 06:26.120
two pieces of checked luggage at 20 kilograms each plus one piece of carry on luggage. I will

06:26.120 --> 06:34.440
have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase. What? Why? I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

06:35.000 --> 06:43.000
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers. How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags? That's absurd.

06:43.160 --> 06:49.720
I'm sorry sir. There's nothing I can do. You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

06:50.440 --> 06:57.800
Carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big.

06:58.520 --> 07:06.280
Now I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket but when it comes to charging

07:06.280 --> 07:14.040
for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg. Tell me miss how much will I have to pay

07:14.040 --> 07:23.240
for all this? Let's see. 625 euros dollars. No that's more than my round trip ticket.

07:27.960 --> 07:33.240
All right so I think it's a little bit more clear now and with this it's time for us to take a look at

07:33.240 --> 07:43.160
some great phrases in putting it together. But you get together. So this guy was pretty angry about

07:43.160 --> 07:51.880
this airline policy and he said, how am I supposed to? How am I supposed to? How am I supposed to?

07:52.440 --> 07:57.720
Okay so before we get into explaining this why don't we listen to a couple of examples so we can

07:57.720 --> 08:06.600
try and understand what it means? Example one. How am I supposed to fit the dog in the car?

08:06.600 --> 08:15.480
There are 10 people in there already. Example two. How is she supposed to get to work if

08:15.800 --> 08:25.240
a car's in the shop? Example three. How are we supposed to know the answer to that?

08:25.240 --> 08:32.840
It's impossible. Okay so I can understand that it means how can I do this?

08:32.840 --> 08:38.040
Right how do you expect me to do this? How is it possible for me to do this? Very good.

08:38.040 --> 08:42.120
It's a phrase you use when you're frustrated right? Yeah exactly you're maybe a little bit

08:42.200 --> 08:47.160
frustrated or you're maybe nervous of something that you can't do or don't know how.

08:47.160 --> 08:52.840
Yeah this phrase it's not impolite but it sort of gives the idea that you're challenging the

08:52.840 --> 08:58.840
other person a little bit. Maybe yeah okay so a good phrase that you can use on different situations

08:58.840 --> 09:04.280
and you can try and mix it up with different verbs right? Right. All right now let's take a look at

09:04.280 --> 09:10.680
our next phrase. I'm sorry sir there's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can do.

09:10.760 --> 09:15.720
There's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can do. So basically the woman can't help the

09:15.720 --> 09:21.560
man even though he's insisting and he's pushing that he wants another solution. Yeah right.

09:21.560 --> 09:27.720
So finally she says I'm sorry there's nothing I can do. So we use this phrase

09:28.440 --> 09:33.560
when someone's pushing you too much right? Right and you would use it only in that situation

09:33.560 --> 09:38.280
where it's in because it is a little bit it's it's strong. It's not impolite but it's just

09:38.280 --> 09:43.000
you're saying you know what I'm sorry there's I can't do anything about it. Now let's move on to

09:43.000 --> 09:51.480
our third phrase. You charge next to nothing. Next to nothing. Next to nothing. Next to nothing.

09:52.040 --> 09:56.760
All right so we're talking about charging we're talking about money. Why don't we listen to some

09:56.760 --> 10:07.240
examples of what this next to nothing phrase means? Example one. Do you like my new house?

10:07.240 --> 10:13.560
It was so cheap that it almost costs next to nothing. Example two.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.040
Let's go to Thailand. Take its costs next to nothing right now.

10:23.880 --> 10:32.120
Example three. The real estate agent charge me next to nothing for his commission so I got a really good deal.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.320
So when something costs next to nothing it's really cheap. Right.

10:37.320 --> 10:42.840
Really cheap or you consider it to be cheap. And now for our last phrase it's the complete

10:42.840 --> 10:48.920
opposite of next to nothing. Right. Charge an arm in a leg. An arm and a leg.

10:48.920 --> 10:55.080
An arm and a leg. All right so this means it's really expensive. It's so expensive it's like

10:55.080 --> 11:01.880
giving your arm and your leg. Right to pay for it. Yeah. Very good so next to nothing really cheap

11:01.880 --> 11:07.800
an arm and a leg really expensive. Can we look at the use here? All right so when the dialogue we

11:07.800 --> 11:14.200
heard you charge an arm and a leg but we can also say it costs an arm and a leg. Right because

11:14.200 --> 11:19.400
we are referring to money. Right. All right so some great phrases here. Now I think it's time

11:19.400 --> 11:34.360
we listen to our dialogue one more time. Next please. Hello sir may I see your passport please.

11:34.360 --> 11:40.040
Yes. Here you go. Will you be checking any bags today? Yes I'd like to check three pieces.

11:40.840 --> 11:47.720
I'm sorry sir. Airline policy only allows two pieces of check luggage at 20 kilograms each plus one

11:47.720 --> 11:53.400
piece of carry on luggage. I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase. What? Why?

11:53.400 --> 11:58.760
I'm taking an intercontinental flight. I'm flying 16,000 kilometers. How am I supposed to take only

11:58.760 --> 12:05.880
two 20 kilo bags that's absurd? I'm sorry sir there's nothing I can do. You cannot board the flight

12:05.880 --> 12:10.840
with that large bag either carry on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

12:11.480 --> 12:17.240
That bag is clearly too big. Now I see you charge next to nothing for an international ticket

12:17.320 --> 12:22.120
when it comes to charging for any other small thing you charge an arm and a leg. So tell me miss

12:22.680 --> 12:30.360
how much will I have to pay for all of this? Let's see. 625 US dollar. That's more than my round

12:30.360 --> 12:38.360
trip ticket. Okay so airline policies luggage it's always a problem right? Most of the time you

12:38.360 --> 12:44.600
always end up paying overweight when you travel. Yeah I know that this happened to me once and it

12:44.600 --> 12:51.080
was really expensive. Really what happened? I was flying on an intercontinental flight from from India

12:51.080 --> 12:57.880
back to Europe and I had too many extra bags but I really needed to bring them and so it cost me

12:57.880 --> 13:08.200
$6,000. So my credit card was pretty maxed out after that. That's incredible. Well I'm sure many

13:08.200 --> 13:13.960
