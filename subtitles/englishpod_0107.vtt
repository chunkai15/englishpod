Hello, English learners. Welcome back to another great podcast here at EnglishPod.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.440
My name is Marco. And I'm Erica. And today we're going to be talking about one of our favorite

00:11.440 --> 00:17.120
topics as always. Food. Food. We're going to be at a restaurant. And you know, one of the most

00:17.120 --> 00:23.040
difficult or embarrassing things to deal with at a restaurant is what to say when you don't like

00:23.040 --> 00:28.080
the food or when it's bad quality food. Right. So maybe we have to complain about the food

00:28.160 --> 00:32.720
or maybe even the service. Right. That's right. And in this lesson, we're going to be learning

00:32.720 --> 00:38.400
some some really wonderful words and phrases that you can use when you need to complain about the

00:38.400 --> 00:44.320
food or the service in a restaurant. Okay. So before we listen to what happens in this restaurant with

00:44.320 --> 00:51.600
this food, let's take a look very quickly at vocabulary preview. Very vocabulary preview. Okay.

00:51.600 --> 00:57.760
We're only going to do one word today. And this you'll hear in the dialogue and establishment

00:58.240 --> 01:04.560
establishment. This kind of establishment. Okay. So when I say an establishment, that's a noun,

01:05.280 --> 01:11.200
what is an establishment? It's basically a fancy word for a business or a restaurant in this case.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.920
In this case, it's a restaurant. Yeah. But in general, you can say it's a business. So you have a very

01:15.920 --> 01:22.640
fine establishment. That's right. So an establishment, a type of business, a place of business really.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.360
Very good. All right. So now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue. We're going to

01:27.360 --> 01:33.120
find out what's going on here. Apparently, there is a very angry customer and we're going to find out why.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.040
Excuse me. Waiter. Yes, sir. What can I do for you? I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes

01:45.040 --> 01:49.200
and no one has offered me a glass of water brought any bread to the table and our appetizer

01:49.200 --> 01:53.680
having been served yet. You know, in this kind of establishment, I'd expect much better service. I'm

01:53.760 --> 01:59.040
sorry, sir. I'll check on your order right away. For a lags honey, the place is busy tonight

01:59.040 --> 02:04.400
and I've heard the food is amazing. Anyway, here you are, sir. The fog off of the lady in a mushroom

02:04.400 --> 02:12.960
soup for you. Waiter. I heard a cream of mushroom soup with a spare guess. The soup is obviously

02:12.960 --> 02:18.400
too runny and it's over season. It's completely inedible. Okay. I do apologize for that. Can I bring

02:18.400 --> 02:22.080
you another soup? Or would you like to order something else? Take this fuck up back as well.

02:22.080 --> 02:26.560
It's rubbery and completely overcooked and look at the portion size. How can you charge 25

02:26.560 --> 02:33.600
dollars for a sliver of duck liver? Right away, sir. Honey, come on. The fog off was fine. Why are

02:33.600 --> 02:39.040
you making such a big deal? Are you trying to get our milk pumped again? What do you mean?

02:39.040 --> 02:43.840
You're paying for this and I'm showing out my hard earned bucks. I expect value for money.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.520
Here you are, sir. I hope it is all right now. The chef has prepared it especially for you. Yes, fine.

02:53.040 --> 02:57.360
Honey, are you all right?

03:16.080 --> 03:19.680
Well, I guess that's one lesson. Hey, if you're in a restaurant,

03:19.680 --> 03:23.680
don't be too rude to the waiter. You never know what's going to happen. The waiter and the cook.

03:24.720 --> 03:31.920
You don't want to offend that kitchen staff. All right. So we'll talk about that a little bit later on,

03:31.920 --> 03:39.040
but now I think we had some really interesting vocabulary of how to describe food that is not well

03:39.040 --> 03:46.080
prepared and we can take a look at that now in language takeaway. Language takeaway.

03:47.040 --> 03:52.640
All right, so the guy in this in this dialogue, he ordered a mushroom soup and he complained that the mushroom

03:52.640 --> 04:01.360
suit was too runny. Okay, the soup is too runny. Runny. So he wanted a cream of mushroom. So it should be a little bit thicker.

04:01.360 --> 04:06.080
Yep. But in this case, it was runny. So when something is runny, it's too liquid.

04:06.080 --> 04:13.920
Too liquid. And I think we can relate it to a runny nose, right? Exactly. Okay, so when liquid is coming out of your nose, a runny nose,

04:14.000 --> 04:19.600
in this case, the soup is runny. All right. And another thing that he was complaining about, the food was

04:19.600 --> 04:27.440
over seasoned. Over seasoned. The food is over seasoned. Okay, so if the food is over seasoned,

04:27.440 --> 04:33.920
it's too salty. So it's another way of saying it's too salty. Yeah, it's kind of a fancy cooking term.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.800
Now, can I say if there's too much pepper in the food, can I say it's over seasoned? Well,

04:39.280 --> 04:44.400
technically, no, when a cook says something is over seasoned, he's talking salt only.

04:44.400 --> 04:50.480
Only salt. Okay. So the cream of mushroom is very runny. It's over seasoned. And he said it's

04:50.480 --> 04:59.200
completely inedible. Inedible. It's inedible. Inedible. Now, this word edible. You can eat it.

04:59.200 --> 05:05.440
You can eat it. So we have this prefix inedible. You cannot eat it. This is not possible. Yeah.

05:05.520 --> 05:10.320
And it doesn't mean that physically you can't eat it. It just means it's pretty disgusting. Okay,

05:10.320 --> 05:16.880
this food is inedible. And then he started to complain about the other dish. And he said that

05:16.880 --> 05:24.880
it's rubbery. rubbery. The the foreground was rubbery. All right. So I think we noticed the word rubber.

05:26.240 --> 05:32.720
So obviously, if a food is rubbery, it tastes or it, it's too chewy. It's like chewing on the

05:32.720 --> 05:39.120
bottom of your shoe, right? Okay. So it's it's too hard to chew or to swallow. Exactly. All right.

05:39.120 --> 05:46.000
Apparently, the food was rubbery because it's completely overcooked. Overcooked. All right. We have

05:46.000 --> 05:52.400
overcooked. So when something is overcooked, I mean, it's easy to understand that it's cooked too much.

05:52.400 --> 05:57.280
But it doesn't mean that it's burnt, right? No. So maybe you've ordered your steak to be

05:57.280 --> 06:03.760
rare, but it comes to you well done. So it's not burnt, but it's cooked too much. So also I guess we

06:03.760 --> 06:10.160
can say like chicken. Sometimes if you overcooked chicken, it comes out too dry. Yep. All right. So to overcook

06:10.160 --> 06:17.200
something. Mm-hmm. And finally he was complaining about the size of the dish. And he said,

06:17.840 --> 06:26.400
this is a sliver of duck liver. Okay. A sliver. A sliver. All right. Now this word sliver is like a slice,

06:26.960 --> 06:34.720
a very small tiny little slice. Okay. So we can say, okay. I just want a sliver of bacon for breakfast.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.920
All right. Why don't we hear a few more examples of how we can use sliver?

06:38.800 --> 06:46.560
Example one. No. John's on a diet. He'll just have a sliver of cake and no ice cream.

06:48.800 --> 06:55.520
Example two. I'm really full, but it looks so delicious. Can you just cut me a sliver?

06:57.280 --> 07:04.240
Example three. You called this sliver of beef on my plate of meal. There's almost nothing here.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.040
And those are all the words we had for language takeaway. Now you have, so we've given you different

07:11.040 --> 07:17.040
adjectives of describing food that is not well prepared. So now let's move on to some other phrases

07:17.040 --> 07:24.640
that the customer used to complain in fluency builder. Fluency builder. Okay. So before we get to the

07:24.640 --> 07:31.120
customer complaining language, I want to look at a phrase that the waiter used to apologize.

07:31.120 --> 07:38.720
He said I do apologize. I do apologize. I do apologize. Now why is this phrase so interesting?

07:38.720 --> 07:43.200
Well, I mean, it's pretty easy to understand the meaning, but I want to look at why he added

07:43.200 --> 07:51.840
this verb do. Well, he added the verb do it to this phrase to make it seem a little bit stronger,

07:51.920 --> 07:57.600
to give it a little more power to his apology. Right. So if you have an affirmative phrase like

07:57.600 --> 08:05.280
I apologize, it's good. But if you want to give it a little bit more emphasis, you can say I do apologize.

08:05.280 --> 08:11.040
Why don't we give an example? So I might say this. Marco, I didn't know we had a party tonight.

08:11.600 --> 08:17.520
And I might say what? I did tell you about it last week. Right. So you're just giving a little bit

08:17.520 --> 08:23.600
more power to the statement that you told me. Mm-hmm. So this do did does

08:23.600 --> 08:29.120
becomes an auxiliary to make it more powerful to give it more emphasis. Yeah, exactly. So

08:29.120 --> 08:34.000
I need little phrase. Something you can use if you want to make your apologies sound

08:34.000 --> 08:40.400
maybe a little bit stronger. All right. Now moving on to the next phrase. He was complaining about

08:40.400 --> 08:46.480
the food and it was terrible. And he said, I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks. Okay. Let's

08:46.560 --> 08:52.800
break this one down into two sections. We'll start with shelling out. All right. So to shell out.

08:52.800 --> 08:58.320
So when you shell out, you pay for something. All right. But this gives you the sensation that you are

08:58.960 --> 09:04.480
that you don't really want to pay. You're a bit unhappy about it. Right. So you want to shell out your

09:04.480 --> 09:10.320
money. Mm-hmm. Why don't we listen to some examples to show us how we can use this phrase to shell out.

09:11.280 --> 09:18.800
Example one. Great. It's my girlfriend's birthday this month. So I'm going to have to shell out for a present.

09:20.400 --> 09:27.440
Example two. I really want those shoes, but I can't really afford to shell out $400.

09:29.440 --> 09:37.600
Example three. I can't believe it. Ella showed out the 800 bucks for the tickets. I thought I would have to pay.

09:38.160 --> 09:44.160
All right. So now that we understand shell out, let's move on to the second part of that sentence,

09:44.160 --> 09:51.680
my hard-earned bucks. Hard-earned bucks. My hard-earned bucks. Okay. So bucks are dollars, right?

09:51.680 --> 09:58.960
Dollars. Only dollars, right? Yep. Not not pounds, not your rose. But his hard-earned bucks is

09:58.960 --> 10:03.760
money. He had to work really hard for it. Mm-hmm. So I can also say my hard-earned money,

10:04.400 --> 10:11.840
right? Or my hard-earned cash. Exactly. Very good. So you worked hard to get it. All right. So three,

10:11.840 --> 10:16.800
three great phrases that can be used when you're complaining in a restaurant. And why don't we hear

10:16.800 --> 10:29.600
them one last time in context by listening to the dialogue? Excuse me, waiter. Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

10:29.680 --> 10:33.200
I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes and no one has offered me a glass of water,

10:33.200 --> 10:37.360
brought any bread to the table, and our appetizer haven't been served yet. You know, in this kind

10:37.360 --> 10:42.400
of establishment, I'd expect much better service. I'm sorry, sir. I'll check on your order right away.

10:42.400 --> 10:48.000
Relax, honey. The place is busy tonight, and I've heard the food is amazing. Anyway,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.120
here you are, sir. The fog off of the lady and a mushroom soup for you.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.360
Waiter, I had a cream of mushroom soup with a spare guess. The soup is obviously too

10:59.360 --> 11:04.640
runny, and it's over season. It's completely inedible. Okay, I do apologize for that. Can I bring

11:04.640 --> 11:08.240
you another soup, or would you like to order something else? Take this fuck right back as well.

11:08.240 --> 11:13.280
It's rubbery and completely overcooked. And look at the portion size. How can you charge $25 for a

11:13.600 --> 11:20.160
sliver of duck liver? Right away, sir. Honey, come on, the fog off was fine. Why are you making

11:20.160 --> 11:26.240
such a big deal? Are you trying to get our meal pumped again? But you mean, you're paying for this,

11:26.240 --> 11:32.240
and I'm showing out my hard earned bucks. I expect value for money. Here you are, sir. I hope

11:32.240 --> 11:36.880
it is all right now. The chef has prepared it, especially for you. Yes, fine.

11:36.880 --> 11:43.520
Honey, are you all right?

11:43.520 --> 12:13.200
Yeah, of course, if the foods bad, of course, you're going to send it back. But maybe another

12:13.200 --> 12:18.480
culture, I think people would be a little bit more reluctant to do something like this. Yeah,

12:18.480 --> 12:22.320
but hey, you know, it's an interesting thing about the way Americans eat in restaurants.

12:22.320 --> 12:26.880
So sometimes at the end of the meal, they haven't finished everything. They might ask for a

12:26.880 --> 12:33.200
doggy bag. A doggy bag, yeah. So what is that a doggy bag? Well, usually if you order a big meal,

12:33.200 --> 12:38.240
or you know, half your steak is left over on your plate, you would ask for a doggy bag, and

12:38.240 --> 12:43.360
they would bring you a little box or a bag, and you would take it to supposedly give it to your dog.

12:43.360 --> 12:48.240
Right. So it's sort of like, you like you tell the waiter, oh, you know, the steak was so good.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.920
I couldn't finish it. Can I take some home to my dog? Right. So you would just ask,

12:51.920 --> 12:57.760
where can I have a doggy bag? Right. But it's sort of like code for I'm going to eat this tomorrow

12:57.760 --> 13:02.240
for lunch. Exactly. Because people wouldn't really give it to their dog. Yeah. You know,

13:02.240 --> 13:07.600
that steak wrapped up in a fancy sort of foil so on is going to be a pretty delicious

13:07.680 --> 13:12.400
the next day. Right. Yeah. It's actually very common in the US, but in other countries,

13:12.400 --> 13:17.680
people will leave. Yeah. Entire plates of food. Like they totally impolite to ask the waiter

13:17.680 --> 13:22.160
to pack up the food for you. Exactly. Yep. So a little bit of cultural differences, but we want to

13:22.160 --> 13:27.120
know what you think and how things are done, maybe in your country with complaining or sending

13:27.120 --> 13:32.640
food back or even this whole doggy bag situation. That's right. Why don't you visit our website,

13:32.640 --> 13:37.280
EnglishPod.com and tell us about it. All right. We'll be there to answer any questions or

13:37.280 --> 13:49.280
comments, but we got to go now. So until then. Goodbye. Bye.
