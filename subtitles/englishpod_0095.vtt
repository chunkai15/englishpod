00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello English learners, welcome back to English pod. My name is Marco.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.000
And I'm Erica.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
And today we have a very special lesson because we're going to be focusing a little bit more on grammar.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
That's right.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
We're going to look today at the difference between past simple and past progressive or sometimes called past continuous.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Exactly. So we are going to take a look at these two structures, which are a little bit confusing at times.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
And we're going to be practicing today. But before we get started, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
The vocabulary preview.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Well, this dialogue is all about telling a story in the past.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
And we're going to hear two words in the dialogue that we need to understand the meaning of.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
So the first one, ages.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I haven't seen you in ages.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Okay. So if I tell you, I haven't seen you in ages.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Basically, you haven't seen me in a really long time.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Okay. So it's a way of exaggerating a little bit.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Yes.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
And this word ages. We can use in many different ways.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Like, I've been studying English for ages.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Or, for example, I can say, I haven't been to the dentist in ages.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh, well, guess you better go.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Right. So ages a very long time.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Yes. Now another phrase to run into somebody.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
So to run into somebody.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I ran into Matt.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
Okay. So if you ran into Matt the other day, you met him unexpectedly.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay. So you didn't plan to meet. You didn't have a date,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
right, just casually on the street.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Met exactly.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Okay. So I ran into your friend at the other day.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Okay. So two good words.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
We're going to hear both of these in the dialogue.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
So why don't we get started with dialogue first time?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Mike, what's going on, man?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Long time no see. Hey, Pat.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah. I haven't seen you in ages. How's it going?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Things are going great.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It's funny running into you like this.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Small world, huh?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
You know, just last week I ran into Matt as well.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah? How's he doing?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
He's doing well.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
We went up for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Talking about work and family and all of a sudden,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Matt saw a mouse running into chair and he completely lost it.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Start freaking out and screaming.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Really?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah. And the funniest thing was,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
then he jumped onto his chair and started shrieking like a girl.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
He should have been there and he was staring and laughing.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
It was hilarious.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Ha ha.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
All right. Very good. So a funny story.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
And as we saw a lot of stuff in the past, right?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
That's right. And we're going to look at that in a moment.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
But first, we've got lots of exciting language to describe

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
when somebody gets really emotional.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Okay.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
So when are we starting now with language takeaway?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
We have four words here. Now in the dialogue,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
the guy in the story lost it.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
So he saw a mouse and he completely lost it.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
To lose it.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Okay. So when you lose something, you lose it.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
What are you losing?

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
You're losing control of yourself and your emotion.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay. So you lose your temper maybe.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yep.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
So when I lose it, do I just get angry?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Angry or upset or even sad.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
But it's usually a negative feeling.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Okay. So it's not a good thing to lose it.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
No. So for example, when I showed my boss the sales figures,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
he completely lost it.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Okay. Very good.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
So that's what lose it means.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And now our second word is very similar,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
but has a little bit of a difference.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
That's right.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
He started freaking out.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Okay.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
So to freak out.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
To freak out.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Now freak out is very similar to lose it, right?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Yep.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
But why don't we hear an example now of somebody freaking out?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's just,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
No.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
No. Okay.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Forget it. Forget it.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
All right. Just forget it.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I don't even want to.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I just want to forget it.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I just want to forget it.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I don't know.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I don't know.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Okay. Come down.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Woo.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Come down.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I got to come down.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm so happy I get.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I can't even express it.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm like, I haven't.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Have I even finished one sentence?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm like.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Woo.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Give me a high five.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Maybe.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
All right.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So we heard this person freaking out.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
And basically,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
it could be losing control or losing your temper,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
but also in a positive way.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Right.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
So maybe you're really excited about something

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
that's going to happen.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
So you're freaking out.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Okay.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Maybe you're very nervous.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Or you're very excited.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Mm-hmm.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
All right.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
And now moving on to our third word,

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
stare.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
To stare.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
People started to stare.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Staring.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Now, when you stare at someone or at something,

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
you look at and focus at something for a really long time.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Okay. So you are looking at it.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yep.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
I'm focusing on it.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
All right.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Maybe when we were small,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
our parents taught us that it's not nice

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
to stare at other people.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Exactly.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
All right.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
So to stare.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
In our final words,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
when Matt saw the mouse,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
he started shrieking.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
All right.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
So to shriek.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Shriek.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Very similar to that movie,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Shrek.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Oh, yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Sounds quite similar.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
All right.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
But it's different.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
What does shriek mean?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Well, why don't we listen to an example?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Woo!

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh my god.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Woo!

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Okay. So I think shrieking

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
is to shout in a very high pitched voice.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Exactly.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
That's too shriek.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Okay.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
So we saw four really great words in language takeaway

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
and why don't we listen now to the dialogue

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
for a second time a little bit slower

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
and then we'll come back and look at

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
the differences between simple past and past progressive.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
What's going on, man?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Long time no see.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Hey, Pat.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I haven't seen you in ages.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
How's it going?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Things are going great.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
It's funny running into you like this.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Small world, eh?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
You know, just last week,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I ran into Matt as well.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
How's he doing?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
He's doing well.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
We went out for a couple of beers

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
and the funniest thing happened.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Well, yeah.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, we were talking and catching up

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
on what we've been doing.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Talking about work and family.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
When all of a sudden,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Matt saw a mouse run under his chair

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
and he completely lost it.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
He started freaking out and screaming.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Really?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
And the funniest thing was

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
that he jumped on his chair

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
and started shrieking like a girl.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
You should have been there.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Everyone was staring and laughing.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
It was hilarious.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Ha ha.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Okay, so there was a lot of different uses

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
of past tense here in this dialogue.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Wasn't there?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Yes, since he was telling a story that happened,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
he used the past a lot.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Well, let's now, as promised,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
look at past simple and past progressive

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
in grammar breakdown.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Raman breakdown.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay, Marco.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Before we start our discussion,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
why don't we hear one example of past simple

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
and one example of past progressive?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
You know, just last week,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I ran into Matt as well.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Well, we were talking and catching up

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
on what we've been doing.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Okay, so we heard that just last week

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I ran into Matt,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
so we discussed what run into means.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Yep, to meet someone by surprise.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
All right.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
And now, this structure is the simple past, right?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yep.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Now, the second example that we heard

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
was we were talking and catching up.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Okay, so let's look at the difference in meaning here.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I ran into Matt, happened in the past, right?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Right, simple past.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
But one moment in the past.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
So the action finished, concluded.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Started and finished all around the same time.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
So it's one simple moment.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Okay.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Now, the other example is in the past progressive.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
So the action was happening for a longer period of time.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yep.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Okay, so let's attach some times to this.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
Maybe you ran into Matt at 804.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Okay, and so the action started at 804.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
But you were talking and catching up from 805

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
until 905.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Okay, so you were talking for an hour.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Right.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
So the past progressive you use when the action is happening

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
for a longer period of time.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Okay, so it's a better understand this.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Let's have another example.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Matt saw a mouse when under his chair.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And he could clearly lost it.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Everyone was staring and laughing.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
So as we heard in the example, he saw a mouse run under his chair.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
So a quick action that started and finished quickly.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay, he saw the mouse and it ran under the chair.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yep.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
Now the second example we heard was everyone was staring and laughing.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
So maybe this happened over four or five minutes.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
Okay, so people were looking at him and laughing and talking about how he was screaming like a girl.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yes.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
Okay, so that's the main difference between the simple past and the past progressive.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
The amount of time that the action happened.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yep.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Alright, well now that we understand a little bit more about the past tense.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
Why don't we hear it again in context by listening to the dialogue for a third time?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Mike, what's going on, man?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Long time no see.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Hey, Pat.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
How's it going?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Things are going great.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's funny running into you like this.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Small world, eh?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
You know, just let's weak around to Matt as well.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
How's he doing?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
He's doing well.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
We let up for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Oh, yeah.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
Talking about work and family and all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse running into the chair and he completely lost it.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Start freaking out and screaming.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Really?

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah, and the funniest thing was, then he jumped onto his chair and started shrieking like a girl.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
You should have been there.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Anyone was staring and laughing?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It was hilarious.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Okay, perfect.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
So now that we understand the words and the grammar behind it, there are some interesting phrases here that you can use casually with your friends.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, there's actually a lot of great sort of meeting and greeting and saying hello language.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Mm-hmm.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
So for example, when they met up, since they were old friends, he said, hey, Pat.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Hey.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Okay.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
So this word, hey.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
It's kind of like high.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
It's high, right?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Normally, you would use it to get somebody's attention, right?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Like, hey, I'm over here.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Hey, waiters.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Okay.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But in this case, like, hey, how's it going or hi?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah, so it's a really friendly and informal way of saying hi.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Okay.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
And then he asked, how's it going?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
How's it going?

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
So again, this is a way of saying, how are you?

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah, Marco, what's the correct answer to this greeting?

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Well, well, for example, he said things are going great, right?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
You can say, yeah, things are great or I'm doing well.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Or even great.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Great.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
So how's it going?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Oh, it's great.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Right?

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Now, another one that we didn't see in the dialogue, but it's very popular is when somebody asks,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Hey, what's up?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah, what's up?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
So again, what is the right way to answer this question?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
All right.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
So when somebody says, what's up?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
You can say, well, not much.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Or if maybe you have news or something that you want to share, you would say, well, I just

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
got back from the doctor's office, right?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
But you wouldn't say, fine, thank you.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
Or you wouldn't say very good or any of these other common answers to what's up.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
That's right.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
It can be a little bit tricky.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
So the rule is the normal thing to say when someone says, hey, what's up is nothing much.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Not much.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yep.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
So interesting ways of greeting casually with people, right?

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
You wouldn't use this for it with your boss, maybe you're in an office setting.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Yep.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
More, more useful with your friends.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Okay.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.760

13:05.760 --> 13:09.000
