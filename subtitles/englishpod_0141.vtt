Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.300
And my name is Katherine, and today we've got a very, very useful lesson for all of you out there.

00:12.300 --> 00:17.800
That's right, we're bringing you part two of the What If series, which is a small series.

00:17.800 --> 00:25.300
Small, and it is kind of grammar focused, but it's very, very important because you often want to talk about things that don't happen.

00:25.300 --> 00:28.400
We're calling these hypotheticals or conditional statements.

00:28.400 --> 00:33.200
Right, so there are many different types of hypotheticals or conditional statements.

00:33.200 --> 00:41.400
So today we're going to be looking at the third conditional, which is probably the hardest one because it uses a little bit of a complex grammar structure.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.400
It's complex.

00:42.400 --> 00:46.400
And we're actually talking about things that did not happen and that will not happen, right?

00:46.400 --> 00:47.400
It's impossible to change.

00:47.400 --> 00:53.400
It's impossible to change these because there are things that would have happened in the past, but didn't.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.400
Wow, that sounds confusing.

00:55.400 --> 01:01.400
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll be back to look at some phrases first.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.400
This is the good life.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.400
We have a good, don't you think?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
Yeah, of course.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.400
Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
What do you mean?

01:18.400 --> 01:23.400
Well, sometimes I think if how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.

01:23.400 --> 01:31.400
For example, like, for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.400
I see.

01:32.400 --> 01:37.400
Yeah, now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.400
You see, everything happens for a reason.

01:40.400 --> 01:45.400
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.400
Well, I have no regrets.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.400
I'll drink to that.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.400
All right, so two guys, you know, talking about life.

01:56.400 --> 02:06.400
These, I imagine these guys as being, you know, middle, middle age or a little bit older sitting on a porch drinking and beer, talking about what could have been.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.400
Yeah, exactly.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.400
They're kind of thinking about the past and the decisions they have made.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.400
Yeah, exactly.

02:12.400 --> 02:19.400
All right, so before we start in the grammar, why don't we take a look at a couple of different phrases on fluency builder?

02:19.400 --> 02:21.400
Fluency builder.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.400
Well, Marko, this first phrase is a phrase you'll hear very often in English.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.400
It's a phrase that even has philosophical roots.

02:29.400 --> 02:35.400
Something we talked a lot about when we were studying soccer teams back in the school, but this is the good life.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
The good life.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.400
We have the good life, all right?

02:38.400 --> 02:39.400
Have a good life.

02:39.400 --> 02:44.400
I have a good life is a very common phrase, but here the good life is an idiom.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.400
So I'm living the good life.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.400
Means, you know, I have no complaints about my life.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.400
Right, so pretty much you have all your necessities covered.

02:52.400 --> 02:57.400
And maybe you have a good, a nice family and you have a good job and you're just happy.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.400
So this is the good life.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.400
Very good.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.400
So you have the good life.

03:02.400 --> 03:07.400
Now, moving on to another phrase that's kind of also a philosophical, you know,

03:07.400 --> 03:11.400
it says everything happens for a reason.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.400
All right.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.400
So this phrase is, well, it's also pretty common.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.400
People say this when bad things happen, but they also say this when good things happen.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
Yeah.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.400
So basically, you're just saying that it's destiny.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.400
If this bad thing happened to you, there is a reason for it.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.400
Maybe you don't see it now.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.400
Maybe not tomorrow, but maybe later you'll see why.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.400
This often happens when people lose their jobs.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.400
You say, well, you know, everything happens for a reason.

03:37.400 --> 03:42.400
Maybe losing this job will allow you to find a better job.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.400
Or maybe go back to school and study.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.400
Or maybe meet the man or woman of your dreams.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.400
Right.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.400
So everything happens for a reason.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.400
Very good.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.400
And then the guy agrees and says, well, I'll drink to that.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.400
Okay.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.400
So this is a way for people speaking English to say listen.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.400
I agree with you.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.400
I like that idea.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.400
And I will cheers.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.400
Right.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.400
Right.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
So this means we're going to touch our glasses or touch our beer bottles.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.400
And we're going to, you know, think about how this is a nice thought.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.400
You know, everything happens for a reason is positive.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.400
It's a way to say listen.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
Good things going to happen from.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.400
Right.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.400
So he's saying, yes, I agree.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.400
Cheers.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.400
I'll drink to that.

04:20.400 --> 04:21.400
I'll drink to that.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.400
All right.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.400
Well, pretty interesting phrases.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.400
You know, they're very common, I guess, like, colloquial, right?

04:27.400 --> 04:30.400
So you can use them in everyday conversation with a friend.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.400
You can.

04:31.400 --> 04:36.400
And, you know, oftentimes we say, for example, something really positive.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.400
Like, I'm really glad I have such great friends.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.400
And then everyone says, oh, I'll drink to that.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.400
Right.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.400
And so this is something you'll hear when you're out with friends or with family.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.400
And they may sound funny at first.

04:47.400 --> 04:51.400
But you will recognize them when you're speaking to people who's speaking English.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
All right.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.400
So, right.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.400
So let's listen to our dialogue again.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.400
And then we'll come back and explain the grammar.

04:56.400 --> 05:03.400
This is the good life.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.400
We have it good.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
Don't you think?

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
Yeah.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
Of course.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.400
Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.400
What do you mean?

05:14.400 --> 05:20.400
Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things

05:20.400 --> 05:22.400
a little differently.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
For example?

05:23.400 --> 05:25.400
Like, for example,

05:25.400 --> 05:31.400
if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.400
I see.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
Yeah.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.400
Now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
and met Sally.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.400
You see, everything happens for a reason.

05:42.400 --> 05:48.400
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.400
Well, I have no regrets.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.400
I'll drink to that.

05:56.400 --> 06:01.400
Alright, so now it's time for grammar breakdown.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.400
Raman breakdown.

06:03.400 --> 06:07.400
So in grammar breakdown, we're going to look at the two main parts of these phrases

06:07.400 --> 06:10.400
that allow us to talk about things that didn't happen.

06:10.400 --> 06:16.400
So we're talking about looking back at our life and seeing what decisions and what actions we made.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.400
And in this case, we have a great sentence here.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.400
If I hadn't studied architecture,

06:23.400 --> 06:25.400
I would have become an artist.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.400
Alright.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.400
So let's look at the first part before the common.

06:29.400 --> 06:33.400
If I hadn't studied architecture, so now we have the conditional if.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.400
So Mark, a big question.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
Did he study architecture?

06:36.400 --> 06:37.400
He did.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
He did.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400
So if I hadn't studied architecture,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
I mean, I did study architecture.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.400
But if I had not studied it,

06:45.400 --> 06:49.400
okay, so this is if I could change the past,

06:49.400 --> 06:51.400
then what would I have done?

06:51.400 --> 06:54.400
I would have become an artist.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.400
Okay, so he wanted to be an artist,

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
but he didn't become an artist.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.400
He studied architecture instead.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.400
Right.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
Very good.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.400
You can see the two parts here.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.400
We have one, the condition.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.400
If I hadn't done this thing.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.400
And then afterwards, we have the result.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.400
Then I would have become an artist.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.400
So this is the hypothetical.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.400
Very good.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.400
And when we see the condition, you see the,

07:16.400 --> 07:19.400
the structure of the sentence is had.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.400
Plus verb in past participle.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.400
So if I hadn't studied architecture,

07:24.400 --> 07:27.400
and this is called the past perfect.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.400
And then the result, as you said,

07:29.400 --> 07:32.400
would have become this is the present perfect.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.400
Have her has plus verb in past participle.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.400
Let's look at another example.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.400
I wouldn't have gotten married

07:40.400 --> 07:43.400
if I hadn't moved to this town.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.400
Okay, so we've got the same idea here,

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
but we've got it flipped.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.400
We've got these two parts in different places.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.400
And so he's pretty much saying,

07:53.400 --> 07:55.400
if I hadn't moved to this town,

07:55.400 --> 07:57.400
then I wouldn't have gotten married.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.400
But what did happen?

07:59.400 --> 08:00.400
He did move to this town,

08:00.400 --> 08:01.400
and he did get married.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.400
Exactly.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.400
So then yeah, like you say,

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
he changed the condition.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
And you can do this.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.400
You can put the condition in the beginning or at the end.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
And again, the structure is the same.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.400
I would have gotten married, right?

08:13.400 --> 08:15.400
Have gotten this is present perfect.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.400
Have her has depending on the subject,

08:17.400 --> 08:19.400
plus the verb in past participle.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.400
And then the past perfect or the condition had

08:23.400 --> 08:27.400
plus verb in past participle hadn't moved to this town.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.400
All right, that's a lot of grammar.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.400
It's a lot of grammar,

08:30.400 --> 08:33.400
but it's very easy once you just start using it.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.400
Don't think too much about,

08:35.400 --> 08:36.400
okay, what do I do here?

08:36.400 --> 08:37.400
Just, you know,

08:37.400 --> 08:41.400
if you get the rhythm and you start using it in the same way,

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
then it kind of comes out naturally.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.400
And if you make a little mistake,

08:44.400 --> 08:46.400
it's not a big deal because even we do it, you know?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.400
Exactly. Well, let's try a couple of examples.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
Not the top of our heads first of all.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.400
If I hadn't moved to China,

08:53.400 --> 08:56.400
I wouldn't have learned Chinese.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.400
Very good.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.400
So you did move to China,

08:58.400 --> 08:59.400
and you did learn Chinese.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.400
Exactly.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.400
So your turn.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.400
All right.

09:02.400 --> 09:07.400
If my parents hadn't spoken Spanish to me when I was a kid,

09:07.400 --> 09:10.400
I wouldn't have become fluent in Spanish.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.400
Okay, so your parents did speak Spanish,

09:12.400 --> 09:14.400
and you did become fluent in Spanish.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
So not bad.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
Right.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
As you can see,

09:17.400 --> 09:20.400
you can use it not only to think about things in the past

09:20.400 --> 09:21.400
that you can't change anymore,

09:21.400 --> 09:23.400
but just also, you know,

09:23.400 --> 09:24.400
kind of remember or say,

09:24.400 --> 09:25.400
you know,

09:25.400 --> 09:26.400
oh, if this hadn't happened,

09:26.400 --> 09:27.400
the result.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.400
Or if I hadn't opened my big mouth,

09:30.400 --> 09:33.400
my best friend wouldn't have gotten so angry at me.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.400
Exactly.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.400
So I said something stupid,

09:36.400 --> 09:38.400
and my friend did get angry.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.400
And now I feel bad about it.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.400
It happens.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.400
All right, very good.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
I hope it's clear.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
It does sound a little bit complicated,

09:44.400 --> 09:46.400
but this is what our website is for, right?

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
So if you have questions or doubts,

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
or you want to try and plant your own ideas,

09:50.400 --> 09:51.400
you can come to the website and do it.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.400
I want to make some of your own sentences,

09:53.400 --> 09:55.400
and practice some of these new things,

09:55.400 --> 09:56.400
then come to our website,

09:56.400 --> 09:57.400
post some comments,

09:57.400 --> 10:00.400
and we're happy to correct and add our own commentary on those.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.400
Exactly.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.400
So before we go,

10:02.400 --> 10:04.400
let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

10:04.400 --> 10:14.400
This is the good life.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
We have a good, don't you think?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.400
Yeah, of course.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.400
Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?

10:21.400 --> 10:22.400
What do you mean?

10:22.400 --> 10:24.400
Well, sometimes I think

10:24.400 --> 10:26.400
if how things could have turned out

10:26.400 --> 10:28.400
if I had done things a little differently.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
For example,

10:29.400 --> 10:31.400
like, for example,

10:31.400 --> 10:33.400
if I hadn't studied architecture,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.400
it would have become an artist like I wanted to.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.400
I see.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
Yeah,

10:37.400 --> 10:38.400
now that I think of it,

10:38.400 --> 10:39.400
I wouldn't have gotten married

10:39.400 --> 10:42.400
if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.400
You see,

10:43.400 --> 10:45.400
everything happens for a reason.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
We wouldn't even have met.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.400
If I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago,

10:49.400 --> 10:50.400
well,

10:50.400 --> 10:51.400
I have no regrets.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.400
I'm drink to that.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.400
All right,

11:01.400 --> 11:02.400
so Catherine,

11:02.400 --> 11:03.400
any other regrets,

11:03.400 --> 11:04.400
maybe in your life,

11:04.400 --> 11:06.400
apart from opening your mouth?

11:06.400 --> 11:07.400
Any other regrets?

11:07.400 --> 11:12.400
If my parents had spoken to me as a kid,

11:12.400 --> 11:13.400
I would have learned.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.400
But instead,

11:14.400 --> 11:15.400
I just learned English,

11:15.400 --> 11:16.400
and that's all.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.400
Well, your mom is a half a Swedish, right?

11:19.400 --> 11:20.400
Half Swedish,

11:20.400 --> 11:21.400
half-check.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.400
So, and she never spoke any of these languages here.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.400
She, no,

11:24.400 --> 11:26.400
she didn't speak Swedish or check her parents,

11:26.400 --> 11:28.400
spoke English as their common language.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.400
But she grew up speaking Italian and German,

11:31.400 --> 11:33.400
but she didn't speak to me in those languages,

11:33.400 --> 11:34.400
and then as an adult,

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
she forgot some of them,

11:36.400 --> 11:37.400
and so,

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
because my dad was,

11:39.400 --> 11:41.400
well, they're both Americans now,

11:41.400 --> 11:43.400
but my dad's American.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
They're just booking those to me.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
Wow,

11:45.400 --> 11:46.400
but now you speak Italian,

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
so do you ever try and talk to your mom in Italian?

11:48.400 --> 11:49.400
Sometimes,

11:49.400 --> 11:51.400
my grandmother's Italian is much better,

11:51.400 --> 11:53.400
so my grandmother's completely fluent,

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
so I speak to her in Italian.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.400
And,

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
and German as well,

11:56.400 --> 11:57.400
she's fluent and German too,

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
and I speak German as well.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.400
So,

11:59.400 --> 12:00.400
See, this is the interesting thing.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.400
Now, so many people are speaking so many languages,

12:03.400 --> 12:04.400
and before,

12:04.400 --> 12:06.400
if you spoke another foreign language,

12:06.400 --> 12:07.400
it was a big deal.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.400
But now,

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
it's like a requirement.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.400
You have to at least dominate your own native language,

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
and a foreign language, right?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
So, if your native language is English,

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
you at least have to speak Spanish or Chinese,

12:18.400 --> 12:19.400
or some other language.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.400
Definitely true,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.400
and I think there are a lot of people,

12:22.400 --> 12:24.400
a lot of our users,

12:24.400 --> 12:26.400
that speak maybe two or three languages,

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
and English is just one more.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.400
So,

12:29.400 --> 12:30.400
you know, more power to them.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.400
This is a really great skill to have,

12:32.400 --> 12:34.400
and I think it's really important to keep on going with it,

12:34.400 --> 12:35.400
even though it's frustrating.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.400
Right.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.400
And actually, once you've been able,

12:38.400 --> 12:41.400
and actually once you mastered two or three different languages,

12:41.400 --> 12:43.400
then the fourth and fifth just becomes easier.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
Actually, it's true.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.400
It sounds funny when you hear it,

12:47.400 --> 12:48.400
because you're like,

12:48.400 --> 12:50.400
how could it be easier to learn more?

12:50.400 --> 12:53.400
But your brain starts to understand patterns better,

12:53.400 --> 12:54.400
right?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
And so, it just becomes more natural for you.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.400
It picks up patterns from the two or three other different languages

12:58.400 --> 12:59.400
that you dominate.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.400
So, it's a weird, it's strange how the brain works.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.400
You can actually.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.400
Yeah.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.400
All right, guys.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.400
So, that's all for today.
