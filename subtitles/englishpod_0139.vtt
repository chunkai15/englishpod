00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello everyone, welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Hi guys, my name is Katherine.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
And today we're going to be looking at another lesson as part of our sports series and this time

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Well, it's a debate, is it a game or is it a sport?

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh, it's a sport, you have to work your mind.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Yeah, so we're looking at chess, a very old, very popular sport, very difficult to play as well.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
It takes a lot of practice and believe me, it's frustrating at the beginning.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
It's still kind of in the beginning, in immediate stages, but yeah, it takes a lot of practice and it takes a lot of time to familiarize yourself with the rules.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Right.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
So we're going to be learning a little bit more about the pieces and the rules today.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Okay, perfect, so we're not going to preview anything.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and talk about the sport.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
Bobby, come here.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Look what I got here.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
What is that?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
A chessboard.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Daddy's going to teach you how to play.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Cool.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Okay.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Each player gets 16 pieces.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
You can be the white ones and I'll play with black pieces.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Now in the front, we'll set up the pods.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Those are the least viable pieces and can only move one space for.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
When you're about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What about all these other pieces?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
See this one looks like a tower?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
It's called the rook.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
The one with the tall hat is called the bishop.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
See this little horsey?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
This is called the knight.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
It's a very important piece, so it's best not to let your opponent capture it.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
And these two, they are huffin' wife.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
That's right.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
That's the queen.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
And that's the king.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
If the other player captures your king, he will say checkmate.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And the game is over.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Doesn't this sound fun?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Nah.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
This sounds boring.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I'm gonna go play killer zombies on my PlayStation.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Alright, so the kid is obviously not very interested in learning how to play chess.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
Not at all, you know, the arts of these kind of slower games might be your place very soon by video games.

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, I guess it doesn't really appeal to a little nine-year-old or ten-year-old instead of, you know, playing something like this versus, yeah, shooting.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Exactly.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
But it's a very great game.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
It's very difficult, like we mentioned.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
So we're gonna look at the name of the pieces and the rules that are related to these pieces in language takeaway.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Language takeaway.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
Well, the first one you might have heard before because this is a word that is often used in strategy in general.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
So, um, they're pawn.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
A pawn.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
A pawn usually means something that is not very important that you can use to distract an opponent.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Mm-hmm.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
Alright, so on the chess where you have eight pawns, so these are the ones that you have the most, but their movement is very limited.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
So they can only move two spaces forward on the first move, right?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Right, or one space after that.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
One space forward.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
And only when it's going to capture another piece, can it move diagonally?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Alright, so you can't just go diagonally.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
You have to go forward until you're going to take another person's piece to capture it and to go diagonally.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Alright.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
But a pawn is funny.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
You can also use this word when you're talking about other things, like, he used her as a pawn in his little game.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
So you want to make an analogy, you want to make a comparison from life to these games you can use the word pawn.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Very good.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
Now, moving on to the other pieces on the chessboard, on the very far ends of the board, you have the rook.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Okay, you've got two of these, and they kind of look like towers from a castle.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Mm-hmm.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
And it's a very, well, they're very important pieces, and actually my favorite pieces, because they're not very important that the beginning of a game,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
but at the end of a game boom, boom, boom, you can do a lot of damage,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
because they can go anywhere in straight lines.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
Right, so they can go forward backwards and to the sides, as many spaces as they want.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
The whole board, if they want.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah, so easy pieces to forget about at the beginning, but they're very important.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And now, next to the rook, we have the bishop.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Because this is very different from the rook because the bishop can also go anywhere, but they can only go diagonally.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Right, so only diagonally.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
They can also move forward directions, but diagonally, right?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Exactly.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
So you can go forward and backward, but it has to be in a diagonal, slanted line.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Okay.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
And now, next to the bishop, we have the knight.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Ooh, the knight.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
So he's the one galloping on the horse, like those old stories of King Arthur race to hear.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
But the knight can go in an L shape, and I've never understood this, but it's weird.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
So it can move two spaces forward and then one to the right, or one to the left,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
or it can move two spaces to the right, and then one forward.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
So it's very strange, but it always has to move three spaces, and in the shape of an L.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
So I thought maybe he was the drunken piece.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
He can go forward a little bit, then don't don't do that.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Right, so that's the knight.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
It's actually a very, very important piece as well.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
And now the two main pieces, maybe, of the chess board, the Queen and King.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
So the King is kind of sad.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
He can only move one space, but the Queen is really the killer.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Because she can do anything she wants.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
This is interesting, right?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
What do they make it like that?

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
The Queen can move as many spaces as she wants, and any direction.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
While the King can do the same, and he's direction he wants, but only one space.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I think there's some similarity between real life now.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
It's like the Queen can do anything she wants, and the King can kind of do whatever he wants.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
Well, maybe it has to do with the fact that he has to stay put and represent the country.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
And she can move around and move behind the scenes and has a little bit more mobility.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Maybe.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Who knows?

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
So, but in the end, the most important piece is the King, right?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Once the King is captured, the game is over.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Exactly.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
So, let's listen to today's dialogue one more time and slow it down a bit and find out

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
if the boy understood any of these rules.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Bobby, come here.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Look what I got you.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
What is that?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
A chessboard.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Daddy's going to teach you how to play.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Cool.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Okay.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Each player gets 16 pieces.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
You can be the white ones, and I'll play with black pieces.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Now in the front, you set up the pawns.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Those are the least viable pieces, and can only move one space forward.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
When you're about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
What about all these other pieces?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
See, this one looks like a tower.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
It's called the rook.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
The one with the tall hat is called the bishop.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
See, this little horsey?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
This is called the knight.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
It's a very important piece, so it's best not to let your opponent capture it.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
And these two?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
They are husband and wife.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
That's right.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
That's the queen, and that's the king.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
If the other player captures your king, he will say,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Checkmate, and the game is over.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Doesn't this sound fun?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Nah.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
This sounds boring.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I'm going to go play killer zombies on my PlayStation.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Alright, we're back, and now we don't

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
We explain a couple of these phrases that we also use to explain the pieces,

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
but let's look at some of these more in depth now in Fluency Builder.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Fluency Builder.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
So Marka, one of the first phrases that we heard,

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
was the phrase to move diagonally, or a diagonal line.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
And so the pawns can sometimes do this,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
and the bishop can do this.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
What does it mean to move diagonally?

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
Okay, so basically a diagonal line is not a line that goes straight up,

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
right?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Straight up to the sky, for example, or to the side.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Right?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
It goes at an angle, so it's maybe going at

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
45 degrees or 30 degrees, so that's a diagonal movement or diagonal line.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
The next phrase we have is very strange,

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
and this one you might hear from parents or children.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
He says a little horsey.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
A little horsey, so in many languages we have ways of breaking down words,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
or adding to words to make them sound cuter.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And this is one of those cases.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
So for example, a little puppy, or a little kitty, or kitten,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
these are words to make, to make things sound cuter.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
So in this case, horse becomes horsey.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Horsey, so I want to ride the horsey.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
It's a cute way of saying I want to ride the cute horse.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Mommy, mommy, I want to ride the horsey.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Exactly.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
So baby talk often involves having these rhyming words.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Mommy, horsey, doggy, puppy.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
A doggy, exactly. Very good.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
So it's a cute way of saying something.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
And now when we were talking about the chest pieces,

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
when another piece takes or gets a piece,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
you say it captures it.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Okay, we say capture because maybe it's a bit nicer than killing it,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
but capture means taking and keeping for yourself.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
So we have a very popular game in America called Capture the Flag.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Right, so where you have to take each other's flag, right?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
You're stealing.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
You're stealing.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
So yeah, this is the term that is used in chest to capture another piece.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Sometimes, for example, in Spanish,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
we actually say like to eat the other piece.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Really?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah, you eat it.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
That's true.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, we're a little bit more tame.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Those English-speaking countries, but to capture is a very important phrase,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
and you're going to hear that in the news as well,

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
because you can capture a person.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You can capture a criminal.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
All right.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
And the final word and the way that you end a game of chess,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
you say, checkmate.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Checkmate.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Checkmate.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Checkmate.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
So the game's over.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Checkmate.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Well, there's two things that can happen at the end of a game,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
and well, only one thing can happen at the very end of a game,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
but you're going to hear these two phrases.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And one is check and the other is checkmate.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
So check means that I can take your king if I want to.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Move.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Right, it's in danger.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
It's in danger, but checkmate is the end all.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
This means this is the very, very last part of a game,

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
where you cannot do anything I've trapped you and I went.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Right.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Very good.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
The game is over when somebody says checkmate.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this very interesting game.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Bobby, come here.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Look what I got here.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
What is that?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
But just board.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Daddy's going to teach you how to play.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Cool.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Okay.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Each player gets 16 pieces.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
You can be the white ones.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And I'll play with black pieces.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Now in the front, we set up the pawns.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Those are the least viable pieces,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
and can only move one space forward.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
When you're about to capture another piece,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
they can move one space diagonally.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
What about all these other pieces?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
See this one looks like a tower.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
It's called the rook.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
The one with the tall hat is called the bishop.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
See this little horsey?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
This is called the knight.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
It's a very important piece,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
so it's best not to let your opponent capture it.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
And these two?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
They are huffin' wife.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
That's right.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
That's the queen.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
And that's the king.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
If the other player captures your king,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
he will say checkmate.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And the game is over.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Doesn't this sound fun?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Nah.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
This sounds boring.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm gonna go play killer zombies on my PlayStation.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Pop quiz, Marco.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
All right.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
The word check and the word mate.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
They both have meanings in English,

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
but put together.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
What does this phrase come from?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
What could it possibly mean?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I have no idea.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Why don't you tell us?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Because I seriously don't know where it comes from.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Okay, well, this is actually very interesting,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
so I looked it up.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
And I had no idea either,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
because we've always just said this.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Right.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
And it doesn't really make sense.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So I looked it up on the internet.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
And I discovered that the game of chess

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
was actually very ancient game.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Mm-hmm.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
And it did not come from England.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
It did not come from France.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
So it actually came from Persia.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Mm-hmm.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
And in Persian, there are some words that kind of became the English words checkmate.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
That mean the king is captured or the king is defeated.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Mm-hmm.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Right.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Okay.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
So that's what it means.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
It doesn't mean the king is dead.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
No.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
It doesn't mean that he's dead.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
It means that he's been taken.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Okay.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
And so over time, the Persian word went into Arabic and Arabic became French and English.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
And then now we say checkmate.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Checkmate.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Okay.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Interesting.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
This is a very interesting word.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
And I'm sure everybody that's listening has a different translation for it in their own language.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
I know, for example, that in Spanish, we would say Hake Matte.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Hake Matte.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Right.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
So I guess like Hake is something's in check.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
It's in danger.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And then Matte kind of like kill.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Mm-hmm.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
So maybe it's probably not translated properly because as you mentioned,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
it should mean defeated or captured not killed.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
So listeners, why don't you let us know how you say checkmate in your language.
