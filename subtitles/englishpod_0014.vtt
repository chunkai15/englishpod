Hello English learners, and welcome to another great podcast with EnglishPod.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.160
My name is Marco, and I'm Erica.

00:08.160 --> 00:12.560
And today we have another really great lesson for you, elementary lesson.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.840
That's right, and it's another lesson about money.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.280
We have no money here at EnglishPod. We are in debt.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.760
In debt? Yes. Okay.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.360
In debt? So what does that mean? What don't you tell us?

00:25.440 --> 00:29.200
If I owe you money, I'm in debt.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.040
In debt? In fact, I think I am in debt to you.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.160
You owe me 250 for a coke zero today. That's true.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.920
All right. Okay, so let's get started. Let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

00:42.800 --> 00:50.720
The vocabulary preview. We have two words today in our vocabulary preview, and the first one is

00:50.800 --> 00:59.200
Recession recession recession recession. So recession. Everyone's talking about it right now,

00:59.200 --> 01:07.120
and what does it mean? I don't know. That's your job. I don't know. I really don't know.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.200
Why don't you tell me, Erica, because this isn't my topic for today. Okay.

01:11.200 --> 01:20.000
Recession is a period of time when the economy of a country is doing badly.

01:20.080 --> 01:25.360
In a recession, the country is making less money. That's true. So maybe we can give a few

01:25.360 --> 01:30.160
examples of things that happen in a recession to show the meaning of this a little bit better.

01:30.160 --> 01:37.520
Right. So for example, in a recession, many people lose their jobs because companies might

01:37.520 --> 01:44.720
close or go bankrupt. Exactly. And also, people start spending less money. That's true.

01:44.800 --> 01:52.800
And the stock prices of companies fall pretty dry. Yeah, they follow a lot. Yeah. Yeah. And that's

01:52.800 --> 02:00.400
what's going on now in the United States. Very true. Okay. So let's take a look at our second word,

02:00.400 --> 02:08.080
and it has to do with recession. It's broke. Broke. Broke. I'm broke. Broke. It means that you

02:08.080 --> 02:14.160
have no money. You're broke. I'm broke. Right. So these are our two words for vocabulary

02:14.160 --> 02:19.440
preview today. And you're going to hear them in the dialogue. This dialogue is about a man who

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
is in debt. He's broke. Let's find out what happens.

02:38.080 --> 02:44.160
See Mr. Corleone. Right this way, sir.

02:53.920 --> 02:59.200
Johnny. What can I do for you? Mr. Corleone. I'm really sorry to trouble you,

02:59.200 --> 03:04.320
but I need your help. Anything for you, Johnny. Your father was like a brother to me.

03:05.120 --> 03:11.120
Well, sir, you see, this recession is hit me pretty hard. I lost my job, and I'm in a lot of debt.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.720
I see. Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments. I've got to pay my mortgage.

03:18.720 --> 03:26.960
And on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition. Well, I just thought maybe you could

03:27.040 --> 03:34.160
help me out. What? Any time like this? I'm broke, too, you know. You're not the only one who's been hit

03:34.160 --> 03:47.760
by the recession. I lost half my money in the stock market crash going. Get out of here.

03:57.920 --> 04:03.440
Okay, so that was a bit unexpected. Yeah, that was certainly strange. He didn't go to the bank,

04:03.440 --> 04:09.680
to ask for money. Did he? No, he went to the mob and the mob is broke. Oh, no, you know it's a

04:09.680 --> 04:15.280
bad recession when even the mob runs out of money. All right, so why don't we start by looking at

04:15.280 --> 04:23.680
our language takeaway? Language takeaway. All right, so for today's language takeaway, we have

04:23.760 --> 04:31.200
four words from the dialogue, which we think are really important. Yes, so why don't we start with the

04:31.200 --> 04:40.640
first one? Loan. Loan. Loan. Loan. So Erica, tell us about a loan. What is a loan? Okay,

04:40.640 --> 04:49.520
when you borrow money, you get a loan. A loan, yes. Not to be confused with a loan, like by myself.

04:49.600 --> 04:56.880
No, so this is L-O-A-N loan. Right. Okay, great. Let's take a look at our second word,

04:57.680 --> 05:04.880
mortgage mortgage mortgage mortgage mortgage. Now, this is very common. I'm sure many of you have

05:04.880 --> 05:12.400
mortgages. What is a mortgage? A mortgage is a type of a loan. Basically, it's a loan that

05:12.400 --> 05:19.360
helps you to buy a house or a property. Yeah, so this is a funny word. I mean, there's this strange

05:19.520 --> 05:25.840
mortgage with a tea. Yeah, it has a tea in it, but you don't pronounce it. You say mortgage. So not

05:25.840 --> 05:33.200
mort, mortgages. Not mortgages. Mortgages. Yeah, I had trouble spelling that one for this lesson, so

05:33.200 --> 05:43.680
I learned it well now. Okay, let's move to our third word today. Hit me pretty hard. Hit me pretty hard.

05:43.760 --> 05:51.120
Hit me pretty hard. I think we have some examples that will help us understand this phrase.

05:53.120 --> 06:02.160
Example one. My divorce hit me pretty hard. I'm so depressed.

06:03.040 --> 06:07.360
Example two.

06:11.440 --> 06:15.440
This cold is hit me pretty hard. I've been in bed for a week.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.800
Example three.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.520
The news of fluffy's death hit me pretty hard. I've been crying for days.

06:32.560 --> 06:38.640
Okay, so that's a lot clear. Yeah, great. Why don't we take a look at our last word for language

06:38.640 --> 06:46.320
takeaway? tuition tuition tuition tuition tuition. So this is the money you have to pay to your school

06:46.320 --> 06:51.840
so that you can study there. Right. Um, usually it's in college, right, or university.

06:51.840 --> 06:57.840
Yeah, but sometimes in some countries you have to pay tuition for public school. Okay, great.

06:57.840 --> 07:03.760
So it's time to listen to our dialogue again, and it's going to be slower. So we can listen to all the

07:03.760 --> 07:05.360
words that we just talked about.

07:15.600 --> 07:21.440
Hello, I'm here to see Mr. Corleon. Right this way, sir.

07:21.680 --> 07:33.360
Charlie, what can I do for you? Mr. Corleon, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.800
Anything for you, Charlie, your father was like a brother to me.

07:39.600 --> 07:47.280
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard. I lost my job, and I'm in a lot of debt.

07:47.360 --> 07:58.000
I see. Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments. I've got to pay my mortgage

07:58.640 --> 08:06.320
and on top of all that. I have to pay my son's college tuition. So you're asking for a loan.

08:07.520 --> 08:14.800
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out. What? At a time like this,

08:15.520 --> 08:21.680
I'm broke too, you know. You're not the only one who has been hit by the recession.

08:21.680 --> 08:27.520
I lost half my money in the stock market crash. Go on, get out of here.

08:33.760 --> 08:39.200
Okay, so I think a lot of the key language we just talked about is a lot more clear now.

08:39.200 --> 08:46.160
But you know, I also noticed some really interesting phrases in this dialogue. Yes, I did, too.

08:46.160 --> 08:55.040
So let's start with fluency builder fluency builder fluency builder is a tool that we use to

08:55.040 --> 09:01.440
help you sound more native. Right. So you can sound more natural when you're speaking. So we take

09:01.440 --> 09:08.800
a really common phrase and we show you some great natural ways of expressing that same idea exactly

09:08.880 --> 09:14.000
and today we have three of these examples. Let's start with the first one. So this phrase we use

09:14.000 --> 09:23.680
when we want to ask somebody, can I help you? What can I do for you? What can I do for you?

09:24.960 --> 09:31.520
Yeah, that sounds really, really polite and really natural. Right. So instead of saying can I help you?

09:31.520 --> 09:38.320
Or, I don't know, what do you need? We can just say, what can I do for you? Exactly. So let's move

09:38.400 --> 09:44.240
to our second phrase. This phrase we use when we need something. When we want to say,

09:44.240 --> 09:52.720
I'm sorry to bother you. Or, I'm sorry to interrupt. Okay, let's listen. I'm really sorry to

09:52.720 --> 10:01.760
trouble you. I'm really sorry to trouble you. I'm sorry to trouble you. This phrase might be a

10:01.760 --> 10:07.440
little bit more difficult to understand how it's used. But we've got some examples. Yes. So let's

10:08.080 --> 10:19.360
listen. Example one. Can I trouble you for a moment? I just need you to sign this form for me.

10:23.360 --> 10:30.800
Example two. I'm sorry to trouble you, but may I go home early today.

10:31.120 --> 10:43.120
Example three. Can I trouble you for a pen? Mine is not working anymore.

10:46.560 --> 10:53.920
Okay, so now let's take a look at our last phrase for fluency builder. On top of all that. On top of all that.

10:53.920 --> 11:00.560
On top of all that. This is a really useful phrase. Marco, how would you use it? Well, for example,

11:00.640 --> 11:07.840
today I lost my job. Oh, no. My car got stolen. Oh, my God. And on top of all that,

11:07.840 --> 11:14.160
my girlfriend broke up with me. That was a terrible day. It was. But don't worry. You can use this

11:14.160 --> 11:21.360
phrase also in a positive way. That's true. You could say. So today was a really great day.

11:21.360 --> 11:27.760
It was my birthday and all my friends came to visit me. And on top of all that, I got a million

11:27.920 --> 11:34.960
presents. That is a great day. So you can use on top of all that in this way. It's like and also.

11:35.360 --> 11:41.520
And also yeah. Yeah. So on top of all that. So we are ready to listen to our dialogue a third time.

11:41.520 --> 11:46.560
We can hear all the words that we just talked about in all the phrases. And you'll definitely be able

11:46.560 --> 11:48.560
to understand a lot better now.

11:58.640 --> 12:02.240
Hello, I'm here to see Mr. Corleoni. Right this way, sir.

12:15.680 --> 12:22.160
Johnny, what can I do for you? Mr. Corleoni, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

12:22.320 --> 12:28.320
Anything for you, Johnny. Your father was like a brother to me. Well, sir, you see,

12:29.040 --> 12:32.880
this recession has hit me pretty hard. I lost my job and I'm in a lot of debt.

12:33.680 --> 12:40.400
I see. Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments. I've got to pay my mortgage.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.520
And on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.120
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

12:49.840 --> 12:57.040
What? Any time like this? I'm broke, too, you know. You're not the only one who's been hit by the recession.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.960
I lost half my money in the stock market crash. Go on. Get out of here.

13:01.520 --> 13:18.800
Today's dialogue was all about being in debt, right? Yes.

13:18.800 --> 13:24.960
And different people have different attitudes or different viewpoints on being in debts.

13:25.600 --> 13:31.120
Yes, that's true. For example, in North America and in Canada, it's a really common thing.

13:31.120 --> 13:37.040
Yeah, it's actually almost good to be in debt. It's more than good. It's necessary to be in debt.

13:37.040 --> 13:44.240
That's right. Unless you have a history of being in debt and regularly paying off your debts,

13:44.880 --> 13:50.160
you can't actually borrow money. You can't get a mortgage. You can't get a car alone.

13:50.160 --> 13:55.760
So you can buy a new car. Right. That's called a credit history. So you must have a good credit

13:55.760 --> 14:01.600
history in order to be able to, like you say, buy a car or buy a house. Yeah, and you know, the funny

14:01.600 --> 14:07.920
thing is, when I was in university, maybe it was 18 years old. The first thing that happened at

14:07.920 --> 14:13.760
university was, you know, banks came to our university and started offering you credit cards. So you

14:13.760 --> 14:18.960
can get a credit card when you're 18, no problem. And not only do they offer you credit cards,

14:19.120 --> 14:23.840
they give you free gifts if you sign up for credit cards. I know they really want you to have a

14:23.840 --> 14:28.400
credit card. Of course, they want you to spend more money. That's the trick. Yeah, but you know,

14:28.400 --> 14:33.600
it's totally different in Europe. For example, I used to live in Switzerland and there they're

14:33.600 --> 14:39.520
really careful with debt. Like it's a bad thing to be in debt. Well, yeah, I mean, it's bad to be in debt,

14:39.520 --> 14:45.280
definitely. For example, if I want to have a credit card in Switzerland and let's say I want to have a

14:45.360 --> 14:54.400
limit of 500 francs that I can spend every month. I need to put in my bank account 700 francs

14:54.400 --> 15:00.400
before I can even spend that credit card money. So it's totally opposite from North America.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.920
Well, yeah, I mean, in North America, it's crazy the way that people are in debt and it's showing

15:05.920 --> 15:12.000
now with the recession, right? Yeah, that's true. So everyone be sure to handle your money carefully.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.600
Don't be in debt unless you really, really have to. Good financial advice from English pod financial
