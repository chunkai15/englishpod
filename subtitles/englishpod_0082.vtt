Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.280 --> 00:06.400
And I'm Erica.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.400
And today we're bringing you the next part of our suspense series, the new guy in town.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.520
That's right.

00:11.520 --> 00:15.200
So we know that our mod wasn't really a vampire that he was just acting.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.200
And the women aren't quite what they see in this dialogue.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.520
In the last one, something happened and she transformed into some sort of,

00:23.520 --> 00:24.880
I don't know, creature, right?

00:24.880 --> 00:26.160
Monster!

00:26.160 --> 00:28.480
Right, so now let's see what happens.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.120
So we're not going to preview any vocabulary this time.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.680
Let's just listen to the dialogue and see what happens.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.640
But to think it's going on, did you see that?

00:48.640 --> 00:49.680
What was that thing?

00:49.680 --> 00:50.480
I don't know.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.520
I'm just how we made it up.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.160
Look, there's a police car.

00:54.800 --> 00:55.680
Help!

00:55.680 --> 00:57.120
Help, please, please stop!

00:58.640 --> 01:01.840
All right, go take one of five door cameras.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.440
Oh, the man.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.640
What seems to be the problem?

01:08.640 --> 01:10.240
Is this man bothering you?

01:10.240 --> 01:10.960
Of his or her?

01:10.960 --> 01:11.920
Of his or her?

01:11.920 --> 01:14.560
There is like a witch creature back there.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.320
We tied her up, but she broke me.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.680
And she was about to have us for dinner.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.880
Okay, come down, come down.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.440
Let me see your eyes, please.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.680
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

01:26.480 --> 01:27.520
We're telling the truth.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.680
She's in there.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.280
We suspected her being a kidnapper or a rapist,

01:33.280 --> 01:36.400
but turns out she's an alien or something.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.840
Okay, calm down, calm down.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.680
Let me see your eyes, please.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.680
Oh, seriously?

01:43.680 --> 01:45.200
Are you going to help us out or not?

01:45.920 --> 01:48.720
Okay, let's go have a look, shall we?

01:58.320 --> 01:59.520
Oh, no!

02:14.160 --> 02:15.520
Hello?

02:15.520 --> 02:16.720
Is anyone in there?

02:18.960 --> 02:20.800
Be careful, she might be hiding.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.240
That's perfectly safe.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.200
There isn't anyone.

02:57.520 --> 03:06.800
Well, I don't think things are turning out very well for our housewives and our moms.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.240
Apparently the police officer is not going to make it to the next episode.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.800
All right, so we saw some really great vocabulary,

03:16.800 --> 03:18.960
and even though it's kind of a scary story,

03:18.960 --> 03:20.560
there is a lot of things we can learn.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.120
So why don't we take a look at it now in language takeaway?

03:27.680 --> 03:30.640
Well, we're going to look at five words and phrases here,

03:30.640 --> 03:38.560
and the first one, they described this woman as a kind of creature creature.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.600
All right, so what exactly is a creature?

03:41.600 --> 03:43.440
Well, a creature can be any animal.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.080
Any animal?

03:44.080 --> 03:48.400
Yeah, like from a mouse to a bird to an insect or a bug.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.640
So I can say a bird is a flying creature.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.360
Exactly.

03:51.360 --> 03:57.120
All right, but sometimes we also use it to mean an unknown and scary animal.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.680
So there's a creature under my bed.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.040
Yes, or some type of creature was attacking me.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.000
Okay, so a creature can be any sort of living thing.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.480
Exactly.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.120
All right, what about our next one?

04:11.120 --> 04:14.000
Well, the creature broke free from some ropes.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.240
All right, so to break free.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.200
Break free.

04:17.200 --> 04:17.840
Huh?

04:17.840 --> 04:18.880
And what does that mean?

04:18.880 --> 04:23.600
When you break free, you escape from something that stops you moving.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.040
Okay, so you have the ability to move again.

04:27.040 --> 04:27.520
Yes.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.480
You break free from maybe ropes or chains or even a relationship.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.720
Okay, so I can say, oh, I finally broke free from that awful relationship.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.360
Mm-hmm.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.400
Now, that's quite interesting the way we can use this in different ways.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.040
So why don't we take a look at some examples now?

04:44.080 --> 04:45.040
Example one.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.280
We tied up the dog, but he is trying to break free.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.280
Example two.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.840
I'm glad that I broke free from that horrible relationship.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.760
Example three.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.960
I want to break free from all my daily responsibilities.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.400
Okay, so break free, it's clear now.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.040
Mm-hmm.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.880
So why don't we move on to our next word?

05:20.880 --> 05:25.200
They thought that maybe this creature was a kidnapper.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.160
Kidnapper.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.200
Kidnapper.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.120
Okay, so this is a criminal.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.560
So a kidnapper is a criminal.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.040
Yep.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.640
All right, and what exactly does a kidnapper do?

05:34.640 --> 05:39.520
A kidnapper takes someone to a place and keeps them there against their will.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.240
Against their will.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.680
With force or violence.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.920
All right, so I guess that makes sense, right?

05:43.920 --> 05:46.080
Because the word has kidding, it's yet.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.680
So to take children.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.080
Yes.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.720
But it can be also you can kidnap an adult.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.360
Yes, that's true.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.000
All right.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.040
So this word can actually be used in three different ways.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.360
So we saw a kidnapper, right?

05:57.360 --> 05:58.560
Okay, that is the person.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.440
Yeah, and the verb to kidnap.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.240
Okay.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.520
Or a noun describing an action, a kidnapping.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.320
A kidnapping.

06:06.320 --> 06:06.800
Very good.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.960
Yeah, a kidnapping took place today.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.280
Okay, so very interesting word.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.240
And of course, it's illegal to be a kidnapper.

06:14.240 --> 06:14.720
Yes.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.240
So our next word is also very serious and it's also a crime, right?

06:18.240 --> 06:19.120
That's right.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.160
A rapist.

06:21.120 --> 06:21.840
A rapist.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.560
Okay, so that is a person that who forces someone to have sex.

06:26.560 --> 06:30.080
Okay, so again, against their will, I could kidnap her.

06:30.080 --> 06:30.880
Exactly.

06:30.880 --> 06:35.040
Okay, and the verb would be to rape to rape someone.

06:35.040 --> 06:40.320
Okay, so on the lighter side, we heard the police officer say something in a very strange way.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.960
He said, let me see your eyes, please.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.240
Okay, so this is an interesting phrase.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.080
It's a sound made from pushing two words together.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.240
Right, so let me.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.040
Why don't we hear a few more examples of this?

06:55.040 --> 06:58.480
And see if we can figure out what are the two words?

07:00.800 --> 07:01.680
Example one.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.280
Let me have a look inside the car.

07:08.080 --> 07:08.800
Example two.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.040
Let me go out tonight, Dad.

07:13.040 --> 07:13.440
Please.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.680
Example three.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.360
Let me think about it, and I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

07:26.640 --> 07:31.040
So basically, let me is let me let me.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.440
Yeah, let me have that pen.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.040
Okay, let me see.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.320
Now we do this also with other words, right?

07:38.320 --> 07:41.760
Yeah, another example would be, give me, give me, yeah.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.080
So that is, give me, exactly.

07:44.160 --> 07:48.080
Okay, so an interesting thing, it's not proper English, right?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.080
No, you wouldn't really write it this way.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.520
But find it in the dictionary.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.080
But it's really common when people speak.

07:54.080 --> 07:59.600
And actually it's more likely that you'll say, let me, give me, then let me, give me.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.200
Okay, very good.

08:01.200 --> 08:06.320
So I think now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the second time.

08:06.320 --> 08:10.480
And then we'll come back and look at some other phrases that we saw in our dialogue.

08:14.560 --> 08:19.040
What the heck is going on?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.400
Did you see that?

08:20.400 --> 08:22.160
What was that thing?

08:22.160 --> 08:23.200
I don't know.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.760
I'm just glad we made it out.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.560
Look, there's a police car.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.800
Help, help, please stop.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.480
Howdy, ma'am.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.040
What seems to be the problem?

08:35.040 --> 08:36.880
Is this man bothering you?

08:36.880 --> 08:42.560
Obviously, Officer, there is like a witch creature back there.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.000
We tied her up, but she broke free.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.640
And she was about to have us for dinner.

08:48.640 --> 08:52.000
Okay, calm down, calm down.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.160
Let me see your eyes, please.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.080
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.640
We are telling the truth.

08:58.640 --> 08:59.680
She's in there.

09:00.400 --> 09:09.120
We suspected her of being a kidnapper or rapist, but it turns out she's an alien or something.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.720
Okay, calm down, calm down.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.560
Let me see your eyes, please.

09:16.160 --> 09:19.680
Seriously, are you going to help us or not?

09:20.320 --> 09:23.040
Okay, let's go have a look, shall we?

09:23.840 --> 09:26.240
Hello, is anyone in here?

09:27.120 --> 09:30.000
Be careful, she might be hiding.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.400
It's perfectly safe.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.440
There isn't anyone.

09:34.400 --> 09:42.960
We're going to look at two phrases now in Fluency Builder that you might hear when you're talking about a crime.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.600
Fluency Builder.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.760
So the first phrase that we're going to look at is what the heck is going on?

09:49.760 --> 09:51.120
What the heck is going on?

09:51.120 --> 09:53.360
What the heck is going on?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.280
Okay, so this is just asking what's happening, right?

09:57.280 --> 10:00.480
Right, but it's a very strong way of saying what's happening.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.800
Yeah, what really is happening, huh?

10:02.800 --> 10:05.200
Now, why did they say what the heck?

10:05.200 --> 10:06.160
What is heck?

10:06.160 --> 10:09.200
Well, heck is sort of a polite way of saying hell.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.760
Okay, so instead of saying what the hell is going on?

10:11.760 --> 10:12.800
What the heck is going on?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.000
Now, why do you do this?

10:14.000 --> 10:20.240
Because in, especially in American English, we don't like to talk about religious words.

10:20.240 --> 10:26.080
So like hell and God and Jesus, these things are impolite and American people.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.520
Right, you don't want to offend anyone.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.280
So that's why we would have other words like, oh my gosh,

10:31.280 --> 10:35.280
for oh my God, or G's instead of Jesus.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.680
Right, okay, so that is an interesting thing.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.680
And of course, it is a little bit of a sensitive topic among some people.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.440
So that's why it's better to just use these synonyms.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.080
Yes.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.640
Okay, and what about our next phrase?

10:48.640 --> 10:51.840
So they suspected her of being a kidnapper.

10:51.840 --> 10:56.720
Okay, so suspected her of being a kidnapper.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.720
Yeah, suspect someone of being something.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.960
So I suspect she is an alien.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.760
Right, I suspect him of being a liar.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.760
Okay, so what about to suspect?

11:09.760 --> 11:11.040
What does that mean exactly?

11:11.040 --> 11:14.960
To think something that is true, but not be a hundred percent sure.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.640
So you can say, I think she is a kidnapper.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.200
Yep.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.000
Oh, I suspect her of being a kidnapper.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.200
Hmm, interesting.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.640
Why don't we hear a few more examples?

11:26.880 --> 11:27.840
Example one.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.960
The police suspected him of being a bank robber.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.560
Example two.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.240
We suspect our dog is responsible for this mess.

11:45.920 --> 11:46.960
Example three.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.800
The neighborhood suspected that our neighbor was selling drugs.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.960
All right, very good.

11:56.960 --> 12:00.000
So we've seen a lot of vocab we've seen these phrases.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.440
So I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.280
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.520
But to heck is going on, did you see that?

12:15.520 --> 12:16.560
What was that thing?

12:16.560 --> 12:17.360
I don't know.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.400
I'm just how we made it up.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.960
Look, there's a police car.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.560
Help!

12:22.560 --> 12:23.920
Help, please, please stop!

12:31.520 --> 12:32.240
How do you, man?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.600
What seems to be the problem?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.840
Is this man bothering your officer?

12:37.840 --> 12:41.440
Officer, there is like a witch creature back there.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.200
We tied her up, but she broke me.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.720
And she was about to have us for dinner.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.840
Okay, come down, come down.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.320
Let me see your eyes, please.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.640
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

12:53.360 --> 12:54.400
We're telling the truth.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.640
She's in there.

12:56.640 --> 13:03.280
We suspected her being a kidnapper or a rapist, but turns out she's an alien or something.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.720
Okay, calm down, calm down.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.480
Let me see your eyes, please.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.080
Seriously, are you going to help us out or not?

13:12.800 --> 13:15.520
Okay, let's go have a look, shall we?

13:20.320 --> 13:30.320
Oh, no!

13:41.040 --> 13:41.680
Hello?

13:42.320 --> 13:43.520
Has anyone in there?

13:45.760 --> 13:47.680
Be careful, she might be hiding.

13:50.320 --> 14:00.320
That's perfectly safe, there isn't anyone.

14:20.320 --> 14:34.880
Okay, well, Markle, we're coming near the end of this series, aren't we?

14:34.880 --> 14:35.840
Yes, exactly.

14:35.840 --> 14:40.880
It's a short series, but what do you think happens or how do you think the series ends?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.880
What is really going on?

14:42.880 --> 14:46.400
A mystery here at English Pod, so we want you to hear from you.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.760
