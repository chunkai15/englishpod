Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
My name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
And I'm Erica.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
We're bringing you an advanced lesson today.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
That's right.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
An advanced lesson where we talk about investing in emerging markets.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Right.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
So it's kind of a business topic.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
It's kind of a world topic as well.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Yes.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
And it's pretty difficult.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Yeah, it is really hard.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Right.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
So if you're listening and you don't understand everything,

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
please don't get discouraged.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Don't worry about it.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
But worry about it because we're here to learn.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Yes, and we're here to help you.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Right.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Mm-hmm.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
So let's get started with this.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I'm really excited about this lesson.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Yeah, okay.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Well, Marco, maybe you can tell us a little bit.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
What is an emerging market?

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
An emerging market is a market that is starting to develop.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Okay.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
And it's growing rapidly.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
So you can maybe give some examples of emerging market.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Well, for example, China is an emerging market.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
In the last years, it's been growing rapidly.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
More and more people are moving to the middle class and have money to spend.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Right.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Exactly.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
So China is like a really great example of an emerging market.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
All right.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Well, with that, let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Sure, Johnny, how much do you need?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Five bucks?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Come on, Dad.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I need 30,000.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I want to get into the market.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
The inevitable recession.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
People stuffing their money in their mattresses.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I look at this as an opportunity.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
This is a chance for me to get a jumpstart on building my nest egg.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I don't know about that.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
With only uncertainty in the market right now,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
to be very unwise decision to invest.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I don't know if you're aware, son.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
But it has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
And there've already been half a million layoffs in the last few months.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
And we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
There's just too much instability.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I just wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
But look at this way.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Every challenge is an opportunity.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
In any way, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
There are emerging markets that promise great returns.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Look at China, for example.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
They have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of who have recently entered the middle class.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating opportunity.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Come on, son.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
You're looking at this too, know,ively.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability,

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Fine, then.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
If that's the way you feel, so be it.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
But you're losing out on a great opportunity here.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm going to hit up moms for the cash.

02:38.000 --> 02:53.000
Well, it sounds like the dad has missed out on a really big investment opportunity.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah, and his son is pretty smart.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Pretty smart, little boy.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Uh-huh.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Okay, so we have some great words that we want to look at here.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Why don't we start with the first one turmoil.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
turmoil.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
turmoil.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
So we have some great examples of how turmoil is used in different sentences.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
So let's listen.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Example one.

03:19.000 --> 03:29.000
With a civil war, a famine, and inflation, a country who's been in turmoil for 10 years.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Example two.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
There's been a lot of turmoil in my life recently.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Back moved to new city.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I've changed my job.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
And I broke up with my girlfriend.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Example three.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
The devaluation of the dollar calls a great deal of turmoil in the markets.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
So turmoil is a state of uncertainty of change

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
of difficult times.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
A little bit of chaos.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
So for example, when there's a lot of turmoil in the market, that means stock prices are changing drastically from day to day.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Right.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Or the economies in turmoil.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
There's a lot of problems going on.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Uncertainty.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Uncertainty.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Okay.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Good word.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
All right.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And we also saw something really interesting in the dialogue about a proposed stimulus package.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Proposed stimulus package.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
So a proposed stimulus package is something that's going on now.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Yes.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Let's break this phrase down.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
So we've got stimulus package.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
A stimulus package.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Something to stimulate the economy, right?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Right.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
So money from the government to get the economy moving.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
To get it moving.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
A stimulus package.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Proposed.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
It means that it hasn't been approved yet.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Right.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
It's suggested.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
It's an idea.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
So the proposed stimulus package for the US economy, for example,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
is $150 billion.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Right.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
That's $150 billion of American taxpayers money that the government wants to put into the economy to keep it moving.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
To keep it moving.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Right.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
So if it works or not, that's still a debate.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
It's a proposed stimulus package.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Let's move to our third phrase.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Aggregate demand.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Aggregate demand.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Aggregate demand.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Aggregate demand.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
So demand is pretty clear.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
But this word aggregate.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
What's that about?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Aggregate is like a combined added.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Right.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Aggregate demand.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
For example, in a country like China, where cities like in Shanghai or cities like Beijing.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
Where more and more people are accumulating wealth, the aggregate demand is increasing.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Right.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
The combined demand for consumer goods is growing.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Right.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
More people have more money, so they're spending more.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yes.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
You know, Marko, there's a ton of excellent language in this dialogue, isn't there?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
A lot of good stuff here.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
And we want to listen to the dialogue one more time.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
But before we do, we have three words for you that we want you to listen for.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Pay attention to these words.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Nest egg.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Nest egg.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Inevitable.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Inevitable.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And hit up.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Hit up.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
So from the context of the dialogue, try and see if you can figure out what they mean.

06:25.000 --> 06:36.000
After listening to it, we'll come back and explain it in a race.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Sure, Johnny, how much do you need?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Five bucks?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Come on, Dad.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
I need 30,000.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
I want to get into the market.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
People stuffing their money and their mattresses.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I look at this as an opportunity.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
This is a chance for me to get a jumpstart and building my nest egg.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I don't know about that, huh?

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
With all the uncertainty in the market right now, it'll be very unwise decision to invest.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
I don't know if you're aware, son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And there've already been half a million layoffs in the last few months.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
And we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
There's just too much instability.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I just wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Look at this way.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Every challenge is an opportunity.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
But anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
There are emerging markets that promise great returns.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Look at China, for example.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
They have 1.4 billion people.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Half a billion of who have recently entered the middle class.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating opportunity.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Ah, come on, son, you're looking at this too, notively.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Fine, then.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
If that's the way you feel, so be it.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
What you're losing out on a great opportunity here.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm going to hit up mom for the cash.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So the kid wants to invest because he wants to set up his nest egg.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
That's right.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
So basically he wants to get a bunch of cash together,

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
so that he can buy a house or get married or whatever.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
It's that money you need to start your life, right?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Start your life, your nest egg.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
It's kind of a weird way of referring to this money, right?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I guess it is kind of funny.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
And also the little boy talked about an inevitable recession.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Yes, inevitable.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
inevitable, basically means unavoidable.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Right.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
So this guy thinks that the recession is unavoidable.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
It's going to happen.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yes, inevitable.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
You know, this word inevitable.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
If you apply the root word,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
you can get a noun and adjective or an adverb, right?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Right.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
So we've got some examples where you can see this word in action.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Example one.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Jason knew he was going to get laid off,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
but he was trying to delay the inevitable.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Example two.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
As a new manager,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
it's inevitable that you're going to make mistakes.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Example three.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Inevitably, we all die at the end of our lives.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
So as you can see, the noun and adjective form are the same.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yes, inevitable.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Inevitably.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
When we use it as an adverb though, we add the LY to it.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Inevitably.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Inevitably.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Yes.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
So yeah, as you can see, we could use it in many different ways,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
depending on what we want to say.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Right.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Well, inevitably, we have to move on to our third words.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Hit up.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
So he says he's going to hit up mom for the cash.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Ask his mom.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah, hit up.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, this is kind of a slingy term, isn't it?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah, it's more informal.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
A lot more slingy.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
We wouldn't really use it with your boss with you.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
No, you're not going to go up to your boss and say,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Hey, I need to hit you up for some cash.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
No.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
So Markle, I think this word is only applying to money, right?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Well, you wouldn't go up to your boss and say,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Oh, I need to hit you up for some vacation time.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
No, it's typically used like for money.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
In this context.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Get him up.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
We've got some examples of the phrase, hit up.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Let's listen.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Example one.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm going to hit at the boss for a raise.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Example two.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
Are you trying to hit me up for money?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Example three.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I don't have any cash.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Have you tried hitting up Sophie?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
She's rich.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Okay, so this is our first advanced lesson.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
I hope you enjoyed it.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
It is a lot more challenging, I think.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yes.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Especially because it's set in a business context.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
So it makes it.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
So we have a lot of specific words and a lot of the technical vocabulary.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
That's right.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Markle, you're exactly right.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
And I think that our users are going to have a lot of questions about the language in this lesson.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
So I'd like to invite you guys to come onto our website at EnglishPod.com.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Exactly.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
But until then, it's goodbye.
