Hello English learners. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
And I'm Erica. And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson for all our elementary learners.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
You know what, Marco? I think this lesson is so useful. This is language that you can actually use every single day.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Exactly, every day. Exactly, because today we're going to be teaching you small talk.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
So what is small talk?

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
Well, small talk is small conversations that you would have with people that you don't know very well, but you still want to be polite.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Yes. Right. And you want to maybe just chat a little bit.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Okay. So let's listen to our dialogue. And as always, it's going to be a little bit fast, but don't worry about it.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Because welcome back in a minute and help you with some of the difficult language.

00:43.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi there Mr. Anderson. How are you in this fine morning?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Fine. Thank you.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it? I barely even got out of bed.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, it's pretty cold, all right.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Did you catch the news this morning? I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
No, I didn't hear about that.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Did you happen to watch the football game last night that Patriots scored in the last minute?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
No, I don't like football.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Oh, by the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party. She's really beautiful.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
She's my wife. Oh, here's my floor. Nice talking to you. Good bye.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Also, this is the 56th floor. We're on the 70th.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
That's okay. I'll take the stairs.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
Okay, I think this guy was a little bit annoying.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, Mr. Anderson really didn't want to talk to him, did he?

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, I think that was pretty obvious. He left the elevator in a hurry.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Okay, let's take a look at our language today in language takeaway.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Language takeaway.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
All right. What do we have today in language takeaway?

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Well, we've got four words and phrases and our first one is barely even.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Barely even.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Barely even.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
So how do we use barely even? It's a little bit difficult.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
It's really similar to like almost couldn't or almost nothing or almost can't.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
So we use it usually in a negative sense. For example, I could say,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
I was so busy today. I could barely even eat my lunch.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
Okay, so I can maybe say it was so dark. I could barely even see.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, okay.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah, or I'm so poor. I can barely even pay my rents.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Okay, good. Barely even.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
All right. Let's take a look at our next one.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Catch.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Catch.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Catch.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Did you catch the news?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
So by did you catch the news? You mean did you hear the news?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Exactly.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
So how else can we use this? Did you catch?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
A really common one is I didn't catch your name.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, I didn't hear your name.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I didn't hear your name.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah, and we can also say I didn't catch what he said.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I didn't catch what he said.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
So I didn't hear.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Okay, let's look at our next word.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
By the way.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
By the way.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
By the way.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
By the way.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Okay, so let's listen to some examples first of how we can use by the way.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
And then we'll come back and talk more about it.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Example one.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Are you going to be at the meeting today?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah, I'll be there.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh, by the way.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Did you hear what happened today?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Example two.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
By the way, I almost forgot to tell you Maggie Cole.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
Okay, so I see that when we say by the way, we're introducing a point after we've already talked about something.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Exactly, and maybe it's not even related to the topic we were talking about.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
No, it's a different topic.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Different topic, right?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It's like saying, oh, I almost forgot to tell you.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Exactly.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
So it's like, oh, Erica, don't forget we have a meeting today.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Oh, and by the way,

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I like your new haircut.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Thanks, Marco.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
All right, see?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
That's the way you would use by the way.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Okay, and the last word on language take away.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Take the stairs.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Take the stairs.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Take the stairs.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Take the stairs.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
So it doesn't mean you're going to take them somewhere.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
No, no, you're not taking them home with you.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
It means you're going to go up to stairs.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Hmm.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Okay, so take the stairs.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
A lot of people might say use the stairs or go up the stairs.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
But our English pod learners, they know, right?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
To use.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Take the stairs.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yep.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Take the stairs.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Okay, so now we're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

04:34.000 --> 04:47.000
And this will help you to catch these phrases a little bit better.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Morning.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Hi there, Mr. Anderson.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
How are you on this fine morning?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Fine.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Thank you.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I barely even got out of bed.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
It's pretty cold, all right?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Did you catch the news this morning?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
No.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I didn't hear about that.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
The Patriots scored in the last minute?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
No.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I don't like football.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh, oh, by the way, I saw you with your daughter at the open Christmas party.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
She's really beautiful.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
She's my wife.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Oh, here's my floor.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Nice talking to you.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Goodbye.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Oh, sir.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
This is the 56th floor.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Where on the 70th?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That's okay.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I'll take the stairs.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.000
Okay, so now let's take a look at ways to start up some small talk.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Let's put it together.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
So Marco, today we've got some great patterns or structures that you can use in your small

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
talk.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah, exactly.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
We saw some great patterns.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Let's start with the first one.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
It sure is cold this morning.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It sure is cold.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It sure is cold.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
It sure is cold.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay, so we can change it up a little bit and say,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
It sure is hot.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Mm-hmm.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Or it sure is late.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Okay.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
This sure is interesting.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Mm-hmm.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Or you could say, he sure is smart.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
So basically, you can change the adjective.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yes.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Cold, hot, smart, hard, difficult.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
And when you say, sure is, this is a great way of emphasizing that you

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
believe this adjective to be true.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Okay, sure is.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Now, what would be the answer to this?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Well, in the dialogue, Mr. Anderson said,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah, it's pretty cold all right.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
It's pretty cold all right.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
So again, using the examples we used before,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
we can say, oh, it's pretty hot all right.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Mm-hmm.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Or it's pretty late all right.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Or he's pretty smart all right.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Mm-hmm.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Or this is pretty interesting.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
All right.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
So it means you're agreeing with that person.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Exactly.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Okay, great.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
So Marco, these things, it sure is blank.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And yeah, it's blank all right.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
These can go together really well, can't they?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah, it's a question and answer format.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Mm-hmm.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
They go well.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Let's not be listened to some examples of how these two phrases work together.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Example one.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It sure is a nice day today.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah, it's nice, right?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Example two.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
The boss is sure late today.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah, it's late all right.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Example three.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
This class is really hard.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Yeah, it's hard all right.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Okay, so now let's take a look at our next word and putting it together.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Did you happen to?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Did you happen to?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Did you happen to?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Did you happen to?

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Did you happen to see Bob this morning?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I didn't happen to see Bob.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
So it means like, like, did you buy chance?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
By chance.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Did you buy chance?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Okay, another example would be,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
did you happen to go to that restaurant I recommended?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Hmm, or maybe, do you happen to have a pen?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Do you happen to know where the bathroom is?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah, that's a really useful one.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
That's a useful one.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
That's basically how you would use this structure.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Did you happen to?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Do you happen to?

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
So now let's listen to our dialogue for the third time.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
And I'm sure that you'll be able to understand everything.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Morning.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Hi there, Mr. Anderson.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
How are you in this fine morning?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Fine.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Thank you.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I barely even got out of bed.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
It's pretty cold, all right.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Did you catch the news this morning?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
No.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I didn't hear about that.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
The Patriots scored in the last minute?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
No.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I don't like football.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Oh, by the way.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
She's really beautiful.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
She's my wife.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh, here's my floor.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Nice talking to you.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Goodbye.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Also, this is the 56th floor.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
We're on the 70th.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
That's okay.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I'll take the stairs.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
All right, Marko, that was a really useful dialogue for daily life, wasn't it?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah, I think you can find a lot of useful language there.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
And that you can apply tomorrow.
