00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
Hello everyone, welcome back to another podcast here at EnglishPod, my name is Marco

00:07.920 --> 00:14.960
and I'm Erica and today we're looking at another one of our lessons for English of the past decades

00:14.960 --> 00:22.960
and this time it's the 1990s. Well you know the 1990s is a little easier for most of us to remember

00:22.960 --> 00:28.000
yeah I guess it's a little bit more recent we're gonna be looking at a lot of language that

00:28.080 --> 00:33.520
is still used today most of these words and phrases are still used today so they're going to be

00:33.520 --> 00:38.640
very useful and you're going to sound a lot more native. Mm-hmm a lot cooler as well huh?

00:38.640 --> 00:44.000
Right so before we get started with this lesson why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

00:45.120 --> 00:52.240
Very cablory preview. We have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue. Now the first one is

00:52.560 --> 01:00.320
a mall. A mall. M-A-L-L mall. All right so a mall is basically short for shopping mall.

01:01.120 --> 01:07.440
And a shopping mall is a big building with many stores inside. Right so it's like a shopping center

01:08.160 --> 01:17.520
and our last word for vocabulary preview is gang. The gang. The gang. Okay so a gang is a group of people

01:18.240 --> 01:22.800
yeah it's a group of people you can call your friends the gang. We're going to go out with the

01:22.800 --> 01:28.800
gang tonight. Yep. Now we sometimes hear this word to have and it has a negative meaning right?

01:28.800 --> 01:35.120
Right like street gangs. Yeah so people who are who fight and deal drugs and all that sort of stuff.

01:35.120 --> 01:40.480
Right so it can have a negative and a positive meaning so but it just depends on how you use it.

01:40.480 --> 01:45.520
Yeah but in the dialogue we'll hear it with the positive meaning. Right so that's all the words we have

01:45.520 --> 01:52.640
for vocabulary preview. Let's listen to this cool and hip dialogue from the 1990s and we'll come

01:52.640 --> 01:58.640
back later and explain some words.

01:58.640 --> 02:18.000
Hey for eyes. What's up man? How have you been? Not bad. Just went to the mall and picked up some

02:18.000 --> 02:26.480
junk. Check out my new adidas. Those are dope. You are going to be getting mad props from the gang man.

02:27.040 --> 02:34.240
Anyways have you seen Betty lately? Dude don't even go there. That girl started tripping

02:34.240 --> 02:41.040
because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day. I was like look you knew how I was before

02:41.040 --> 02:49.360
you got with you. That's right you're such a player man. Dude there's mad max. Let's go say hi.

02:50.240 --> 02:58.720
Max. What's up? Are you okay? You look like you just saw ghost. I got an F and English class.

02:58.720 --> 03:06.400
My life is over. Dude you're over it. You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

03:06.400 --> 03:14.400
Come on let's bounce. Where are we going? Oh crap. My dad doesn't go post to when he finds out about this.

03:14.880 --> 03:22.320
I'm going to open the can of what best on you if you don't come with me right now. Okay okay. G.

03:31.280 --> 03:37.520
Well it sounds like this guy's got some problems at school huh? Yeah he got an F on his paper but

03:37.520 --> 03:42.240
you always can count on your friends to try and cheer you up by doing something. Yeah but they

03:42.320 --> 03:48.320
use some really great phrases and vocabulary words so why don't we look at those now in language takeaway?

03:50.240 --> 03:57.040
Language takeaway. All right on language takeaway we're going to be looking at five words and

03:57.040 --> 04:02.800
well let's start with the first one. So the guy was talking about his really cool new shoes

04:02.800 --> 04:11.120
his new adidas right and his friend said those are dope. Dope. Dope. Okay so it's pretty easy to

04:11.120 --> 04:17.760
understand when something is dope. It's really awesome. It's cool. Yeah it's great. Right it's great so

04:17.760 --> 04:23.120
that's dope. And it's an adjective right? So his friends said those are dope and he said you're

04:23.120 --> 04:32.160
going to be getting mad props from the gang. Okay so mad props. We can divide this word into so let's

04:32.160 --> 04:38.080
take a look at the first part mad. So we understand that mad is angry right? Yeah but it can also

04:38.160 --> 04:45.520
mean a lot right? Amazing or really. So if I say you have mad skills you're really good at something

04:46.240 --> 04:52.880
or you can say she has a mad amount of shoes. All right so he's going to get mad props. Now props is

04:52.880 --> 05:00.080
like respect or compliments. Yeah so so his shoes are so cool that he's going to get a lot of respect

05:00.080 --> 05:06.560
or a lot of compliments from his friends. Exactly mad props. Mad props. So they started talking

05:06.560 --> 05:16.720
about girls and he mentioned that this girl started tripping tripping. So two tripping. Right as you

05:16.720 --> 05:22.880
notice it's tripping. It doesn't have the G at the end which isn't really grammatically correct but

05:22.880 --> 05:29.680
that's kind of the way it's pronounced. Yeah we would never say the G. Right so if somebody is tripping

05:29.680 --> 05:35.200
they're they're getting really upset. They're getting really angry. Right they're causing trouble.

05:35.520 --> 05:41.200
So why don't we listen to a couple of examples of how we could use tripping for different situations?

05:42.320 --> 05:48.480
Example one. Leanne was tripping because I got dirt on her car.

05:50.880 --> 05:56.160
Example two. Even though I apologize for calling her fat,

05:56.240 --> 06:07.360
Jenny was tripping all night. Example three. He sent me 43 text messages and call me about 20 times.

06:07.360 --> 06:12.800
That guy is tripping over me. Okay so that's pretty clear.

06:12.800 --> 06:20.400
I'm tripping. All right now moving on to our next word. They wanted to go somewhere and he said

06:20.400 --> 06:27.280
come on let's bounce. Let's bounce. Let's bounce. I'm gonna bounce. Now a bounce basically means

06:27.920 --> 06:33.520
it's leave. Yeah let's get out of here. But we might be more familiar with this this word as in like

06:33.520 --> 06:39.440
a ball right. A ball bounces off the floor. Exactly. So I guess it's kind of the same you kind of

06:39.440 --> 06:45.760
bounce off the floor and leave that place. Yeah let's bounce. Okay so for a final word now this guy

06:45.840 --> 06:52.400
who got a bad mark on his paper he was nervous about what his dad would say right? Right?

06:52.400 --> 07:00.080
Because his dad was going to go postal. He said my dad is gonna go postal. To go postal.

07:00.080 --> 07:06.240
Now if you go postal it means you go crazy. Yeah you really freak out. You go you get very angry.

07:06.240 --> 07:12.720
Yeah like really angry. This word comes from the 90s because during a time it was very common

07:12.720 --> 07:18.560
in the United States that postal workers melman were going a little bit crazy and you know they

07:18.560 --> 07:25.040
started shooting people and delivering some strange packages. Well I guess so people who work in

07:25.040 --> 07:29.840
the post office maybe don't have the most exciting jobs and that drive them a little crazy.

07:29.840 --> 07:35.440
Exactly that's what and but now they have a term named after them. All right so why don't we

07:35.440 --> 07:40.880
listen to our dialogue for the second time? We're gonna slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back.

07:43.600 --> 07:54.800
Hey for eyes. What's up man? How have you been? Not bad. Just went to the mall and picked up some

07:54.800 --> 08:02.720
junk. Check out my new adidas. Those are dope. You are going to be getting mad props from the

08:02.720 --> 08:10.720
gang man. Anyways have you seen Betty lately dude don't even go there. That girl started

08:10.800 --> 08:16.960
tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day. I was like look you knew

08:16.960 --> 08:25.280
how I was before you got with me. That's right you are such a player man dude there's mad max.

08:25.280 --> 08:33.120
Let's go say hi. Max was ah are you okay? You look like you just saw ghost.

08:34.080 --> 08:42.320
I got an effort in this class my life is over. Dude you're over it. You need to lay off the

08:42.320 --> 08:50.480
books for a while and have some fun. Come on let's bounce. Where are we going? Oh crap my dad's

08:50.480 --> 08:57.040
gonna go post when he finds out about this. I'm gonna open the can of what best on you if you don't

08:57.040 --> 09:07.280
come with me right now. Okay okay geez. Okay so I think that was a little easier to

09:07.280 --> 09:13.120
understand you know we've got a lot of pretty strange words and phrases some interesting slang.

09:13.120 --> 09:17.840
Yeah and I want to take a look at this slang now so let's get started with fluency builder.

09:18.960 --> 09:24.320
Fluency builder. Okay so the guy with the new shoes he asked his friends have you seen

09:24.400 --> 09:31.120
Betty lately right. Right and the his friend replied don't even go there. Right he was like dude

09:31.120 --> 09:36.400
don't even go there. Don't even go there. So what does he mean when he says don't even go there.

09:36.400 --> 09:41.600
He means don't talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. Right don't even touch that subject.

09:41.600 --> 09:47.040
Don't even mention it. Right so if somebody wants to talk about a topic that you think is sensitive

09:47.040 --> 09:51.200
or you don't want to talk about us to say hey don't don't even go there. So Marko what do you think

09:51.200 --> 09:57.040
about the new tax law? Don't even go there. I don't even want to talk about politics. Okay so I

09:57.040 --> 10:03.360
think that's that's a really actually quite helpful phrase to avoid talking about an uncomfortable

10:03.360 --> 10:08.720
subject. Right so he said don't even go there and he started talking about the girl and she was

10:08.720 --> 10:15.680
tripping and then he said something interesting. He said I was like look you knew how I was before

10:15.840 --> 10:23.440
you got with me. Yeah I really like this phrase. Now I want to focus on the first part. I was like

10:23.440 --> 10:30.080
I was like I was like. Now you might hear a lot of native English speakers use these three words

10:30.080 --> 10:39.120
before they start telling you what they said. So it's like saying I said or I told him. Yep so

10:39.200 --> 10:45.600
this actually is really common especially with people under the age of 30. So why don't we

10:45.600 --> 10:53.920
hear a few more examples of how it's used now? Example one. This guy caused a car accident I was like

10:53.920 --> 11:04.160
you idiot you can kill people by driving like that. Example two. And then I was like I hate you and she

11:04.240 --> 11:12.640
was all like I hate you more. Example three. I told the teacher that I didn't finish my homework

11:12.640 --> 11:20.000
and he was like I'll see you after school. So if you're telling a story or you're maybe talking

11:20.000 --> 11:25.280
to somebody and you want to explain what you said you can say I was like hey what are you doing

11:25.280 --> 11:30.720
and she was like what so you can have an entire dialogue based with I was like she was like

11:30.800 --> 11:37.360
we were like huh okay so I was like it's super super useful. So now our next word now they saw

11:37.360 --> 11:44.960
their friend who got the bad marking in school and the guy said dude get over it. Get over it.

11:44.960 --> 11:52.720
Get over it. So if somebody tells you to get over it stop worrying about it. Okay or stop thinking

11:52.720 --> 11:58.240
about it. All right so if somebody is sad because maybe his girlfriend broke up with him you would

11:59.200 --> 12:04.640
get over it. Yeah stop thinking about that it go it's in the past. Yeah and you you commonly use this

12:04.640 --> 12:11.360
for when somebody is upset about a small thing something they shouldn't worry about. Get over it.

12:11.360 --> 12:16.480
Yeah now what are we going to our final word at the end of the dialogue they said I'm going to open

12:16.480 --> 12:23.760
a can of webass. Okay so to open a can of webass on somebody to open a can of webass.

12:23.760 --> 12:28.960
So again let's break this down before we explain it. Okay I think we have to take one step back here.

12:29.600 --> 12:35.680
To whoop someone's ass is to beat them up right. To to punch them and hurt them.

12:35.680 --> 12:42.080
Right so to whoop somebody's ass. So if I open a can of webass what does that mean? It means you're

12:42.080 --> 12:48.000
going to beat them up. So it's just a funny very informal way of saying like in this can I'm going

12:48.000 --> 12:52.080
to open it and I'm going to start hitting you or something like that. Some sort of small man is going

12:52.080 --> 12:57.360
to jump out of the can and start hitting you. Exactly but it's never literal it's not like

12:57.360 --> 13:02.560
you're actually going to beat somebody up it's just kind of like kind of joke. Yeah it's an empty threat.

13:02.560 --> 13:07.760
Yeah all right so some really interesting words and phrases in this dialogue I think we should

13:07.760 --> 13:13.040
listen to it for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this great

13:13.280 --> 13:17.280
decade.

13:29.120 --> 13:37.600
Hey for eyes what's up man how have you been? Not bad just went to the mall and picked up some

13:38.240 --> 13:46.080
check out my new adidas. Those are dope. You are going to be getting mad drops from the gang man.

13:46.720 --> 13:54.080
Anyways have you seen Betty lately dude don't even go there. That girl started tripping because

13:54.080 --> 14:01.200
I went to the movies with Veronica the other day. I was like look you knew how I was before you got

14:02.080 --> 14:08.960
that's right you are such a player man dude there's mad max let's go say hi

14:11.040 --> 14:19.920
max was ah are you okay you look like you just saw ghost. I got an epic English class my life is over

14:19.920 --> 14:28.560
dude you're over it you need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun come on let's bounce

14:28.640 --> 14:35.520
where are we going. Oh crap my dad's gonna go post when he finds out about this. I'm gonna open

14:35.520 --> 14:41.920
the can of what best on you if you don't come with me right now okay okay G.

14:51.600 --> 14:57.280
Well Marco in the dialogue I heard one of the guys say what's up but he said it in a really

14:57.280 --> 15:05.120
strange way didn't he yeah exactly he said what's up okay so what what's up with that so in the

15:05.120 --> 15:11.040
90s it was popular instead of saying what's up you would just kind of double BS and just say what's up

15:11.040 --> 15:17.760
and then it became very famous with a TV commercial for a certain beer and actually I remember

15:17.760 --> 15:24.240
this commercial during the the Super Bowl they had this big commercial where everyone was saying what's

15:24.240 --> 15:29.120
up in this really strange way right it's still used today informally between friends you'll go

15:29.120 --> 15:34.800
hey hey what's up and what's up yeah so you'll use it yeah so that commercial made it actually quite

15:34.800 --> 15:40.800
cool and in famous to talk like that actually in Spanish pod they have a show called getbasa which is

15:40.800 --> 15:47.040
like the translation of what's up and they start each show with like saying getbasa but it's exactly

15:47.040 --> 15:53.520
the same so maybe it will become popular in Spanish maybe but I guess only uh time will tell yeah that's

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
all right so really cool stuff and as we heard typical music from the 90s and another interesting

16:00.000 --> 16:06.160
thing was the nicknames for eyes Mad Max very popular among young kids hmm so remember if you

16:06.160 --> 16:11.440
