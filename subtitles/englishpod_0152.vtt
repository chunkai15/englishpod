00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco and my name is Katherine.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
So as usually we've got a great dialogue for you today and before we get going,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
I should mention what the topic is. So Marco take it away.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
We are actually having a small fight at the office.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Somebody or a coworker is annoying us. So you know, sometimes coworkers,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
you see them every day, they're doing something that's maybe getting on your nerves.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
And you practically live together because you're with each other for eight, nine,

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
ten hours every day. Exactly. So that's what we're going to be looking at.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Today some language related to this topic. So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Hey Mary, can you cut that out?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Cut what out? I'm not doing anything.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
The tapping of your pen on your desk. It's driving me crazy.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Fine. By the way, would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup?

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't slurp my coffee. And plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
You've got to be kidding me. You're complaining about me talking on the phone.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
When you go out for a cigarette break, ten times a day to shoot the breeze.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
But it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Fine. Let's call it truce. I'll try to be more considerate and keep the noise down.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, I'll try to do the same. So I was wondering,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
do you want to go out to dinner Friday night?

01:42.000 --> 01:52.000
All right, we're back. So yeah, I think this is a common situation, right?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
So common, this might even be based on our own lives.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
It is. You may not know, but Catherine, I get into fights all the time.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
All the time. Not really.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
All right. So I think there was some interesting words here, but mostly phrases.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
So let's start with the words first on language takeaway.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
All right. So the first word as you might have guessed has to do with eating and drinking.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
This is called slurping. And it's some lurp to slurps.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
So the noun, the thing is slurping. And it's very common with people who eat their food quickly.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Like soup. Yeah, soup or, you know, or when they're eating soup noodles.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
Or sometimes when you have a drink and you're drinking it through a straw towards the end,

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
you're just like trying to get the very last part at the bottom. So yeah, the straw slurps.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah, so slurping. Some people really can't stand it. And sometimes you don't even notice that you're doing it.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
No, absolutely not. All right. So apart from slurping, what else do we have?

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
We've got a great word here, accumulated. So a lot of accumulated anger.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
The word is a verb to accumulate. And what does that mean?

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Means to kind of grow or to become more and more.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
All right. So you're like saving it.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Or even it's like building up. You know, we say this will oftentimes in Chicago where it snows a lot in the winter

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
that there's a foot of snow accumulated on the ground. That means there's a lot of snow.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
And every time it snows, it keeps getting bigger.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah. So to accumulate.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
So accumulated anger. Your anger is getting bigger and bigger.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Because you never tell anyone about your anger. So it keeps building and it keeps piling up.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
All right. Well, towards the end, they said, well, let's call it truce. So they want to call it truce.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
All right. A truce is another word for a piece. And so this is a way that you can stop fighting.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
And say that you and I have been fighting for a long time. We may not come to a deal.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
But we'll say truce from now on. We just won't fight.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
We won't fight about it. Okay.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Brothers and sisters often call truses.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
And well, if you're calling a truce, you're trying to be more considerate.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Okay. Consider it like you're saying is a way to be or a way to act and consider it.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Often has to do with how you act towards other people.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
So it's being nice to other people or thinking about other people's feelings before yourself.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
All right. So if you're considerate, then you may be more polite.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
You think about the other person's feelings before you do anything.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
It's like, well, you just say nice little things like, please, and thank you. And I'm sorry.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
And these things are all ways of being considerate.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Very good. All right. So four great words on language takeaway.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Why don't we move on now to fluency builder?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Fluency builder.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
All right. So as we mentioned, this dialogue is very, very rich in a lot of different phrases.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
So let's start with a couple of them.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
The very first one and the title of the lesson, cut it out. Cut that out.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Right. So you're not actually saying to cut something with scissors or something?

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
No. This is, it's a way of saying, can you stop that?

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Stop it. Stop doing that. Stop it. Quit it.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Okay. Cut that out. Cut it out.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
So if someone's doing something that's really annoying to you, it's not very nice to say,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
but you can say, hey, cut that out.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Or if someone's doing something mean to someone like my brother used to hit me,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
my mom would say, Peter, cut that out.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
All right. So it is a good mom phrase as well.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
All right. Moving on to our next phrase,

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
the guy said that the tapping on the desk was driving him crazy.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
It's driving me crazy.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
All right. To drive someone crazy means to make someone just feel like they're going nuts.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
Or, you know, just it makes you kind of angry or frustrated or tense.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
But it can also be used like in in a romantic sense, right? That girl drives me crazy.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
It means like he can't even think about anything else.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
All right. So in this case, what drives you crazy?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
When I'll tell you what drives me crazy,

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
when people clip their fingernails and toenails at the office.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Can't believe, well, it drives me crazy like, for example,

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
when somebody or my brother leaves his clothes lying on the floor in the living room.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
That's annoying too. Yeah. So that drives me crazy.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
All right. So moving on to our third phrase,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
this is a pretty big one, but take it as a hold.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
You've got to be kidding me.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
All right. So this is, as you've said, a fixed phrase,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
these words usually go together and it is a perfect example of sarcasm.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
So it's a way, the way you say it is very important.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
So I could say, you've got to be kidding me.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
What's a good, what's a good situation for this?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Maybe I get to the airport and I'm running late,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
and I'm really happy that I get there on time.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
And then I see the flight is delayed seven hours.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Exactly.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
You've got to be kidding me.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Right. So it's a way of saying I can't believe it,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
or seriously, this isn't what's happening.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
What bad luck.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
All right. So it is sarcastic phrase, but use it as a whole.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Usually you don't change the subject.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
You don't say you've got to be kidding him.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
No, it's always this. You've got to be kidding me.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
All right.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
All right. You've got to be kidding me.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
See, different meanings with different inflections.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Different inflections. Very good.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
What's our next phrase?

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
Our next phrase is a good one because it doesn't mean what it sounds like.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Okay. So to shoot the breeze,

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
all right.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Shoot means like you can shoot a gun,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
and breeze is like the wind,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
but here to shoot the breeze is to have a nice little conversation,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
just to talk about nothing.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Okay. So I'm not really doing anything just talk a little bit.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Right. So if we think about this in the context of this sentence,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
you know, you go out for your cigarette break 10 times a day

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
to shoot the breeze.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
So this means you go outside and you just talk about nothing and whatever,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and it's almost like you're wasting time just talking.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Okay. So shooting the breeze,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
you can say, oh, we were just shooting the breeze.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Just having a nice little conversation, nothing important.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Okay.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
And our last phrase for today,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
for give and forget.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Let's forgive and forget.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Let's forgive and forget.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
This is these words again, like the last phrases,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
go together,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
forgive and forget.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
So I could say this to you, Mark,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I say, I know you've been fighting with your brother for 10 years.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I say,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
finally, just forgive and forget.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I mean, just put everything behind you

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
and try and start again.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Okay. Let it go.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Forgive the person.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Forget about it.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Move on.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Okay.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Forgive and forget.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Very good.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
So very interesting phrases.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I think they're very useful.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And this is very colloquial English, right?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Absolutely.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
This is stuff that you're going to hear all the time,

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
but maybe not all together,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
but at the same time,

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
definitely though,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
very helpful for interacting with foreign friends and colleagues.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Very good.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the last time

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
and we'll be right back.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Cut what out?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I'm not doing anything.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
The tapping of your pen on your desk.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
It's driving me crazy.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Fine.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
By the way, would you mind not serving your coffee every time you have a cup?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I don't slurp my coffee.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
And plus, how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
You've got to be kidding me.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
You're complaining about your coffee.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
You've got to be kidding me.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
You're complaining about me talking on the phone

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
when you go out for a cigarette break

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
ten times a day to shoot the breeze.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
from working in these conditions.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
But it's probably not a good idea to keep it up.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Fine.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Let's call it truce.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I'll try to be more considerate

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
and keep the noise down.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah, I'll try to do the same.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So, I was wondering,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
do you want to go out to dinner Friday night?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
So, do you ever see the TV show for house when you were a kid?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I did.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I did.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
It was a puppet.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
With the all-saint winds and all those, right?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah, and Bob Sagitt.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
So, there was an uncle on the show, Uncle Joey.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
And he always used to say, cut it out.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And he had like hand motions for it.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And so, cut it out as a way to say,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
kind of stop it.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Quit it.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
You're killing me.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's like he was saying, too funny.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Right.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
And so, whenever I hear this phrase,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I always think of that early 90s.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Very early 90s.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Well, this whole situation with the office as well.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
I think there was a TV show called The Office, right?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah, there was the British office

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
and then there was an American version.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
And it's also something about office life

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
and how colleagues get on each other's nerves

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
and they play pranks on each other and everyone's kind of weird.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
And everyone drives everyone else crazy.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Exactly.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
No, it's funny because once you start working in an office full-time,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I mean, everyone's maybe had a little bit of office experience,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
but when it's full-time, you spend more time with your colleagues

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
than you do with your family.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
It's really strange.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Amazing.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
What makes you crazy?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
What drives you crazy?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
And what stuff does it matter?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So, this is an interesting topic.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
We really want to hear from you guys.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Many of you probably work at an office, so tell us,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
so come and tell us what drives you crazy,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
or maybe what colleague is driving you mad.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
You don't have to use names.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
You can just use nicknames if you want.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Right.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
So, we'll be waiting for you at EnglishPod.com.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Leave questions in comments.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
And we'll see you guys next time.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yep.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Bye, everyone.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Thank you.
