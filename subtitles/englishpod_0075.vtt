00:00.000 --> 00:11.600
Hello, everyone. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we're going to be going to one of the least favorite places of many many people

00:11.600 --> 00:20.800
So it must be the dentists exactly that place where you have to go every six months, but you probably don't go

00:20.800 --> 00:23.600
You probably don't I know I don't go every six months

00:24.160 --> 00:29.680
So yeah, we're going to be going to the dentist and of course, we're going to be looking at a lot of great vocabulary

00:29.680 --> 00:37.120
related to teeth and all that crazy stuff dentists do. Yes, and we'll also learn some really interesting phrases

00:37.680 --> 00:40.960
So Marco, let's get started with our vocabulary preview

00:42.320 --> 00:48.560
Very vocabulary preview. Okay, I'm vocabulary preview today. We have two words. Let's take a look at the first one

00:49.200 --> 00:56.000
tooth ache tooth ache tooth ache tooth ache. Okay, so we've seen before this

00:56.080 --> 01:02.160
This ending ache right right it means it hurts exactly so again a tooth ache would be

01:02.800 --> 01:09.120
Herding tooth hurting tooth. Yes, we can also say stomach ache headache. Yeah pretty much everything can

01:09.680 --> 01:16.880
ache ache. Okay, so our next word x-ray x-ray x-ray x-ray x

01:17.600 --> 01:24.880
hyphen are a y. Okay, pretty easy word. So when you go to the doctor many times you'll get an x-ray

01:25.360 --> 01:35.040
It is a picture of your bones right so that's an x-ray. All right, well we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue

01:35.040 --> 01:39.040
So why don't we listen as Gary visits his dentist

01:49.920 --> 01:53.920
Hey Gary, great to see you again

01:54.960 --> 01:56.960
Please have a seat

01:57.440 --> 02:01.680
So tell me what seems to be the problem

02:03.280 --> 02:08.960
Thanks Doc. I've got a really bad tooth ache. I can't eat anything and look my face is all swollen

02:09.760 --> 02:15.440
I think it might be my wisdom teeth. Well, let's have a look

02:16.320 --> 02:18.320
Open wide

02:25.440 --> 02:27.440
Hmm

02:27.440 --> 02:29.440
This doesn't look good

02:30.080 --> 02:35.280
Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose

02:35.280 --> 02:43.520
So we'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse and the crown probably needs to be refitted

02:44.400 --> 02:47.360
I'm going to order some x-ray

02:48.720 --> 02:52.240
Is it gonna hurt? No, not at all

02:53.200 --> 02:55.840
Just lay back and relax

03:13.840 --> 03:15.840
Okay, spit

03:15.920 --> 03:22.160
Okay, that always happens the dentist says no. It's not gonna hurt. Don't worry about it

03:22.160 --> 03:24.800
But it always hurts much more than he says

03:25.440 --> 03:32.640
Exactly, so in this dialogue we saw some interesting words when the dentist was describing what problems Gary had

03:32.640 --> 03:36.000
Yes, so why don't we look at those now in language takeaway

03:38.080 --> 03:40.080
Language takeaway

03:40.800 --> 03:45.760
All right, let's take a look at our first word. So Gary said that his face was

03:45.920 --> 03:54.720
All swollen swollen swollen swollen swollen so swollen is an adjective, right Marco? Right

03:55.040 --> 04:02.560
So his face is or was swollen. It was bigger. Yeah, his face was bigger than normal

04:02.560 --> 04:06.640
Yes, often when you hurt yourself that part of your body becomes

04:07.280 --> 04:14.720
Swollen right, so you have to put some ice on it usually and then the swelling will go down and that's the noun the swelling

04:14.800 --> 04:21.040
Right the swelling and well the verb to swell all right three words for the price of wine

04:21.200 --> 04:26.960
So let's listen to some examples of how we would use the swelling swollen and to swell

04:28.240 --> 04:30.240
Example one

04:31.280 --> 04:34.080
My nose is swollen. It's the size of a football

04:36.560 --> 04:38.560
Example two

04:39.040 --> 04:41.440
Put some ice on your foot and the swelling will go down

04:44.320 --> 04:46.320
Example three I

04:47.040 --> 04:49.920
Got bitten by a spider in my hand is swelling up

04:52.400 --> 04:59.360
All right, so Gary's face was swollen and he thought that it was his wisdom teeth wisdom teeth

04:59.360 --> 05:06.800
Wisdom teeth. Okay, so this is interesting. Wisdom is like wise yet knowledge. Yeah, so these teeth

05:06.880 --> 05:12.400
They're not knowledgeable, but they're called wisdom teeth. They're the teeth that grow last in your mouth, right?

05:12.400 --> 05:19.120
Right, they are the last teeth at the very end of your mouth. Yes, and usually you get them when you're about 20

05:20.080 --> 05:22.720
And since they come out at this age

05:23.280 --> 05:29.680
Sometimes they interfere or they hurt a little bit, so you have to get them taken out. Yes, all right wisdom teeth

05:30.160 --> 05:35.680
Wisdom teeth. Okay, now for our next word and something that we all got as children

05:36.160 --> 05:43.120
Cavity cavity a cavity a cavity a cavity. It's a hole in your tooth a hole in your tooth and it's caused by

05:43.760 --> 05:48.880
Too much sugar or not brushing your teeth enough. Yeah, so that's why

05:49.520 --> 05:54.960
Everyone had it. I think as children cavities. I never had a cavity. Really. Yeah. Wow, didn't have much sugar

05:55.200 --> 05:59.360
I guess I was a bit of a health nut when I was a kid. No, I wasn't my mom was

06:00.320 --> 06:06.400
No, I guess not all right, but enough about my eating habits. Let's talk about our next word

06:07.120 --> 06:09.440
Crown crown a crown

06:10.160 --> 06:16.800
So a crown. This is interesting. We're not talking kings and greed. Right. That's the first thing that comes to mind, right?

06:17.360 --> 06:24.800
No, a crown is actually the visible part of your teeth. Okay, so there's one part of your tooth that's inside that you can't see, right?

06:24.880 --> 06:31.840
That's called the root. Yes, so when he said your crown is loose. What's he talking really about the actual tooth?

06:32.000 --> 06:39.840
So sometimes people will lose a tooth or have a really bad cavity. So the dentist needs to make a new crown or a new

06:39.840 --> 06:48.800
Visible part of the tooth for you. So sometimes it'll be made of gold. Yeah, or porcelain or saline. Yeah, exactly. So a crown.

06:48.800 --> 06:55.520
It's like a really really really big filling. Mm-hmm. I got crowned. So his crown needed to be refitted or

06:56.000 --> 07:05.360
Put back into place. Yes, and we're final word a filling filling a filling a filling. So I just said this word previously

07:05.920 --> 07:12.160
Now when you have a cavity, you need to fill it in. Right. You need to fill it with something. Yes

07:12.320 --> 07:21.120
Usually some sort of paste and it gets really hard and it's just like your tooth exactly. So then it covers up this cavity filling a filling

07:21.120 --> 07:26.000
I have many feelings. I wasn't very healthy as a kid. All right, not a good tooth pressure

07:27.440 --> 07:33.520
Exactly, so why don't we listen to this dialogue again and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about some of the

07:33.520 --> 07:35.520
interesting phrases that the doctor used

07:39.760 --> 07:41.760
Hey, Gary

07:41.920 --> 07:43.920
Great to see you again

07:44.720 --> 07:46.720
Please have a seat

07:47.280 --> 07:51.600
So tell me what seems to be the problem

07:53.040 --> 07:58.800
Things doc, I've got a really bad toothache. I can't eat anything and look my face is also all in

07:59.520 --> 08:05.360
I think it might be my wisdom teeth. Well, let's have a look

08:06.240 --> 08:08.240
open wide

08:08.960 --> 08:10.960
Oh

08:11.520 --> 08:13.280
This doesn't look good

08:14.320 --> 08:19.440
Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose

08:20.320 --> 08:27.760
We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse and the crown probably needs to be refitted

08:28.640 --> 08:31.680
I'm gonna order some x-rays

08:32.960 --> 08:36.320
Is it gonna hurt? No, not at all

08:36.400 --> 08:40.400
Oh, just lay back and relax

08:53.840 --> 08:55.840
Okay, spit

08:57.440 --> 09:02.080
Well the dentist used three really interesting phrases and I want to look at the first one

09:02.400 --> 09:09.440
What seems to be the problem? What seems to be the problem? Okay, very easy

09:09.840 --> 09:16.320
little sentence to ask somebody what's wrong? Exactly, right? And I mean these are small easy words

09:16.320 --> 09:21.760
But when you put them together, they sound really natural and and really fluent

09:22.800 --> 09:26.640
So if you ask somebody what seems to be the problem is very polite

09:27.280 --> 09:30.800
And it's a very good way of asking what's wrong? Yes, all right

09:30.960 --> 09:34.320
Our next phrase also made up of simple words

09:35.120 --> 09:44.880
Let's have a look. Let's have a look. Let's have a look. So this is a phrase that maybe you're mechanic or your dentist or your doctor will say or anyone right

09:44.880 --> 09:48.400
Let's have a look. Let's look at it and see what the problem is

09:49.440 --> 09:53.200
Okay, let's have a look. Okay, and our final phrase

09:54.240 --> 09:56.240
It doesn't look good

09:56.320 --> 10:04.320
It doesn't look good. It doesn't look good. So I can use this phrase for an object, right? Yeah, like a this house doesn't look good

10:04.560 --> 10:10.800
Yes, but here it's used a little bit differently. So why don't we listen to some examples to help us understand the meaning

10:12.640 --> 10:14.640
Example one

10:16.240 --> 10:19.280
John told me it doesn't look good for me. I probably won't get the job

10:22.880 --> 10:24.880
Example two

10:25.760 --> 10:28.880
It doesn't look good for Michael Jackson. He's in a lot of debt

10:31.760 --> 10:33.760
Example three

10:35.360 --> 10:37.520
You know the economy doesn't look very good

10:40.160 --> 10:45.360
Okay, so in the examples we can see that they are using it for the situation. Yeah, it looks maybe

10:46.000 --> 10:50.560
problematic. Yeah, so when you say it doesn't look good you basically mean

10:51.280 --> 10:57.280
There are going to be problems. All right, it doesn't look good. Yeah, okay

10:57.600 --> 11:01.520
So great phrases great words. Let's listen to our

11:02.000 --> 11:06.240
Gary at the dentist one more time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more

11:13.680 --> 11:15.680
Hey, Gary

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Great to see you again

11:18.640 --> 11:20.640
Please have a seat

11:21.200 --> 11:25.440
So tell me what seems to be the problem

11:27.040 --> 11:32.720
Big stock I've got a really meant to think I can't eat anything and look my faces all swollen

11:33.520 --> 11:41.200
I think it might be my wisdom teeth. Well, let's have a look open wide

11:48.960 --> 11:50.960
Hmm

11:50.960 --> 11:52.960
This doesn't look good

11:53.840 --> 11:58.960
Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose

11:58.960 --> 12:07.280
So we'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse and the crown probably needs to be refitted

12:08.160 --> 12:10.960
I'm going to order some x-rays

12:12.480 --> 12:15.920
Is it gonna hurt? No, not at all

12:16.880 --> 12:19.520
Just lay back and relax

12:37.680 --> 12:39.680
Okay, spit

12:39.920 --> 12:51.360
Well, Marco speaking of dentists have you ever had an experience like this where you've spat out a tooth at the dentist?

12:52.320 --> 12:55.360
Well, nothing so serious as this but

12:56.080 --> 13:00.320
Actually recently when I was in Cambodia. All right, you called us to in Cambodia. Yeah

13:01.520 --> 13:08.240
Well, our taxi driver offered us to have some local food and he said well, we're gonna have dog

13:08.880 --> 13:10.880
So that's interesting

13:11.520 --> 13:16.240
Actually, it wasn't that bad. It was pretty good, but you know if you get around the fact that it's a dog

13:16.400 --> 13:21.280
So what does this have to do with your teeth? I was eating it and I bit a bone that was hidden

13:21.600 --> 13:26.160
Okay, and I chipped my tooth. So you broke part of your tooth. Yeah, like half of it

13:26.640 --> 13:33.120
Which I had already chipped before so I had to go to the dentist and so the dentist created a new crown with

13:33.120 --> 13:39.120
Not with gold or porcelain and actually with a paste. Oh, and then it becomes hard and it just looks normal

13:39.120 --> 13:45.360
It doesn't even look like I have a fake crown, so to say, but dentists can be really expensive

13:45.360 --> 13:47.360
So how much did this cost?

13:47.520 --> 13:51.200
Well, this was for the bargain price of

13:51.600 --> 13:52.640
$10

13:52.640 --> 13:53.600
$10

13:53.600 --> 13:54.400
$10

13:54.400 --> 13:59.760
That's how much it cost. So we should all go to Cambodia for dentistry. Yeah, because actually he was pretty good

14:00.000 --> 14:04.400
He looked really young though. I was kind of scared because when he walked in he looked like he was 19

14:04.880 --> 14:08.800
But I asked him his age and he was like 30. Okay. Well, you're very trusting

14:09.600 --> 14:13.600
Yeah, so I imagine that you guys maybe have some dental experiences

14:13.600 --> 14:18.720
