00:00.000 --> 00:10.600
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we're gonna be bringing you another great sports lesson

00:10.600 --> 00:15.400
Yes, this one is for all our hockey fans. I know we have a lot of listeners from Russia

00:15.400 --> 00:21.800
So this is a very popular sport in Russia Czech Republic. Yes, so Canada and Canada, right?

00:21.800 --> 00:25.000
Very very popular in Canada. It's our national game

00:25.000 --> 00:30.160
Well, I guess because you guys have so much ice. I know there's nothing else to do

00:30.160 --> 00:32.160
It's skiing and hockey

00:32.160 --> 00:37.200
All right, so it's gonna be a really fun lesson. We're gonna have a lot of great vocabularies

00:37.200 --> 00:41.560
So before we start in the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabularie preview

00:42.400 --> 00:44.400
Very vocabulary preview

00:44.880 --> 00:49.600
Well, we have three words for you now. The first one really simple

00:49.600 --> 00:58.480
puck pup puck pup you ck so it's almost like duck but with the pee yes

00:58.480 --> 01:03.960
And this is actually kind of like the ball that you use in hockey, but it's not a ball

01:03.960 --> 01:07.760
But it's not a ball. It's flat. It's flat and round and round

01:08.380 --> 01:12.680
so it looks like a disc kind of like a mini-freeze b. Yes, and

01:13.800 --> 01:17.460
This is what the players do this is what they they chase this around

01:17.460 --> 01:23.900
Yeah, so in basketball you have a ball and talk you have a ball in hockey. You have a puck. Yep. Okay, our next word

01:24.780 --> 01:28.820
Key game a key game a key game a key game

01:29.420 --> 01:37.700
So this word key important it means important really important really important. Yeah, so I can say a key game is a really important game

01:37.820 --> 01:38.820
Exactly

01:38.820 --> 01:45.820
You could also maybe say a key player key player is a really important player or even a key goal

01:46.060 --> 01:50.060
A key goal. Okay, so let's take a look at our last word now

01:50.780 --> 01:52.780
Finals finals

01:53.180 --> 02:01.060
Final the finals so the finals are the last games. That's right and the winner of the finals

02:01.420 --> 02:06.580
wins the championship. Okay, for example in the world cup in soccer

02:07.020 --> 02:10.500
There's only one game played in the finals. So after everyone gets eliminated

02:10.500 --> 02:14.060
There's one game where the winner is the champion. Yes, okay

02:14.340 --> 02:20.260
So now we're ready to listen to our dialogue and it's gonna be a little bit faster than usual

02:20.980 --> 02:24.660
Because it's a sports commentator and it's excited and it's exciting

02:24.660 --> 02:29.940
There's a lot of action. So don't worry about it. Listen to it and then we'll come back and talk about some of the vocabulary

02:44.060 --> 02:58.660
Hello everyone. I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland. Howdy folks and welcome to today's game

02:58.660 --> 03:04.420
You know Rick today's a key game between Russia and Canada as you know the winner will move on to the finals

03:04.780 --> 03:08.100
That's right and it looks like we're just about ready to start the match

03:08.100 --> 03:11.860
The ref is calling the players for the face off and here we go

03:12.180 --> 03:14.980
The Russians win position and immediately start up their attack

03:15.420 --> 03:18.180
Federal gets checked hard into the boards

03:18.580 --> 03:22.560
The least wish out has the puck now and he passes it to center. He shoots wow

03:22.560 --> 03:24.560
What a save by the golly

03:24.560 --> 03:28.540
All right the puck is back and play now. Heavy Moore is on a break away

03:28.540 --> 03:35.740
He is flying down the ice. The defenders can't keep up. Slap shot. He scored what an amazing goal

03:42.420 --> 03:50.460
All right, so the Canadians versus the Russians, huh? It reminds me of a classic classic game

03:50.460 --> 03:57.420
He's exactly the classic match. Yep, so let's take a look at some of the vocabulary that we heard in the dialogue in language take away

03:59.220 --> 04:01.220
Language take away

04:01.220 --> 04:05.620
We have five phrases in language take away today. And the first one is

04:06.180 --> 04:09.980
face off face off face off face off

04:10.540 --> 04:17.140
So Marco a face off here is a noun, right? It's a noun exactly and it's so in the beginning of a match

04:17.140 --> 04:22.100
The two players will stand face to face. Yes, right? That's why it's called kind of a face off

04:22.100 --> 04:26.300
Mm-hmm, and the referee will drop the puck. Yes, and they'll try to get it exactly

04:26.300 --> 04:31.540
So that's the face off the face off. Yeah, okay. Let's take a look at our next word

04:32.220 --> 04:34.220
check check

04:34.380 --> 04:36.380
To check to check

04:36.380 --> 04:41.420
So an interesting verb here, right? Yeah, it's really interesting because it's different from

04:41.740 --> 04:48.300
The way that you would say check or revise, right? Yes, yep. This is actually kind of a violent move

04:48.420 --> 04:55.500
Yeah, so what do you do? So basically in hockey you take your body and you hit another person with it

04:55.500 --> 05:03.180
Okay, so to check someone is to hit them with your body with your body, right? You can't use your arms or your legs or your hands

05:03.340 --> 05:10.100
You can only hit them like with your shoulder or your or your hip yeah hip check. Okay. So yeah, it's very cool

05:10.100 --> 05:11.100
All right

05:11.100 --> 05:18.060
Our next word golly golly golly golly golly golly is a person right and

05:18.860 --> 05:20.860
Probably the bravest

05:20.860 --> 05:25.420
Uh-huh, the hockey match. No kidding. So why don't you tell us what the golly does?

05:25.820 --> 05:31.980
The golly prevents the puck from coming in the net from going into the goal

05:31.980 --> 05:37.420
Yeah, so the golly stops the other team from getting a goal a goal. Yeah, okay

05:37.420 --> 05:43.580
So the golly prevents the goals. All right, very interesting now our fourth word is related to golly

05:43.580 --> 05:50.060
Yes, save save save save save a save a save. Yeah, it's a noun here

05:50.060 --> 05:56.700
It's a noun here. So the golly makes saves that's right when he stops a goal he

05:57.420 --> 06:05.660
Makes a save makes a save. Yeah, right. Yeah, okay. We have some example. So we can understand this form of using save. Yes

06:07.260 --> 06:09.260
Example one

06:10.700 --> 06:12.700
That was an unbelievable save

06:16.300 --> 06:18.300
Example two

06:19.660 --> 06:21.660
The golly didn't make the save

06:24.060 --> 06:26.060
Example three

06:27.100 --> 06:29.820
What a save the Russians win

06:32.140 --> 06:37.180
Yeah, a little bit unusual here that save is a noun instead of a verb

06:37.180 --> 06:39.820
But I think those examples were helpful

06:39.820 --> 06:42.620
Mm-hmm. Now let's take a look at our last word

06:43.260 --> 06:47.020
Breakaway breakaway breakaway a breakaway a breakaway

06:47.660 --> 06:54.620
Okay, so you have two words there that we know already break. Yes, all right and away. Yeah, so what are these two words together?

06:55.580 --> 07:04.060
Well imagine a group of hockey players all fighting to get the puck, right? And then one player breaks off

07:04.780 --> 07:13.020
breaks out of the group. Yeah, yeah, and he's he skates down the ice and he has the puck and he's far away from the other players

07:13.020 --> 07:18.380
Right, so he's going away from the other players by himself. Yeah, okay, so break away

07:19.100 --> 07:22.620
All right, so we've looked at a lot of hockey language here

07:22.700 --> 07:30.940
And I think it's time now to listen to our dialogue again. This time we're going to slow it down a little bit. Yeah, I think this will help you to

07:31.180 --> 07:33.180
Understand these words a little bit better

07:39.980 --> 07:46.860
Hello everyone. I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland

07:47.180 --> 07:54.540
Howdy folks and welcome to today's game. You know Rick today is a key game between Russia and Canada

07:55.100 --> 08:02.860
As you know the winner will move on to the finals. That's right and it looks like we're just about ready to start the match

08:03.260 --> 08:07.500
The ref is calling the players for the face-off and here we go

08:08.060 --> 08:11.660
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack

08:12.300 --> 08:14.940
Federal of gets checked hard into the boards

08:16.140 --> 08:24.060
Moly Sly shot has the puck now and passes it to the center. He shoots wow what a save by the golly

08:25.580 --> 08:28.700
All right the puck is back in play now

08:28.700 --> 08:31.340
Pavel Buray is on a break away

08:31.340 --> 08:35.260
He is flying down the ice the defenders can't keep up

08:35.740 --> 08:40.300
Slap shot he scores what an amazing goal

08:46.860 --> 08:52.700
Okay, this dialogue is interesting because we have commentators narrating or describing what's happening

08:52.700 --> 08:56.860
Yeah, and that moment, right? Yeah, and they're using some interesting grammar aren't they?

08:56.860 --> 09:00.460
Exactly, they are because some actions are happening in that moment

09:00.940 --> 09:05.980
But we noticed something a little bit strange. All right, well, let's look at it and grammar break down

09:07.500 --> 09:09.500
Rama break down

09:09.820 --> 09:13.260
Okay, let's listen to this sentence that we previously heard in the dialogue

09:14.140 --> 09:19.100
Moly Sly shot has the puck now and passes it to the center. He shoots

09:21.660 --> 09:26.620
Moly Sly shot has the puck now and passes it to the center. He shoots

09:27.580 --> 09:33.980
I noticed that he's using the present simple, right? Yeah, yeah, even though the action is now

09:34.620 --> 09:39.340
It's in present simple. Yes, even though the action is happening in that moment

09:39.580 --> 09:43.340
He's not using the present progressive. Yeah, doesn't continuous. Yeah

09:44.060 --> 09:50.300
This is because if you notice the actions are very very brief and fast and fast and exciting

09:50.300 --> 09:54.620
Exactly, so you don't really have enough time to say for example

09:55.020 --> 09:57.020
He is shooting

09:57.020 --> 10:01.020
Yes, because it's only one quick action. He shoots the puck very fast

10:01.740 --> 10:07.260
Right, or for example, you wouldn't really say he is passing. Yeah, he is passing the puck right

10:07.260 --> 10:14.940
It's just one quick action. He takes it and passes it and the action is finished. Yes, I think we can see a few more examples of this

10:15.740 --> 10:17.740
Let's listen again

10:18.460 --> 10:21.980
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack

10:24.700 --> 10:28.300
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack

10:30.620 --> 10:38.140
Here we can hear that he is using the present simple again because these are very short actions that

10:38.140 --> 10:45.580
Finish quickly, right? Exactly, and it's actually very very common when you're describing something you see

10:46.780 --> 10:52.380
That's happening now. That's really exciting. It's common to use present simple

10:52.460 --> 10:57.100
Exactly, if you pay attention most sporting events are in the same way. Yep

10:57.980 --> 11:04.860
They would describe the actions that are happening in the present simple. Yeah, not present progressive. Yeah, but Marko you have an example of

11:05.420 --> 11:10.140
Up some present progressive here, right? Yes. Let's listen to this sentence

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
He is flying down the ice

11:14.540 --> 11:16.540
He is flying down the ice

11:17.260 --> 11:20.140
Now we heard the sentence. He is flying down the ice

11:20.860 --> 11:27.100
Right now this one is in progressive. Yeah, why is that? Well, first of all when we say he's flying down the ice

11:27.100 --> 11:33.260
It's not that he's literally flying. No, he's not an airplane. He's just skating really fast. Yeah, right?

11:33.260 --> 11:36.860
So we kind of exaggerate and we say oh, he's flying down the ice

11:37.740 --> 11:45.020
But he's actually skating. So this is a progressive action. So he is doing it. It's happening for more than one second

11:45.020 --> 11:51.500
Yeah, yeah exactly. So that's why we would say he is flying down the ice instead of he flies down the ice

11:51.500 --> 11:54.940
Yes, right? Yep, and let's say it was like really really really fast

11:55.900 --> 12:04.220
Okay, okay, so here we see that sometimes in English we do use present simple to talk about what's happening now

12:05.180 --> 12:10.860
When it happens really really quickly or when we want to show that it's really exciting

12:10.940 --> 12:16.380
Exactly. Yeah, makes it much more exciting if we just use the present simple. Yeah, okay

12:16.380 --> 12:21.260
Let's listen to this exciting dialogue one more time and we'll come back and talk a little bit more

12:21.260 --> 12:43.100
Hello everyone. I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland. Howdy folks and welcome to today's game

12:43.420 --> 12:48.940
You know Rick today's a key game between Russia and Canada as you know the winner will move on to the finals

12:49.420 --> 12:54.940
That's right, and it looks like we're just about ready to start the match the ref is calling the players for the face off

12:55.420 --> 12:59.500
And here we go the Russians win position and immediately start up their attack

12:59.980 --> 13:02.620
Federov gets checked hard into the boards

13:03.180 --> 13:08.300
But he's wish out has the pup now and he passes it to center. He shoots wow. What a save by the golly

13:09.180 --> 13:13.020
All right, the pup is back in play now. Have a bore is on a breakaway

13:13.260 --> 13:16.540
He is flying down the ice the defenders can't keep up

13:16.940 --> 13:20.140
Slept shot. He scores what an amazing goal

13:26.700 --> 13:30.220
All right, so hockey is the Canadian national sport

13:30.700 --> 13:35.260
Well, actually it isn't the business for yeah, what is it lacrosse is our cross?

13:35.260 --> 13:39.500
Yeah, but anyway, we're not we don't have a lesson about real cross today not yet no

13:40.140 --> 13:43.020
But actually all Canadians love hockey

13:43.260 --> 13:48.460
Like we start playing hockey when we're about two years old. Yeah, I've heard that yeah

13:48.460 --> 13:53.900
I've heard that some Canadian children learn how to skate before they learn how to walk. It's totally comment

13:55.100 --> 14:01.100
Well, it is a great sport very very exciting. It's very fast-paced and it's very aggressive

14:01.100 --> 14:06.140
That's what I like about it. I know not violent but very aggressive. Yeah, but you know what I

14:06.540 --> 14:12.620
Must tell you that I am not a good Canadian. You're not a hockey fan. No, I'm really yeah

14:12.620 --> 14:15.260
I really I really hate hockey. Why I

14:16.300 --> 14:21.580
You know the puck is so small it's hard to see where it is on the ice and it's cold and

14:22.220 --> 14:26.300
These guys are fighting and anyway have you ever been to a hockey game? Yeah

14:27.180 --> 14:30.300
Many times and I just find that the puck is really small

14:31.180 --> 14:33.500
Maybe you just need better since maybe

14:34.540 --> 14:40.380
Well, what do you guys think about hockey? We'll post some some videos and some pictures of hockey on on the comments section
