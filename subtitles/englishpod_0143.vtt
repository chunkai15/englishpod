00:00.000 --> 00:08.240
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco and my name is Catherine

00:08.240 --> 00:12.720
and today we're going to be visiting one of my favorite places I must say.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.120
Really serious. You're a big meat eater.

00:15.120 --> 00:20.560
I am. I have to have meat every day so that's why I usually go to the butcher.

00:20.560 --> 00:26.160
Alright so vegetarians be warned today's dialogue is all about eating meat and where to go

00:26.160 --> 00:29.280
to get meat. So as Marco said that place is called the butcher's.

00:29.280 --> 00:33.120
So we're going to be visiting the butcher and we're going to learn all the different types of meat

00:33.120 --> 00:38.240
you can find there. Great so we don't have anything to preview but before we get started just

00:38.240 --> 00:42.400
like to mention that you're going to hear a lot of different kinds of words and we're back in a

00:42.400 --> 00:46.400
minute to talk about what they mean.

00:56.160 --> 01:05.920
I'd like half pound of ground beef please. Good choice. Our ground beef is extra lean if you know

01:05.920 --> 01:12.480
what I mean. Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breast?

01:12.480 --> 01:21.680
No, no, no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some nice chicken thighs.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.400
No, that won't do. I'll take this smoked ham you have here.

01:26.400 --> 01:32.400
Okay. Is there anything else? Is this salami and bologna you have here?

01:33.200 --> 01:41.440
Yes. It's very fine meat. Made it myself. Sounds good. Okay that's it.

01:41.440 --> 01:49.200
Wait. We have tea bowl, ribeye, and sirloin sticks. They are very fresh.

01:49.760 --> 01:56.800
Just came from the slaughterhouse. No, that's okay really. I think that's all for today.

02:03.440 --> 02:13.040
Okay that'll be $34.50. All right we're back so this butcher was kind of creepy in the

02:13.040 --> 02:18.240
beginning. Very creepy in the beginning. I think that's usually the conception that you have

02:18.320 --> 02:24.080
butchers because they always have a knife and they're always covered in blood but it's not human blood.

02:24.080 --> 02:33.840
Right like the movies, we need Todd. Yeah like we need Todd. But we actually took a look at a lot

02:33.840 --> 02:39.680
of different types of meat that the woman was ordering. So why don't we take a look at these now in

02:39.680 --> 02:48.080
language takeaway? Language takeaway. Okay so the first is a classic cut. This is something that

02:48.080 --> 02:54.400
we had at my house about once a week growing up it's called a pork chop pork chop. So a pork chop

02:54.400 --> 02:59.040
comes from the animal, the pork or pig. Yeah we actually don't say pork to mean the animal.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.680
Pork just means the kind of meat that comes from a pig. So big difference there when we're talking

03:03.680 --> 03:10.880
about food we say pork. Wow and what about a pork chop so what exactly is that? Chop is usually

03:10.880 --> 03:18.000
just on the bone and oftentimes it's fried or baked I guess but it's just a piece of pork on

03:18.000 --> 03:25.600
the bone and a chop you just imagine a knife chopping something. All right so a pork chop very good

03:25.600 --> 03:31.600
and after pork chops we were ordering some ground beef. All right so ground beef is another

03:31.600 --> 03:39.200
important one ground beef is beef that's been chopped up and pushed through a machine that kind of

03:39.200 --> 03:46.640
pushes it out in very very small bits. Okay there's no bone. So ground comes from the verb to grind

03:46.960 --> 03:52.880
so to grind up meat to make it very very small pieces. All right so if you want to make a spaghetti

03:52.880 --> 03:58.640
bowl of niese the kind of beef you use is ground beef or even hamburgers. What are you exactly?

03:58.640 --> 04:02.560
So ground beef you ground up beef. What are other things would you grind?

04:03.280 --> 04:09.200
Oh you could grind your teeth? You can grind. Some people do that when they're sleeping and they grind

04:09.200 --> 04:16.000
their teeth. You can grind pepper grinders you know pepper sometimes come in balls you have to

04:16.080 --> 04:22.080
grind them to make them smaller and broken down. Very good so that's ground beef and from the

04:22.080 --> 04:30.800
verb to grind. Now we are buying some boneless chicken breasts. All right so boneless as you have

04:30.800 --> 04:39.280
guests means without bones and chicken breasts are usually just a really nice juicy kind of tender

04:39.280 --> 04:46.080
cut of meat from the chicken from the kind of underside of the chicken where obviously yeah they

04:46.080 --> 04:50.880
have it it's not a wing it's not a leg it's just a chicken breast. All right so boneless chicken

04:50.880 --> 04:56.000
but now usually it is boneless right when you buy it at the supermarket. Yeah yeah. Next up we've got

04:56.000 --> 05:03.600
some classic deli counter favorites these are our cold cuts. All right so cold cuts now this

05:03.680 --> 05:09.760
means that they are cold. Oh well yeah they're cold but I think cold cuts the most important

05:09.760 --> 05:16.160
thing to remember here is that they're mostly like kinds of salami or cured meats so these are

05:16.160 --> 05:22.560
salt cured or their drive meats and you usually have them on sandwiches so like a salami sandwich.

05:22.560 --> 05:28.000
So like cured meat you mean that meat has it hasn't been cooked. Oh no it's not been cooked but it's

05:28.000 --> 05:32.640
treated in a way that allows it to last for a very long time. All right so they look like

05:32.720 --> 05:39.280
long long tubes of meat or they look very dry. So they look very dry like a jerky for example.

05:39.280 --> 05:45.440
All right so cured meat now for example we have salami and baloney.

05:45.440 --> 05:52.480
Baloney. Now it's interesting because baloney is actually spelled BOLOG and A so you

05:52.480 --> 05:58.480
say balona balona or something like that. Well I think comes in the Italian balonia. All right but

05:58.800 --> 06:03.520
it's definitely a change that happened in the English language when it came over from Italy but baloney

06:03.520 --> 06:09.600
is a kind of meat that's got it's got a very funny looking name. Yeah so you're more sophisticated than

06:09.600 --> 06:17.040
I am that's why you know this dude. I just speak Italian. All right so you have salami baloney and

06:17.600 --> 06:22.080
pastrami. Pastrami what about ham is that considered a cold cut? You can have ham in the

06:22.080 --> 06:28.080
cold cut section because ham sometimes comes in tubes you slice but ham is also just a normal

06:28.480 --> 06:34.320
kind of pork pork but ham is cured you know like a smoked ham. Exactly we're smoked turkey

06:34.320 --> 06:40.720
one of my favorites. Very good and well now moving on from the cold cuts we're going to concentrate

06:40.720 --> 06:46.720
on steaks. Ooh steak so there are a thousand kinds of steaks in this world and every city seems

06:46.720 --> 06:52.000
to have its own kinds but here we're only looking at three the first of which is the teabone.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.200
All right the teabone steak I think is one of the most popular ones definitely. It's a steak

06:57.280 --> 07:04.400
it's pretty big right? Yeah well yeah I can't be and it has a bone inside that looks like a teabone.

07:04.400 --> 07:10.560
All right so you're saying Marco that the teabone is named after the shape and the look of this

07:10.560 --> 07:18.480
steak. Yeah teabone steak. All right and as well as our next one is also a rib eye. Okay so the rib eye

07:18.480 --> 07:24.160
I think actually has a piece of the rib in it so the rib is the bone and there's a circle which is kind

07:24.160 --> 07:28.480
of a it's the piece of meat is sliced off the rib and the circle is actually part of that rib so

07:28.480 --> 07:35.680
there's a little bit of bone in it but it's not as bone as the teabone. Right so it does have one

07:35.680 --> 07:40.640
small bone that kind of looks like a knife because you can see through it and our next steak has

07:40.640 --> 07:46.720
no bone and is the most tender and the best steak you can have sirloin steak. So I think the

07:46.720 --> 07:51.200
sirloin is definitely the most expensive if you're in a restaurant definitely the most tender I

07:51.200 --> 07:56.400
think of all those delicious and usually you can have like a big sirloin steak like a half a kilo

07:56.400 --> 08:04.240
like a 400 grams sirloin steak at a friend of it a full kilo really sirloin steak for is it a competition

08:04.240 --> 08:09.760
or no there's a kind of steak called the best steak. I love your antenna in Italy it's the

08:09.760 --> 08:16.800
the Florentine beef steak and it is it can be about a kilo of meat wow yeah I bet you can't even

08:16.880 --> 08:23.120
move after that. No you know you fall asleep with your head and your soup on the table. All right so

08:23.120 --> 08:28.880
that's all the meat related words that we have for you today so why don't we move on now to

08:28.880 --> 08:32.160
Florentine builder where we're going to take a look at some of the phrases in this dialogue.

08:33.440 --> 08:38.480
Florentine builder we're going to look at the phrases if you know what I mean.

08:38.480 --> 08:44.160
If you know what I mean. Now I love this phrase if you know what I mean. I do know what you mean.

08:44.240 --> 08:51.360
Well it's I like it too. So you can use it for sarcasm yeah right or you can use it to kind of

08:51.360 --> 08:57.120
insinuate something right exactly yeah so you're what you're saying you're saying there's a double

08:57.120 --> 09:02.720
meaning in what I want to say so there's two things I could say and I'm not going to say it outright but

09:02.720 --> 09:10.800
you know this thing that we can't really say. So for example we can say she likes to go out

09:10.880 --> 09:16.080
if you know what I mean. All right so you're insinuating that not only does she like to go out but

09:16.080 --> 09:20.880
maybe maybe she goes out a lot a lot or maybe she gets drunk or something like that. Yeah.

09:20.880 --> 09:25.680
So it's kind of like a double meaning but you're trying to be subtle. Yeah but it's not so

09:25.680 --> 09:31.360
subtle because you're actually saying like this is that what I mean or um she's eating for

09:31.360 --> 09:36.160
too if you know what I mean. Oh there we go so you're insinuating that well you're not really

09:36.160 --> 09:41.040
insinuating you're telling me that. She's pregnant. Eating for too is a common idiom and

09:41.040 --> 09:47.280
English that means that a person a woman has a well it's going to have a baby. So here I'm saying hey

09:47.280 --> 09:52.080
do you know this idiom? She's eating for too if you know what I mean. Yeah. I mean quaint quaint quaint quaint.

09:52.080 --> 09:57.520
I mean quaint. So now why don't we take a look at some other examples of how we could use

09:57.520 --> 10:01.840
if you know what I mean in different circumstances when you're trying to insinuate something.

10:01.920 --> 10:10.320
Example one. She's eating for too now if you know what I mean. Example two.

10:12.160 --> 10:16.960
Tim hit a home run today if you know what I mean. Example three.

10:18.880 --> 10:22.320
Jim and Laura are going their separate ways if you know what I mean.

10:24.560 --> 10:29.040
All right we're back so um now that that's clear why don't we move on to our next phrase.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.960
So this one is accounting phrase and for those of you who have heard the word doesn't before it

10:32.960 --> 10:40.400
might not be so new the phrase is half a dozen. Half a dozen. So that means half a 12. 12. So it

10:40.400 --> 10:46.240
doesn't is 12 and it's I'm not really sure when this started being used in English but a

10:46.240 --> 10:53.440
dozen is 12 and half a dozen is then six. Now there's another phrase or another saying that's very

10:53.520 --> 11:00.880
common a dime a dozen. He's a dime a dozen. So that means you can get 12 of the same type of guys for

11:00.880 --> 11:07.360
10 cents. Right so they're easy to find. They're easy to find. Yeah. The dime it doesn't. All right very

11:07.360 --> 11:13.120
good and moving on to our last one. When they were talking they said something about the meat being

11:13.120 --> 11:20.640
lean extra lean. Okay lean this is not mean a lean on a door. Right. This is not like resting

11:20.640 --> 11:26.720
on something. This is actually a kind of um weighted described food. And so food is lean if it's

11:26.720 --> 11:34.240
not got much fat. It's not fatty. Okay so if it's lean it doesn't have much fat. Exactly so I prefer

11:34.240 --> 11:40.880
to eat lean meats so I often eat um birds and poultry so chicken I like it pretty lean and if it's

11:40.880 --> 11:46.880
got fat on it I'll cut the fat off. Okay like the skin the skin is fat right? Yeah. All right so you

11:47.040 --> 11:52.960
can have lean beef. It doesn't have much fat around it. Yeah and in America actually on the

11:52.960 --> 11:59.200
the packages at the supermarket it often says the percentage of meat that you have so it's 95% lean

11:59.200 --> 12:06.720
or 98% lean. So that means you have 3% fat in there. Exactly. Exactly. My math skills are amazing.

12:06.720 --> 12:12.160
All right so um now that we've finished with all of these words on fluency builder let's take a look

12:12.160 --> 12:31.360
at a dialogue for the last time. I'd like half pound of ground beef please. Good choice.

12:31.360 --> 12:39.680
Our ground beef is extra lean if you know what I mean. Could I also have half a dozen pork chops

12:39.840 --> 12:49.040
and two pounds of bonus chicken breast? No no no chicken breasts at the moment but we have some

12:49.040 --> 12:58.640
nice chicken thighs. No that won't do. I'll take this smoked ham you have here. Okay is there anything else?

12:59.440 --> 13:08.240
Is this salami and bologna you have here? Yes it's very fine need. Made it myself.

13:09.120 --> 13:18.800
Sounds good. Okay that's it. Wait we have tea room. Remi and sirloin sticks. They are very fresh.

13:19.440 --> 13:26.480
Just came from the slaughterhouse. Hmm no that's okay really. I think that's all for today.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.200
Okay that'll be $34.50.

13:38.480 --> 13:47.200
All right we're back so Catherine are you a big beef or meat eater? Definitely am it helps that

13:47.200 --> 13:53.600
my partner and crime is from Kansas City and they have the best among the best steaks in our

13:53.600 --> 13:59.840
entire country in Kansas City. Wow I actually miss um there was a back in California we had the

13:59.840 --> 14:06.400
$6 burger from Carl's Jr it was just basically beef bacon cheese it was just like this huge

14:06.480 --> 14:12.320
burger with full of meat and obviously a lot of calories. Okay but it was delicious I'm

14:13.360 --> 14:18.880
an egg woulder we are very used to having some meat product every day with our food. Yeah well

14:18.880 --> 14:24.880
it's the same in the Midwest actually from where we're from um the it's the same in the Midwest

14:24.880 --> 14:30.480
because people in the Midwest generally think that if you're not eating meat then you know what are you eating

14:30.720 --> 14:37.840
bread. Right corn so uh so meat is considered a healthy part of the day and you definitely eat it with your

14:37.840 --> 14:43.120
meals. Yeah and I'm sure our vegetarian listeners might not appreciate this but you know it's just

14:43.120 --> 14:48.960
kind of different diet some people eat for example rice every day. So we're in other countries you

14:48.960 --> 14:55.040
wouldn't really have rice every day or for example when I was in Chile had a lot of potatoes. Really.

14:55.040 --> 14:59.840
A lot of potato. Have you ever had an Argentine steak I hear they had the best beef in the world?

14:59.920 --> 15:05.200
They are not only delicious but they are very inexpensive and it's amazing. You can have a

15:05.200 --> 15:11.040
like a complete steak buffet for like I don't know like it can't even remember but it was just

15:11.040 --> 15:16.240
I sat there for three hours and couldn't move and kept eating. Yeah was it is it true you can eat

15:16.240 --> 15:21.440
it with a spoon. It's so soft. Some of the meat is very very tender and not if it's grilled you can't

15:21.440 --> 15:25.600
really do that but in other preparations it's almost like that. It's a nice butter sauce.

15:26.400 --> 15:32.400
herbs. All right so you've made me hungry. I think we're going to take off and have some

15:32.400 --> 15:38.560
a burgers. All right so if you have any questions any comments please come to our website at
