00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
Hello everyone and welcome back to English Pod.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.840
We have an advanced lesson for you today.

00:07.840 --> 00:08.840
My name is Marco.

00:08.840 --> 00:12.040
And my name is Catherine and I'm very excited about this lesson Marco.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.040
It's very interesting.

00:13.040 --> 00:19.920
It's about a very controversial topic and a very popular person in history, Charles Darwin.

00:19.920 --> 00:20.920
That's right.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.320
So he's most famous perhaps for his book The Origin of the Species and we're going to be

00:24.320 --> 00:26.440
talking a lot about science today.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.760
So put your thinking caps on.

00:29.240 --> 00:33.520
So without further ado, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

00:42.520 --> 00:43.920
Man, it's been forever.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.600
What have you been up to lately?

00:45.600 --> 00:48.120
I've been busy preparing for my exams.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.720
Not to mention all the term papers have had to write.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.720
Same here.

00:51.720 --> 00:55.760
I'm up to my neck and work but at least you've got some of our holidays after finals.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.160
Where you headed now?

00:57.160 --> 00:58.720
I'm going to my anthro class.

00:58.880 --> 01:04.080
We've been focusing on Darwin all term since it's a 200th anniversary of his birth or whatever.

01:04.080 --> 01:07.360
I'm sick and tired of Darwin Darwin Darwin.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.720
What? Why?

01:08.720 --> 01:10.400
How can you not like Darwin?

01:10.400 --> 01:14.640
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.680
This theory of evolution revolutionized the field of biology and anthropology.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.720
I don't like him.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.720
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.200
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.480
Say that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.160
Not to mention your professors.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.560
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process

01:36.560 --> 01:41.440
of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world

01:41.440 --> 01:43.280
and its very beginnings.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.040
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.

01:47.040 --> 01:51.520
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.040
What are you talking about?

01:53.040 --> 01:55.280
Which came first? The chicken or the egg?

01:55.360 --> 01:59.600
This is a classic logical problem and I think it applies to Darwin's theory.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.640
How did the very first living organism come to be?

02:02.640 --> 02:03.440
Interesting.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.600
I think that question is better suited for my velocity class.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.800
In the meantime, how about we settle this?

02:10.800 --> 02:11.600
With a duel!

02:11.760 --> 02:26.400
All right, interesting. They have very different views on Charles Darwin, right?

02:26.400 --> 02:28.160
They do and they're both pretty nerdy people.

02:28.160 --> 02:33.840
This is a very nerdy university conversation that's happening between classes.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.640
I think maybe they're like PhD candidates or something.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.080
Perhaps.

02:38.080 --> 02:42.240
All right, so before we get to talking about some of the ideas in today's dialogue,

02:42.240 --> 02:45.680
let's talk about some of the words and phrases that we hear to understand better what's going on.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.560
The first part we're going to talk about in today's language takeaway.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.280
Language takeaway.

02:52.480 --> 02:56.160
All right, on language takeaway today, let's take a look at the first word and

02:56.160 --> 03:02.480
well, one of the things that many people say is that Darwin revolutionized the fields of biology.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.320
And so he revolutionized these because he pushed them forward.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.000
He made many changes.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.440
He forced changes.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.080
So people had to change the way that they thought about these things.

03:12.080 --> 03:17.840
If you revolutionize something a topic or an idea you are creating new knowledge almost, right?

03:17.840 --> 03:20.320
Exactly. You can think of the word revolution, which is a thing.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.680
So you think of the Russian revolution or the American revolution.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.440
These are times of change.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.880
So two revolutionized is to bring about change.

03:28.880 --> 03:29.680
Very good.

03:29.680 --> 03:33.280
All right, so moving forward, they were talking about human evolution.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.560
Human evolution.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.680
What is that exactly?

03:35.680 --> 03:36.480
Good question.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.680
So you're not a monkey, I'm not a monkey, but we come from monkeys, right?

03:39.680 --> 03:41.120
So we evolved.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.080
Right, so the process is called human evolution.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.640
That means the process by which humans changed forms to become what we are today.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.080
Okay, so you evolve.

03:50.080 --> 03:53.280
Now is it evolution usually think of something positive, right?

03:53.280 --> 03:55.520
Something evolves into something better.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.960
Is it always that way?

03:56.960 --> 03:59.680
Um, no, we have another word for the negative, right?

03:59.680 --> 04:06.160
So the positive is to evolve to become better, to get worse is to devolve.

04:06.160 --> 04:11.360
Okay, to devolve, to go back and to kind of lose things that you had.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.800
Okay, interesting.

04:12.800 --> 04:18.080
And then they were also talking about Darwin's theory of natural selection, natural selection.

04:18.080 --> 04:21.680
Okay, this is maybe one of the things that Darwin was most famous for and that's why we've

04:21.680 --> 04:25.360
included in this language takeaway because it's a key phrase.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.120
It's something you hear people talk about along.

04:27.200 --> 04:34.800
Okay, so natural selection is a process again and it's the process by which stronger animals

04:34.800 --> 04:37.920
survive over time and weaker animals don't.

04:37.920 --> 04:44.480
So if there's a weak species, it can't really survive because it keeps dying and dying.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.840
And then finally, there's no more.

04:45.840 --> 04:50.880
And so this is called natural selection because no one's actually choosing what animals will

04:50.880 --> 04:52.800
survive, but it's kind of a natural process.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.400
Right, mother nature is choosing it.

04:54.400 --> 04:54.880
Right.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.520
Very good.

04:55.520 --> 05:00.880
So natural selection, this is one of the things that Darwin is most famous for.

05:00.880 --> 05:06.560
And well, as Catherine mentioned, Darwin wrote the book origin of the species.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.800
Right, so origin means beginning.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.440
So the origin of mankind, right?

05:11.440 --> 05:13.040
So there are many different kinds of animals.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.800
You could even see there are many different kinds of mammals.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.120
But there are many different species within that.

05:19.120 --> 05:25.120
So human beings, black bears, coales, chimpanzees, these are all species.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.520
And so species is a classification.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.320
So the origin of the species is kind of a way of telling the story of how all these things came about.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.720
All right, the origin of the species.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.440
And the last one, this word is kind of strange.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.400
He talked about the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.000
Okay, conundrum.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.280
I love this word.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.840
It's very funny sounding, conundrum.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.320
It means like a problem or a vittal or something that's hard to understand.

05:50.320 --> 05:54.320
All right, so in this case, it's the conundrum of the chicken and the egg, right,

05:54.400 --> 05:55.520
which came first.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.200
How else can you use conundrum?

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
You could say that maybe there's a situation that's very strange and hard to understand.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.400
This is quite a conundrum.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.240
This is quite a conundrum we have.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.120
Yes, so it sounds very fancy, very well educated.

06:09.120 --> 06:09.920
It does.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.880
All right, so interesting words on language takeaway.

06:12.880 --> 06:17.040
Why don't we move on now to four phrases on fluency builder?

06:18.240 --> 06:19.280
Fluency builder.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.280
All right, on fluency builder today, we have four phrases as we said.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.480
So what's the first one?

06:24.480 --> 06:25.680
The first one is great.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.760
It's a, it's very visual.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.760
You say I'm up to my neck in work.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.240
I'm up to my neck in papers to write.

06:32.240 --> 06:32.720
Mm-hmm.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.280
All right, so this means I have so much stuff to do that you could pile it up and it

06:37.280 --> 06:38.640
would come up to my neck.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.760
So I have as many papers that are almost as tall as I am.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.320
Exactly.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.040
And so I could say I'm up to my neck in work.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.880
I have no more time to do anything.

06:46.880 --> 06:51.440
Sometimes people also say I'm up to here and then those like the point,

06:51.440 --> 06:54.000
the point at their forehead or something around their head.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.880
I'm up to, I'm up to here with your nonsense.

06:56.880 --> 06:57.520
Exactly.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.320
So this is a way of saying that I'm really busy.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.240
Really busy and really tired of it.

07:02.240 --> 07:06.880
All right, and our next phrase is one that most mothers use.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.480
I'm sick and tired.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.440
Oh, I'm sick and tired of all of your whining.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.680
Go do the dishes and don't complain.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.000
All right, so it's always, it always goes together.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.840
You are sick and tired.

07:17.840 --> 07:18.960
Right, and sick comes first.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.480
So I'm sick and tired of this.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.120
I'm sick and tired of your bad attitude.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.520
Okay, so, and that means that you are,

07:25.520 --> 07:26.640
I'm just tired of it.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.880
I don't want you to have a bad attitude anymore.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.200
Or I'm just, yeah, I'm really annoyed by it.

07:31.200 --> 07:31.840
I'm annoyed.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.440
Okay, sick and tired.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.520
And then we saw a phrase that was a little bit separated.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.520
He said the sentence went like this.

07:37.520 --> 07:42.320
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.400
So to turn something on its head.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.560
Like you said, Marco, it's split into two parts.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.000
So he turned the field of computer science on its head.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.320
So to turn on its head means to completely reverse something,

07:54.320 --> 07:55.520
to turn it around.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.520
You think 180 degrees.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.000
Okay.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.960
And so if biology used to be one way,

08:00.960 --> 08:03.840
then Darwin made it completely different.

08:03.840 --> 08:07.920
So we can say that Isaac Newton completely turned physics on its head with his theory

08:07.920 --> 08:10.400
or his findings on gravity.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.640
And then years and years later,

08:12.640 --> 08:15.760
we had Albert Einstein who turned those theories

08:16.160 --> 08:19.840
or who turned that theory on its head with his own ideas about physics.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.560
Very good.

08:20.560 --> 08:26.160
So to turn something on its head to completely change the course of or prove something to be

08:26.160 --> 08:26.640
maybe wrong.

08:27.440 --> 08:33.520
And the last phrase that we have is the person argued that Darwin's theories were full of holes.

08:33.520 --> 08:38.000
Okay, so to say a theory is full of holes is a little bit different than saying that his pants

08:38.000 --> 08:40.720
are full of holes because when you say something is full of holes,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.320
maybe they actually have holes.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.240
But a theory is it's an idea.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.600
So it can't have holes.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.440
What you're saying is that it's not completely sound.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.760
It's not without some problems.

08:51.760 --> 08:56.720
And so maybe you're saying that, well, the cookies are gone out of the kitchen

08:56.720 --> 08:57.280
Marco.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.720
And I saw you in the kitchen.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.040
So clearly you ate the cookies.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.920
Right, so I can say that's full of holes because it was me.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.600
And it was three other people who were in the kitchen.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.480
So you can clean me.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.160
Put it in the two other two people.

09:08.160 --> 09:08.640
Right.

09:08.640 --> 09:13.360
So if something is full of holes is that it has maybe mistakes or it's still missing

09:13.360 --> 09:15.200
complete evidence to prove it right.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.720
Or it has bad logic.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.360
Bad logic.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.720
All right, interesting.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.640
So we've taken a look at a lot of words and different phrases here.

09:22.640 --> 09:33.600
Let's listen to this argument one last time.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.320
Man, it's been forever.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.000
What have you been up to lately?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.480
I've been busy preparing for my exams.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.200
Not to mention all the term papers of head or right.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.160
Same here.

09:44.160 --> 09:48.160
I'm out to my neck and work, but at least you've got some of our holidays after finals.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.440
Where you headed now?

09:49.440 --> 09:51.200
I'm going to my anthro class.

09:51.200 --> 09:56.480
We've been focusing on Darwin all term since it's a 200th anniversary of his birth or whatever.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.760
I'm sick and tired of Darwin Darwin Darwin.

09:59.760 --> 10:00.400
What?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.120
Why?

10:01.120 --> 10:02.800
How can you not like Darwin?

10:02.800 --> 10:06.960
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

10:07.040 --> 10:12.080
This theory of evolution revolutionized the field of biology and anthropology.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.200
I don't like him.

10:13.200 --> 10:17.040
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.880
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.880
Save that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.640
Not to mention your professors.

10:24.640 --> 10:29.120
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process of

10:29.120 --> 10:34.240
natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world and its

10:34.240 --> 10:35.600
very beginnings.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.440
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.

10:39.440 --> 10:43.840
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.440
What are you talking about?

10:45.440 --> 10:46.400
Which came first?

10:46.400 --> 10:47.680
The chicken or the egg?

10:47.680 --> 10:52.000
This is a classic logical problem and I think it applies to Darwin's theory.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.120
How did the very first living organism come to be?

10:55.120 --> 10:55.840
Interesting.

10:56.640 --> 11:00.080
I think that question has better suited for my velocity class.

11:00.080 --> 11:03.280
In the meantime, how about we settle this?

11:03.280 --> 11:16.080
With a duel?

11:16.080 --> 11:22.960
We're back so interesting this Darwin's theories and his explanations for the origin of species and

11:22.960 --> 11:24.480
life as we know it.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.920
But there is the opposite to this.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.640
There is a certain thing called creationism.

11:28.640 --> 11:32.480
There is and this is a big source of controversy, especially in the United States,

11:33.440 --> 11:38.640
in some places people want to teach creationism as well as evolution in schools.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.320
So this is the big question.

11:40.320 --> 11:46.960
Are they still equal as theories or is one theory more proven than the other?

11:46.960 --> 11:47.760
Right.

11:47.760 --> 11:53.520
And it is kind of hard to determine which one is better because one is based on faith.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.240
The other one is based more on scientific evidence.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.680
So they're not really even the same on the same scale as we learned before.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.680
That's kind of like apples and oranges.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.960
It is and there are some people who would say that we have lots of ways of

12:06.960 --> 12:10.640
of quote unquote proving what happened in the past.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.120
But as long as we weren't there, we never really do know.

12:13.120 --> 12:13.840
Right.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.480
And there's always changes in science.

12:16.480 --> 12:20.000
So how can we be sure that what we know now isn't false?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.440
Is it misunderstanding?

12:21.440 --> 12:25.040
Right. I think for now, this is the best explanation.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.640
But that doesn't mean that it's the correct one.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.400
Maybe in a hundred years from now we'll have another explanation that's much better

12:32.400 --> 12:34.560
or maybe complimentary to this one.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.560
Well, we want to know what you guys think come to our website EnglishPod.com.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.080
We really want to hear your opinions.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.280
What do you think about this topic?

12:41.280 --> 12:42.640
It is a little bit controversial.

12:42.640 --> 12:46.480
So we really look forward to your comments and any other questions you may have.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.280
Yep.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.720
And just a reference.

12:48.720 --> 12:54.080
Creationism is the idea that God created the world or a superior being created the world

12:54.080 --> 12:56.400
and that everything came from that.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.320
Let us know what you think.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.840
I am very curious too.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.200
And that's about it for today.

13:01.200 --> 13:01.600
All right.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.040
I'll see you guys there. Bye-bye.
