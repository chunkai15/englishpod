00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Hello English learners. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:05.200 --> 00:11.360
And I'm Erica. And today we're bringing you another sci-fi lesson for all of those fans out there

00:11.360 --> 00:16.320
of Star Trek and Star Wars. That's right. And today we're going to focus on some phrases.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.560
We're not going to do any vocabulary today. We're just going to learn some phrases that you'll find

00:20.560 --> 00:26.800
relating to science fiction. Okay. Very good. So why don't we listen to a dialogue for the first time

00:26.800 --> 00:28.800
and we'll come back and look at all these phrases?

00:36.720 --> 00:39.920
Captain, we are under attack by an unidentified ship.

00:39.920 --> 00:45.200
Damage report. We've sustained heavy damages to the engines. We've lost our work drive.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.520
We'll have to attempt to make contact.

00:51.280 --> 00:56.160
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. We don't wish to engage.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.160
What is the nature of this attack?

01:02.560 --> 01:07.760
No, you're not doing it right. Card doesn't sound like that. His voice is deeper.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.320
I am Captain Core of the ship.

01:11.600 --> 01:17.600
No, if you can't do it authentically on voice, I'll have to find a more serious Star Trek fan

01:17.600 --> 01:19.600
who can actually act. Okay?

01:19.600 --> 01:23.600
What? What? I already fought the Klingon suit and the wig.

01:26.560 --> 01:33.200
All right. Very good at Star Trek fans. Apparently they were trying to act out one of the famous

01:33.200 --> 01:39.440
episodes where the Klingon's attack the Enterprise. My goodness. I don't know a lot about

01:40.000 --> 01:44.720
Star Trek, but I do know a lot about language and we've got some great stuff here that will help you

01:44.720 --> 01:50.320
understand sci-fi movies and TV shows in English a little bit better. So why don't we go now to

01:50.320 --> 01:56.080
fluency builder? Fluency builder. All right. So the first phrase that we have today

01:56.080 --> 02:05.520
on fluency builder. Unidentified ship. Unidentified ship. Unidentified ship. If we break it down and

02:05.520 --> 02:10.240
look at the first word, unidentified. You don't know which one it is. Okay. You don't know the

02:10.240 --> 02:17.680
identity. Yep. And a ship. I guess that's short for a rocket ship or a spaceship. Okay.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.440
So we're not talking boats here. All right. We're not talking about boats. Very good. Now I'm

02:21.440 --> 02:30.800
moving on to our second phrase. The Enterprise lost its warp drive. Warp drive. Warp drive.

02:31.440 --> 02:37.520
So the warp drive of the Enterprise is actually something like an engine that allows it to

02:38.320 --> 02:42.960
go faster than the speed of light. So super fast. Super fast. But why warp?

02:43.680 --> 02:48.480
All right. Well if we take a look at the word warp, that actually means to bend.

02:48.560 --> 02:54.560
Yep. So like when you warp wood, it bends. Exactly. You bend wood or you warp metal.

02:55.360 --> 03:01.120
And well that's kind of the theory behind it is that they're going so fast that they bend or

03:02.000 --> 03:09.840
warp time. Okay. So warp drive. I think a very sci-fi specific phrase here. Right. All right.

03:09.840 --> 03:17.920
And for our third phrase today, search party. Search party. A search party. A search party.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.920
Okay. So what is this? Are we having a party? What what's going on? Well, when somebody gets lost.

03:24.720 --> 03:30.560
You know, maybe in the woods or something, you send out a search party to find them. So a party

03:30.560 --> 03:35.520
would be a group of people. Exactly. So that also happens in restaurants. I think right.

03:35.520 --> 03:39.680
Right. Sometimes you might say how many people in your party. And your party very good.

03:39.680 --> 03:44.640
So party group of people. All right. So in the dialogue, we saw that actually these were not

03:44.720 --> 03:50.000
real star track characters, but they were just acting. But it didn't sound quite right. Right.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.080
Yeah. He said that his voice is deeper. So a deep voice. Deep voice. All right. We're going to

03:58.080 --> 04:06.800
hear an example of what a deep voice sounds like. The one constant through all the years, Ray,

04:07.680 --> 04:14.480
has been faced both. Mark has ruled by like an army of steamrollers. It's been erased like a

04:14.480 --> 04:25.040
blackboard rebuilt in the wrist again. That is a deep voice. Now because his voice wasn't

04:25.040 --> 04:32.640
deep enough, he didn't sound authentic. Authentic. Authentic. All right. So authentic. Very easy word.

04:33.200 --> 04:40.000
Real. True to life. Real. True to life. Right. Not fake. Exactly. So Marco, is that an authentic

04:40.000 --> 04:49.760
Rolex? No, it's not. But thank you for noticing. All right. So authentic. And our last word for today.

04:50.400 --> 04:59.680
A wig. A wig. A wig. WIG. WIG. WIG. WIG. So a wig is pretend hair, right? Right. Fake hair. So the

04:59.760 --> 05:05.760
hair is not authentic. Very good. All right. So a wig. All right. We've got some great language here.

05:05.760 --> 05:10.240
And why don't we listen to it one more time? Slow down a little bit in the dialogue.

05:21.760 --> 05:27.840
Captain, we're under attack by an unidentified ship, damage report. We've sustained heavy

05:27.840 --> 05:33.280
damages to the endons. We've lost our warp drive. We'll have to attempt to make contact.

05:33.280 --> 05:39.200
This is Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise. We don't wish to engage. What is the

05:39.200 --> 05:46.080
nature of this attack? I am Captain Cole of the ship, Clothos. You're a ship attacked our

05:46.080 --> 05:52.720
search party. No, you're not doing it right. Corridor doesn't sound like that. His voice is deeper.

05:53.440 --> 06:01.280
I am Captain Cole of the ship, Clothos. Your ship. No. If you can't do an authentic

06:01.280 --> 06:08.640
clingon voice, I'll have to find a more serious Star Trek fan who can actually act. Okay. But

06:08.640 --> 06:16.320
but I already bought the clingon suit and the wig. All right. Now it's time for us to take a look at

06:16.320 --> 06:25.120
more phrases today in Fluency Builder. Fluency Builder. All right. So we've got some phrases here

06:25.120 --> 06:30.560
that you can use together with a number of different words, right? Exactly. So the first one. We

06:30.560 --> 06:37.680
heard that data said were under attack. We're under attack. Under attack. All right. So if we're under

06:37.680 --> 06:44.400
attack, it means that we are being attacked. Attack. Someone is shooting guns at you or trying to hurt

06:44.480 --> 06:49.680
you or something like that. Okay. So we are under attack. Very popular phrase that you would

06:49.680 --> 06:54.720
hear in war movies or something. Definitely. Now you can change this by changing the last word.

06:54.720 --> 07:00.800
We are under fire. Under fire, which basically means the same thing. Yeah. Except it. When you're

07:00.800 --> 07:07.280
under fire, there are guns involved. Okay. So they're shooting it. Yep. All right. We're under attack.

07:07.360 --> 07:14.960
We're under fire. All right. Moving on to our second phrase. We've sustained heavy damage.

07:14.960 --> 07:22.640
Sustain heavy damage. So when you sustain something, you receive it or you undergo this thing.

07:23.360 --> 07:30.000
So usually it's related to injury or to receiving some type of negative thing. Okay. So why don't

07:30.080 --> 07:37.040
we listen to some examples of how we could use sustain in context. Example one.

07:39.920 --> 07:46.240
John had a car accident and sustained a fatal injury. Example two.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.560
The boxer sustained a severe neck injury in the championship fight.

07:52.640 --> 08:03.040
Example three. Luckily the worship didn't sustain any serious damage.

08:06.080 --> 08:12.560
All right. So you see we typically sustain something like an injury or damage that is negative.

08:12.560 --> 08:21.520
Very good. And the last phrase for today. What is the nature of this attack? What is the nature of?

08:21.520 --> 08:26.800
What is the nature of? Okay. So basically he's just asking, why are you doing this?

08:27.680 --> 08:33.280
Right. Why? What is the reason? Yeah. What is the purpose? So again, we have some more examples

08:33.280 --> 08:39.840
of how you could use what is the nature of in different situations. Example one.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.760
What is the nature of your visits the United States?

08:46.640 --> 08:55.520
Example two. What is the nature of the threat against our country?

08:59.040 --> 09:05.360
Example three. The nature of my visit is personal.

09:08.800 --> 09:14.720
Okay. So a great phrase you can use not only when you're talking sci-fi but in everyday life. Exactly.

09:14.800 --> 09:20.320
So why don't we listen now to the dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

09:28.400 --> 09:34.240
Captain, we are under attack by an unidentified ship. Damage report. We've sustained heavy

09:34.240 --> 09:39.200
damages to the engines. We've lost our work drive. We'll have to attempt to make contact.

09:39.360 --> 09:47.840
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. We don't wish to engage.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.680
What is the nature of this attack?

09:49.680 --> 09:54.320
I've kept a core of the shipcultals. Your ship attacked our search party.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.400
No, you're not doing it right.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.360
Card doesn't sound like that. His voice is deeper.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.800
Oh, I've kept a core of the shipcultals.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.720
You're sure. If you can't do an authentic lingon voice,

10:06.720 --> 10:11.360
I'll have to find a more serious Star Trek fan who can actually act. Okay?

10:11.360 --> 10:15.520
What? What? I already fought the lingon soup and the wig fan.

10:19.360 --> 10:24.640
Well, Marko, I already admitted that I'm not much of a sci-fi fan. I don't really know anything

10:24.640 --> 10:29.840
about Star Trek or Star Wars. Well, it is a very popular show. I think it started around the

10:29.920 --> 10:36.880
60s or 70s. Yep. The first version of Star Trek. And well, many, many people follow it now.

10:36.880 --> 10:42.000
They dress up. They know the secret language that is used on the show. They know the spaceships.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.440
It's a big culture. That's true. And speaking of culture, I think we've got a Star Trek

10:47.440 --> 10:51.840
movie coming out pretty soon. So some of this language can help you guys understand it a little

10:51.840 --> 10:57.520
bit better. Very good. Yeah. So if you have any other questions or comments related to not

10:57.600 --> 11:02.400
only to science fiction, but anything in general, please come to the website EnglishPod.com

11:02.400 --> 11:07.120

Bye!
