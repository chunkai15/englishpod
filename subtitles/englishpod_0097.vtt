00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello English learners. Welcome back to English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
And I'm Erica. And today we are going to be talking about the weather.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
That's right. And you know, Marco, this is a really, really useful and important topic in English, isn't it?

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Exactly because if you ever travel abroad, you always want to know about the weather, right?

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
That's right. And Anglo people, English people, all they ever do is talk about the weather.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Well, it's an important topic. You want to know what clothes to wear or if you should take an umbrella.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Or even when you're making small talk with people. Exactly.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
So we are going to be taking a look at the weather in the United States.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
But before we get started with the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
The vocabulary preview. Okay. So we have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Now the first one is forecast.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Weather forecast. So this is what we listen to or what we see on the television, the weather forecast.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Right. It's like the prediction of the weather.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Okay. So forecast, can I only use it in the weather?

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
No. Of course, you can use it in many other different situations like in business, for example, forecast sales.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Okay. So the prediction of sales.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Very good. And we have one more word on vocabulary preview. A shower.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
A shower.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
So when it rains for a short time and it's not too heavy, that's a shower.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Okay. Very good. So it's very similar to a shower at home.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Right. It doesn't look a little bit of water.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
And it doesn't last too long. Okay. Very good.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue now.

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
We are going to be listening to the weatherman as he describes the weather in Utah.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
And now let's go to Kenny Williams for today's weather forecast.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Thank you Bill and good morning, Salt Lake City.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
What's the weather looking like today, Kenny?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
We've got heavy cloud coverage here in Northern Utah and we're calling for scattered showers throughout the day.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
With the daytime high at 45 degrees. Now, if we move down to the south of the state,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
we can see that a cold front is moving in.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
We can expect clear skies, but it will be quite cold with temperatures hovering around the 30 degree mark.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
It's a chilly day folks. So don't forget your coats.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
What about tomorrow, Kenny? Do you have good news for us?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Well, it'll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
We can expect some isolated downpours in the morning.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Winds will be coming in from the Northeast with gust reaching 23 miles per hour.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleep in the evening.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Things are looking a bit better for the south.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
We'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers later in the day.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
We can expect partly cloudy skies with a forecast high of 38 degrees.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
You heard it, folks. It's going to be a cold one. That's right, Bill.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
We'll have more later on today on the 6 o'clock news.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
That's the weather forecast for this morning.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
All right, so we listen to the weather forecast and it doesn't seem like nice weather in Utah, huh?

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
No, it certainly doesn't. I don't think that I'd really like to live there.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, maybe it's winter or something like that.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Well, I guess me, maybe it's good for skiing.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Okay, so now I think it's time for us to take a look at some of those that maybe

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
difficult words that we may have listened to in this dialogue in language takeaway.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Language takeaway.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
All right, here we're going to look at some words and phrases that you can use to describe the weather.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
Now, the first one we heard in the weather forecast that they were calling for scattered showers.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Scattered showers.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Scattered.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
If something is scattered, it's sort of like it's a little bit of that thing everywhere.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Okay, so and we already talked about what showers were.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Right, so showers are a small bit of a small amount of rain.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Okay, very good.

03:54.000 --> 04:03.000
To better understand that when something is scattered, imagine that we are in a playground and the children are playing in the playground.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Okay, so the children are scattered everywhere.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Some of them are playing on the swing.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Some of them are playing on the grass or in the sand box.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
So children a little bit of children in every different spot.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
So if we think that the city is a playground, maybe in one part of the city, there's a little bit of rain, but not in the other part.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Exactly.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
That's a scattered shower.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Very good.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Moving on to our second word, we have hovering.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Temperatures hovering around the 30 degree mark.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
The temperatures hovering around.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
Okay, so when I say that temperatures are hovering, you mean it's approximately.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Okay, so they can move up and down.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
So maybe it'll be a little bit warmer than 30 degrees or a little bit colder.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So if you think of hovering as floating.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Okay, very good.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
So why don't we listen to some more examples of how we could use hovering in different situations.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Example one.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
Unemployment rates are hovering around the 10% mark despite the government's attempts to stimulate the economy.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Example two.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
The weight is kept hovering around us all night.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
It was really annoying.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Example three.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
The company's margin this year is hovering around the 40% mark.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Okay, so pretty clear.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Hovering is sort of floating around one area.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Very good.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Now let's move on to the next part.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
We saw that we're going to have isolated downpours.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Isolated downpours.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Isolated downpours.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Okay, let's break this one down.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Let's start with downpour.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
A downpour is when you have a lot of rain.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Very strong rain.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
That's right.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
For maybe a short amount of time, it's really raining heavily.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Right.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
So that's what a downpour is.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
And if we take a look at the first word, isolated.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
So in one small area.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Okay, confined it to a specific area.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
That's right.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Okay, so we have an isolated downpour.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
It'll be raining in one specific area.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
And you hear this a lot with weather language.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
You hear isolated showers.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Isolated snowstorms.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Exactly.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
So it'll be in a specific area only.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
All right.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
So along with these showers and rain,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
we also talked about wind.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
And we heard that we will have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
So we're going to have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Guests of wind.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Okay.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
So can you explain to our listeners what gusts are?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Okay.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
So a gust is a sudden increase in the amount of wind.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Okay.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So maybe we will have normal wind.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
And all of a sudden it will get really windy.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
That's right.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
For a short amount of time.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Okay. That's a gust.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
G-U-S-T gust of wind.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And for our final word on language takeaway today,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
we're going to have sleet.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Sleet?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Oh, sleet.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
All right.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Sleet is a terrible kind of weather.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
It's sort of a mixture between snow and rain.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
So sleet is kind of the strange mix between ice and rain and snow.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
So just imagine it's not completely ice.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So it's not solid.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
But it's not water, right?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
It's not rain.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
And it's not snow either.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
No. It's in the middle.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Okay.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
All right. So sleet.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
What you really need to know is that it's terrible.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
All right. So that's all the words we have today for language takeaway.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Let's move on now to Fluency Builder.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Fluency Builder.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
All right.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
And Fluency Builder today.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
We're going to look at three phrases that are really common when you're talking about the weather.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
Now we heard in the dialogue that there was a cold front moving in.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
A cold front moving in.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
A cold front is moving in.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Okay. So a cold front.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Imagine a wall of cold air.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
And it comes towards a place and then it changes the pressure in the atmosphere.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
Okay. So a very sudden amount of cold air that comes into a place.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Right. So we say a cold front is moving in.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
So we always think of these cold fronts or warm fronts as moving.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
So you can either say they're moving in or you can say a cold front is coming in.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Okay. Very good.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
And okay. We have a cold front that's moving in.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
And we're going to have winds that will be coming in from the north east.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Okay. Winds coming in from.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay. Winds coming in from.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So when I say it's coming in from.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
You're talking about it's origin where it starts.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Okay.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
So if I change the noun and I say and I don't say winds anymore, but maybe I'll say my friends.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
My friends are coming in from Chicago.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So they are arriving from Chicago.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Exactly.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
What else can I say?

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Or you can also say the kids are coming in from outside.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Okay. So where they were before.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Very good. So coming in from.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
You can change the noun a little bit and you can form these new sentences.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Great.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Now our final phrase.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
We heard the announcer say it's going to be a cold one.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
It's going to be a cold one.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
It's going to be a cold one.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
So I have this phrase.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
It's going to be a cold one.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
What do I mean by a cold one?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Okay. So the one represents the event.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
So the day.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Okay.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
So it's going to be a cold day.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yes.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Okay.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Now we can obviously change the adjective, right?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
So it's going to be a hot one.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
It's going to be a long one.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
It's going to be a long day.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
All right.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
But the one can mean anything.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Okay. So it can be a day.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It can be an event meeting.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Okay.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
A project.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
So for example, if we're going to a meeting,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
this is going to be a hard one.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay. So the one represents the meeting.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
That's right.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
This is going to be a hard meeting.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
All right.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
I think this is a very good phrase.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
And it's very commonly used.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
So why don't we listen to some more examples of how we can use.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
It's going to be a something one.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Example one.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Temperatures of forecasted to hit 37 degrees today.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
It's going to be a hot one, folks.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Example two.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
It's only 8 a.m.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And I've got 100 emails already.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
It's going to be a long one today.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Example three.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I haven't studied at all for the exam.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
It's going to be a tough one.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Okay. So some great examples.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
And I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
And now we can understand all these words and phrases that we've just talked about.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
And now let's go to Kenny Williams for today's weather forecast.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Thank you Bill and good morning.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Salt Lake City.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
What's the weather?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
What can like today, Kenny?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
We've got heavy cloud cover here, Northern Utah.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And we're calling for scattered showers throughout the day.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
With the daytime high at 45 degrees.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Now, if we move down to the south of the state,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
we can see that a cold front is moving in.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
We can expect clear skies, but it will be quite cold with temperatures

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
hovering around the 30 degree mark.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
So chilly day folks.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
So don't forget your coats.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
What about tomorrow, Kenny?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Do you have good news for us?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Well, it'll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
We can expect some isolated downpours in the morning.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Winds will be coming in from the Northeast.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
We've gust reaching 23 miles per hour.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleep in the evening.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Things are looking a bit better for the south.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
We'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers later in the day.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
We can expect partly cloudy skies with a forecast high of 38 degrees.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
You heard it, folks.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
It's going to be a cold one.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
That's right, Bill.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
We will have more later on today on the 6 o'clock news.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
That's the weather forecast for this morning.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Okay, so we know that in English speaking countries,

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
the weather is always always a great subject of conversation for small talk, right?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Exactly.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
If you ever want to talk to somebody or start a conversation,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
the weather is always a number one topic.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Yep.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
And we actually have a phrase in this dialogue.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
They'll be great for starting a conversation.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Like, for example, imagine if you lived here in Utah

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
and you were wanting to start a conversation with someone,

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
you could say, it sure is a cold one today, isn't it?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Exactly.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
That's a great way of starting a conversation

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
and English speaking people love to talk about the weather, as you say.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
That's right.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
So, guys, if you have any questions about weather vocabulary,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
