00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to English pod, my name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
And today we have another great elementary lesson for you all.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
That's right, we've got a lesson for all you sports fans out there.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Alright, we're doing a podcast on sports today.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
We're starting off with basketball.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
So we've got lots of language about basketball and sports in this lesson today.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Great, so let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Two words for you today.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
The first one is foul foul foul foul.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
A foul.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Basically it's an action in a game that is not allowed.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Right, so if you're playing basketball and you kick the other player, that's a foul.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
That's a foul, that's a pretty big foul.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Yeah, if you're playing soccer and you pick up the ball.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
That's also a foul.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Huh?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Our second word is Reff.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Reff, R-E-F.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Also known as a referee, right?

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
So a referee is basically like the judge of a game.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
The judge of the game.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
So he's the one that will say that was a foul.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
That was a foul.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Reff.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Also known as referee.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Okay, so two great words.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
We're going to hear them in our dialogue.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
And we're going to be listening to two guys who are watching a basketball game on TV.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Good.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Good.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Good block out of Simon.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Hey, is the game started yet?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Who's running?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh, bulls, of course.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
What?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
That wasn't a foul.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I'll come on Reff.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Oh, sorry.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Shack always screws up free throws.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
You were right.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
He didn't make the shot.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah, that was a great shot.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Three-pointer.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Did you see that?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
He traveled to the Reff.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Didn't even call us.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Reff needs glasses.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Hey, Reff.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Open your eyes.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Can't believe it.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
See that.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Okay.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I did the first quarter.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
All right.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I'm going to make a beer run.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
All right.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
A really common situation.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Whenever you're watching games with friends, right?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
You need to get a beer.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
We'll talk about that in a minute.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
All right.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
A really common situation.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Whenever you're watching games with friends, right?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
You need to get a beer.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
We'll talk about that in a little while.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Let's take a look at language takeaway.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Language takeaway.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Okay.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Let's take a look at our first word on language takeaway.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Free throw.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Free throw.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Free throw.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Free throw.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
This one's a bit hard to say, isn't it?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
It's a little bit hard to explain.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
But if you're playing basketball,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
and if someone fouls you, you get a free throw.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
So that's when all the players line up around you.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
And you can throw the ball.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
To the basket without anyone blocking you or anything.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Right.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
A little bit complicated.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
But I'm sure the basketball fans understand what a free throw is.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
All right.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Our next word is...

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Make the shot.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Make the shot.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Make the shot.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Make the shot.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Let's listen to some examples,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
and we'll understand the meaning of

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
make the shot.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Example one.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I can't believe it.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
You made the shot from the other side of the court.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Example two.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Example two.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
There's no way he's going to make that shot.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
He's way too far away from the net.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Example three.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
If Gretsky makes a shot,

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
they're going to win the Stanley Cup.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
So it's clear now to make the shot

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
is to successfully make the ball in the basket.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
You can use this expression in other sports as well, right?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah, you can use it in hockey to make the shot.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
You can also use it in golf in a lot of different sports

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
that use the term to shoot.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yes, shoot the ball.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
So at any time you shoot the ball, you can make the shot.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Exactly.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Okay.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Our next word today.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Three pointer.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Three pointer.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Three pointer.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
It's a shot in basketball when you get three points.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Usually this shot is taken from further out.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah, a farther distance.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
So it's a little bit more difficult to make this shot.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
You know, sometimes people might say a three point shot

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
or something like that.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
But our English pot learners, they know.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
It's a three point.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
You'll sound really knowledgeable, really cool.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
You're not one.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Three pointer.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
And our last word today, travel.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Travel.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Travel.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
When you walk with the basketball.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Well, technically you're allowed to take two steps in basketball.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Okay.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
So when you take more than two steps in basketball.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
So yeah, traveling means to take more than two steps with the ball.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Let's listen to the dialogue a second time.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
This time it'll be a bit slower so that we can understand some of these great phrases we just talked about.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
Hey, has the game started yet?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
About five minutes ago.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Oh, who's winning?

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
The bulls, of course.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
What?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
That wasn't a foul.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Oh, come on, Raff.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Don't worry.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Shack always screws up free throws.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah, you were right.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
He didn't make this shot.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, that was a great shot.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Three pointer.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Yeah?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Oh, did you see that?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
He traveled and the Raff didn't even call it.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
This Raff needs glasses.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Hey, Raff.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Open your eyes.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I can't believe he didn't see that.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Okay.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Then to the first quarter.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Hey, I'm going to make a beer run.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Sweet.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Alright, sports fans.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Fluency Builder.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Okay.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Today on Fluency Builder, we have two really common words that you would listen to while you're watching a game.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah, these are sort of slangy words.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, they're kind of a common, like informal.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
And formal.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
The first one that we have is screw up.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Screw up.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Screw up.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Screw up.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Screw up.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
To screw up.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah, so this is a good way of saying to make a mistake.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Let's listen to some examples of how this word is used.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Example one.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Jill, you really screwed up this time.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
You're fired.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Example two.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
This game is important if you screw it up or out of the finals.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Example three.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm sorry.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I know I screwed up.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Let me forgive me.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay, so screw up is mess up.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, make a mistake.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Make a mistake.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Huh?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Great.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
And our last word on Fluency Builder today.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
A beer run.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
A beer run.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Beer run.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
So what is this beer run?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You run to get beer.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
You go to the store and get beer.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Okay.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
So it's just an expression to meaning to go and get more beer.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah, usually you're watching a game or you're at home with your friends.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
You run out of beer.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
So somebody has to make a get some beer.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Go get some beer.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Make a beer run.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Hey, is the game started yet?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah, about five minutes ago.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Who's winning goals, of course.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
What?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
That wasn't a foul.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Well, come on, Raff.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Sorry.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Shack always screws up free throws.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
You were right.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
He didn't make a shot.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, that was a great shot.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Three-pointer.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Did you see that?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
He traveled to the Raff.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Didn't even call us.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Raff needs glasses.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Hey, Raff, open your eyes.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Can't believe he didn't see that.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Okay.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Okay, guys, I hope you enjoyed our lesson today.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
We'll be bringing you more sports lessons in the future.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yes.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
So if you have a particular sport that you want to learn about, you can tell us.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
And we'll talk to our website, EnglishPod.com.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah, and leave us your comments or your suggestions or any doubts that you have.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
So we'll see you there.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yes.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Until next time.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Bye.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Bye.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Thank you.
