00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Hello, everyone. Welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod. My name is Maruko.

00:07.400 --> 00:14.000
And I'm Erica. And today we're going to be in one of my favorite sporting events, which is F1.

00:14.000 --> 00:22.800
F1 racing. Alright. So yeah, we're going to be talking about racing specifically F1, which is a very popular sport all over the world.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.300
Yeah, I think maybe it's like number two in popularity after soccer.

00:26.300 --> 00:29.800
Yeah, I think so. I have no numbers to back that up though.

00:30.100 --> 00:34.600
Well, they do travel everywhere. They have races all over the world and just people love it.

00:34.600 --> 00:40.300
So, well, it is kind of a cool thing. It will going 300 kilometers per hour in a car is pretty cool.

00:40.300 --> 00:45.800
Alright, so let's not delay this any longer. Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

00:45.800 --> 01:01.300
Welcome back racing fans. My name is Rick Field. And as always, I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Coblin.

01:01.300 --> 01:07.300
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race. And Kimi Reikonan is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

01:07.300 --> 01:12.300
They're heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Reikonan. It's our close one.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.300
Oh no! Hamilton hits the wall.

01:15.300 --> 01:21.300
He came into fast, jammed on the brakes and spun out. We have yellow flag and the pace car is making its way out of the track.

01:21.300 --> 01:25.300
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops.

01:25.300 --> 01:28.300
Reikonan is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

01:28.300 --> 01:32.800
Smoke is coming out of his car. He seems to be having edge of trouble. He makes his way out of the pit.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.800
And for none, no one knows what it takes to lead.

01:35.800 --> 01:41.800
How unlucky for Reikonan and this race is over the ladies and gentlemen, Alonzo takes the checkered flag.

01:51.800 --> 01:56.800
What an exciting race. I always love a good crash when it comes to car racers.

01:56.800 --> 02:03.800
I think many people go to races expecting to see a crash. They don't want to see people getting hurt.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.800
No, but a little bit of emotion of just car crashes.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.800
Yeah, a little explosion in there.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.800
All right, so now we saw some really exciting language related to racing.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.800
So why don't we look at that now in language takeaway?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.800
Language takeaway.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.800
All right, so we're talking about that crash.

02:24.800 --> 02:30.800
And I think what led to the crash was the driver jammed on the brakes.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.800
He jammed on the brakes to jam on the brakes.

02:34.800 --> 02:42.800
Okay, now if I jam on the brakes, you push the brakes really, really hard and really quickly and really suddenly.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.800
Right, so you jam on the brakes and you stop very quickly.

02:45.800 --> 02:53.800
So Lewis Hamilton jammed on the brakes and consequently spun out to spin out.

02:53.800 --> 02:58.800
Okay, in the present, it would be spin out spin out.

02:58.800 --> 03:04.800
Okay, so imagine yourselves driving your car on a very wet road.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.800
And then you jam on the brakes, right?

03:07.800 --> 03:11.800
So then the car, you kind of lose control of the car and it starts to spin.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.800
It goes in circles.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.800
That would be to spin out.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.800
This is actually happened to me more than once.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.800
Really?

03:18.800 --> 03:19.800
Yeah.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.800
Were you okay?

03:20.800 --> 03:21.800
Yeah, I was fine.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.800
Okay, so the car spun out.

03:24.800 --> 03:31.800
In racing, you always see this really cool car come out and be of head of everyone when there's an accident.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.800
Right, that's called the pace car.

03:33.800 --> 03:34.800
The pace car.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.800
pace car.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.800
Now why is it called the pace car?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.800
Because it sets the pace.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.800
Okay, the pace or the speed.

03:41.800 --> 03:42.800
So pace means speed.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.800
So this car comes out and no other car can pass it.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.800
Everyone must go at the same speed.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.800
Right, the pace car.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.800
All right, so after there's an accident, the clean up crew must come out.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.800
Okay, clean up crew.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.800
Clean up crew.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.800
All right, so crew, this is an interesting word.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.800
Hmm.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.800
When we talk about a crew, we talk about a group of people who work together.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.800
Okay, but for example, in an office, can I have a crew?

04:10.800 --> 04:11.800
Not really.

04:11.800 --> 04:12.800
Not commonly, right?

04:12.800 --> 04:15.800
Yeah, it's people who work together and they use their hands to work.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.800
They do manual labor.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.800
Okay, so I can save, for example, a construction crew.

04:20.800 --> 04:21.800
That's right.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.800
Or maybe the ground crew at the airport.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.800
Okay.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.800
Or the flight crew.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.800
Also at the airport.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.800
All right.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.800
Well, in the airplane.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.800
So that's a crew.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
So clean up crew.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.800
Clean up crew.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.800
Now they came out to take that car away that broke in or damaged vehicle.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.800
So they were towing it.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
To.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.800
Okay, the verb to toe.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.800
To toe.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.800
So what does it mean when you tow something or you tow a car?

04:47.800 --> 04:49.800
You pull something behind you.

04:49.800 --> 04:54.800
So if you're a truck that might pull a car behind you, that's a tow truck.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.800
A tow truck.

04:55.800 --> 05:00.800
Now this happens commonly if you park your vehicle where you are not supposed to.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.800
That's right.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.800
And your car will get towed.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.800
Your car gets towed.

05:04.800 --> 05:05.800
Very good.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.800
All right.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.800
So we saw five really great words related to racing.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.800
And now why don't we listen to our dialogue again.

05:13.800 --> 05:23.800
And then we'll look at some other interesting phrases.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.800
Welcome back, race fans.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.800
My name is Rick Fields.

05:27.800 --> 05:33.800
And as always, I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.800
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race.

05:36.800 --> 05:40.800
And Kimmy Raccoon in is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.800
They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikonin.

05:45.800 --> 05:49.800
It's a close one and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

05:49.800 --> 05:54.800
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes and spun out.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.800
We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track.

05:59.800 --> 06:04.800
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.800
Rikonin is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.800
Smoke is coming out of his car.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.800
He seems to be having engine trouble.

06:13.800 --> 06:19.800
He makes his way into the pit and Fernando Alonso takes the lead.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.800
How unlucky for Rikonin.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.800
And this race is over, ladies and gentlemen.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.800
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

06:29.800 --> 06:35.800
Okay, so now we're back and I think it's time for us to take a look at some phrases in Fluency Builder.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.800
Fluency Builder.

06:37.800 --> 06:43.800
Well, even though we're talking about F1 racing, a lot of the language can be used in many different situations.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.800
So let's look at some of those phrases now.

06:46.800 --> 06:53.800
When Rik fields introduced his co-host, he said, my partner in crime.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.800
Partner in crime.

06:55.800 --> 06:56.800
Partner in crime.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.800
Now, it's not that they're actually committing a crime.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.800
No, they're not actually bank robbers.

07:01.800 --> 07:06.800
But it's a very common and friendly way of saying, my good friend or my...

07:06.800 --> 07:08.800
The person I do everything with.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.800
Right, my co-worker.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.800
Yeah, but a co-worker who's a really, really good friend.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.800
Do you spend a lot of time with?

07:14.800 --> 07:16.800
Okay, so that's your partnering crime.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.800
It's just a metaphor, right?

07:18.800 --> 07:19.800
So partner in crime.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.800
Now, what about the next phrase?

07:21.800 --> 07:23.800
The last stretch.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.800
The last stretch.

07:25.800 --> 07:26.800
Last stretch.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.800
Okay, before we explain this word,

07:29.800 --> 07:33.800
let's listen to some examples and then we'll come back and talk about it.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.800
Example one.

07:35.800 --> 07:39.800
We have finally in the last stretch of a very long week.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.800
I can't wait to go home.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.800
Example two.

07:43.800 --> 07:49.800
He's in the last stretch of his college years and soon, he'll graduate.

07:49.800 --> 07:55.800
Okay, so I understand that to mean like the final length of time, right?

07:55.800 --> 07:59.800
The last or final moments before an ending.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.800
All right, so the last stretch.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.800
The last stretch.

08:02.800 --> 08:07.800
Now, when you're on the last stretch, you just have a few minutes to go.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
To go.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.800
Yeah, to go.

08:09.800 --> 08:13.800
Now, this preposition two and the verb go is very easy, right?

08:13.800 --> 08:14.800
Right.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.800
But if you say five minutes to go, what does that mean?

08:17.800 --> 08:18.800
Five minutes left.

08:18.800 --> 08:19.800
Left.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.800
Yeah.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.800
It doesn't mean it's five minutes to actually leave, right?

08:22.800 --> 08:23.800
Right.

08:23.800 --> 08:27.800
No, it means you must complete five minutes before you can be finished.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.800
Okay, so it's not about exiting.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.800
Right.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.800
Five days to go before I go on vacation.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.800
So it's not about you actually going on the vacation.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.800
It's about you passing those five days.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.800
Can you give us another example?

08:41.800 --> 08:45.800
How about we have 45 minutes to go before the end of the day?

08:45.800 --> 08:46.800
That's right.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.800
So to go.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.800
Left.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.800
Exactly to go.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.800
All right, now let's take a look at our last phrase.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.800
Close one.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
A close one.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.800
A close one.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.800
All right.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.800
Another interesting phrase made up of simple words.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.800
So let's listen to some examples to help us understand it.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.800
Example one.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
That was a close one.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.800
The teacher always caught me cheating.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.800
Example two.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.800
It's a close one.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.800
We are tied.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.800
And the game is almost over.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.800
Example three.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.800
My girlfriend almost found the presence I hit under the bed.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.800
It was a close one.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.800
Okay.

09:32.800 --> 09:33.800
So a close one.

09:33.800 --> 09:37.800
It means a situation that is almost dangerous.

09:37.800 --> 09:38.800
But wasn't.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.800
Yeah.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
Exactly.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.800
That was a close one.

09:41.800 --> 09:42.800
Okay.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.800
So very good phrases.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.800
I think we can take a lot from this and apply it outside of F1, right?

09:47.800 --> 09:48.800
Yeah.

09:48.800 --> 09:49.800
All right.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.800
So let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.800
And then we'll come back and talk about this great sport.

09:54.800 --> 10:04.800
Welcome back racing fans.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.800
My name is Rick Field.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.800
And as always, I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Coblin.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.800
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.800
And Kimmy Rikonin is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.800
They're heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikonin.

10:18.800 --> 10:19.800
It's our close one.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.800
Oh no.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
Hamilton hits the wall.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.800
Come into fast, jammed on the brakes and spun out.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.800
We have yellow flag and the pace car is making its way to the track.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.800
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.800
Rickonin is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.800
Smoke is coming out of his car.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.800
He seems to be having engine trouble.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.800
He makes his way out of the pit.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.800
And for none, no one knows what takes the lead.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.800
How unlucky for Rikonin.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.800
And this race is over the ladies and gentlemen.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
Alonzo takes the checkered flag.

10:48.800 --> 11:03.800
All right, so F1 Racing, Erica, do you like it?

11:03.800 --> 11:04.800
Do you like it?

11:04.800 --> 11:07.800
Yeah, F1 is pretty neat.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
Cars that drive fast.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.800
That's pretty interesting.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.800
Well, for some people, it is.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.800
Why do I want to go to a race and just see fast cars?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.800
Okay, I would never go to a race, but I think it's.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.800
I would maybe watch the highlights on TV.

11:21.800 --> 11:25.800
Well, actually this year it's really exciting because again, we're going to have a night race.

11:25.800 --> 11:30.800
I think it's in Malaysia or somewhere in Asia that they're going to race at night.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.800
Oh, so that's pretty special.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.800
Well, it's like harder to see and you're going really fast.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.800
All right.

11:36.800 --> 11:37.800
All right.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.800
So I hear you're going to the F1 this year.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.800
Yes, this year I'm going to go to the Shanghai Circuit to watch the F1 race.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.800
So I'm really excited about that.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.800
I haven't ever been to one.

11:45.800 --> 11:46.800
So it should be fun.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.800
All right.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.800
Well, I hope you get to see some interesting things.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.800
Like car crashes and it's pace cars.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.800
Yeah.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.800
What about you guys?

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
Our listeners.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.800
Are you fans of F1?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.800
Have you ever been to an F1 race?

11:58.800 --> 11:59.800
Exactly.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.800

12:17.800 --> 12:18.800
Any Canadian race car drivers?

12:18.800 --> 12:19.800
Oh, yeah.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.800
There was one recently.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.800
Someone's something.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.800
All right.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.800
Maybe that users know which one is the Canadian.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.800
So we'll see you guys there.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.800

Bye.
