Hello English learners. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.800
And I'm Erica.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.840
And today we have a special lesson for all of you who are looking for a new apartment or house.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.320
Or even if you're not looking for an apartment, this lesson will be useful because it can help you

00:16.320 --> 00:19.760
describe what your current apartment or house looks like.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.360
That's right, so we're going to be describing an apartment and another vocabulary related to

00:23.360 --> 00:27.280
apartment hunting. Why don't we take a look at some of the first words that we have in

00:27.280 --> 00:29.680
vocabulary preview?

00:29.680 --> 00:36.560
The vocabulary preview. We're going to hear these two words in the dialogue. The first one is

00:36.560 --> 00:42.960
landlord. Landlord. Landlord. All right, so who is a landlord? What is a landlord?

00:42.960 --> 00:47.200
What's pretty simple? A landlord is the person who owns the house.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.640
Okay. Or apartments. So the owner of the house.

00:50.640 --> 00:56.320
Right. And a landlord rents out the apartment to the tenants.

00:56.320 --> 01:02.800
Okay. Very good tenants. Tenants. So the tenants are the people that are renting the apartment or house.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.920
Exactly. Two important words that we'll find in the dialogue. Tenants and landlord.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.960
So why don't we take a listen to the dialogue now? And we'll hear as a couple is checking out a new apartment.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.120
Hi. We are the Christian since. We're here to see the apartment.

01:23.120 --> 01:28.320
Oh, hi. Short. Come on in. Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated.

01:28.320 --> 01:32.960
The previous tenants left a huge mess here. So the landlord has done everything.

01:32.960 --> 01:40.880
It looks great. It's so bright and airy. What great light. I really love these hardwood floors.

01:41.520 --> 01:47.360
What's the square footage of this place? Well, it's about 120 square meters or

01:48.320 --> 01:53.760
1300 square feet more or less. Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.

01:53.760 --> 01:59.440
There's a new dishwasher and a professional grade gas range. Really at this price. This place is an amazing

01:59.440 --> 02:04.080
deal. I love it. But wait. What are the payment terms?

02:05.280 --> 02:09.920
First and last month, rent as the deposit and rent is due on the first of every month.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.880
Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal.

02:14.960 --> 02:20.880
Yes, it is. It's a good to be true. The living room and dining room are quite spacious, as you can see.

02:20.880 --> 02:26.080
And down this hall, here's the master bedroom. It has a huge walking closet and a

02:26.080 --> 02:33.280
and sweet bathroom. We can't go in there yet as the police, uh, I mean the cleanup crew hasn't finished yet.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.720
Oh, what do you mean? What's in here?

02:44.960 --> 02:59.840
All right, so apparently the apartment was too good to be true. Yeah, I don't think that's exactly

02:59.840 --> 03:05.280
what they were expecting to find in the bathroom. Exactly. Well, we did find a lot of great

03:05.280 --> 03:09.520
words and phrases, so why don't we take a look at that now in language takeaway?

03:09.760 --> 03:18.320
Language takeaway. We're just going to look at a bunch of vocabulary items related to

03:18.880 --> 03:24.160
apartments and house hunting. So we've got a lot to cover here, so let's get started with the first one.

03:25.040 --> 03:34.320
Renovated renovated renovated. Right, so in the apartment was newly renovated. Okay, so the

03:34.320 --> 03:39.760
verb to renovate. Uh, great word, and I think some examples will help us understand the meaning.

03:41.040 --> 03:48.640
Example one. I had to renovate my kitchen because I accidentally burned everything while clicking.

03:51.760 --> 03:58.800
Example two. The city recently renovated the ceiling of the local church.

03:59.760 --> 04:11.600
Example three. John is planning on renovating his nightclub so as to make it more modern.

04:15.200 --> 04:21.040
Okay, so basically two renovate means to make new again. Right, when you renovate a house or an

04:21.040 --> 04:27.280
apartment, you, you know, take everything down and build it back up again. Okay, so it's usually only

04:27.360 --> 04:33.520
used for buildings for apartments for houses or offices. You don't say you renovate your computer.

04:33.520 --> 04:38.720
Yeah, and also when you just do something really simple, like change the paint color,

04:38.720 --> 04:43.600
that's not a renovation. Okay. That's redecoration. When you renovate, you have to like,

04:43.600 --> 04:50.800
you know, use a hammer and saw and lots of tools. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so the apartment was newly renovated

04:50.880 --> 04:58.480
and it was bright and airy. Airy. Airy. All right, so airy. Well, I guess we understand the word

04:58.480 --> 05:05.120
air. Yeah. So if an apartment or something is airy, it has lots of space, lots of place to move around.

05:05.120 --> 05:10.960
Okay, so it's wide. It's open. It's open. Okay. Yeah, an open apartment. Very good.

05:11.840 --> 05:18.400
Now for our next word, an important question she asked for the square footage, square footage,

05:19.200 --> 05:27.760
the square footage of the apartment. Okay, so we know square foot, right? So feet like a measure of space.

05:27.760 --> 05:33.760
Right. Uh, the square footage is just basically the area. How big? Okay, so why don't we

05:33.760 --> 05:39.200
listen to some examples of how we can use these two words square footage in a sentence?

05:40.400 --> 05:47.840
Example one. As a civil engineer, I have to calculate the square footage of the

05:47.920 --> 06:00.480
construction site. Example two. Robert is worried that the square footage of this land is not big enough.

06:04.080 --> 06:11.600
Example three. If you multiply the width of the room by the length, you will have the square

06:11.680 --> 06:18.080
footage of the room. Those are some great examples. And I find this, uh, the ending of this word,

06:18.080 --> 06:23.760
edge, foot edge. It's interesting, isn't it? Yeah, I guess you can only use it with the imperial system.

06:23.760 --> 06:30.720
Hmm. So you can also say, tonnage, right? So how, how big, how heavy, or mileage.

06:30.720 --> 06:36.160
mileage, right? But you can't say, for example, in meters, you wouldn't say,

06:36.720 --> 06:42.560
No, you can't say that, right? Yeah. So it's not for the metric system. It's only for some units of measurement

06:42.560 --> 06:49.520
in the imperial system. Exactly. All right. So after we've measured the square footage of the apartment,

06:49.520 --> 06:56.160
we saw that they had new appliances. Appliances. Appliances. Appliances. Appliances.

06:57.200 --> 07:02.400
So kitchen appliances. What are those? Machines that do stuff in the kitchen. All right. So a blender,

07:02.480 --> 07:10.720
a stove, a microwave. Yeah. Or I can say electric appliances. So like your TV, um, an iron, uh, vacuum cleaner.

07:10.720 --> 07:18.000
Okay. So appliance can be any type of machine that's used in a house in a house. Yeah. And well,

07:18.000 --> 07:24.960
one of these appliances was a professional grade gas range. Okay. This is a great phrase, and I want to

07:24.960 --> 07:32.320
break it down. So a gas range. Now this is basically a stove, right? Okay. Um, that's that you

07:32.320 --> 07:38.560
use as gas instead of electricity. So I can have an electric range. Exactly. Now professional

07:38.560 --> 07:44.720
grades. This is something that's really high quality. So if it's high quality, why do we say it's

07:44.720 --> 07:50.640
professional grade? Because it's so good that professionals use it. Okay. So can I only have

07:50.640 --> 07:55.840
professional grade kitchen appliances? No, of course not. You can have a professional grade anything,

07:55.840 --> 08:02.160
like a professional grade carpet, for example. Okay. Or a professional grade pickup truck. Mm-hmm.

08:02.320 --> 08:06.640
Or you can even change this a little bit and say industrial grade. So after we see

08:06.640 --> 08:13.360
all the appliances, they describe the house as spacious spacious. The house is very spacious. Pretty

08:13.360 --> 08:18.960
easy. We know the word space here, right? Right? So obviously this means lots of space. It has lots

08:18.960 --> 08:23.920
of space. Yeah. So I guess maybe spacious and area a little bit similar, right? Yeah. Mm-hmm.

08:23.920 --> 08:30.880
Okay. And of course, once we were in the master bedroom, we saw that they had a walk in closet.

08:30.880 --> 08:38.000
A walk in closet. Walk in closet. A walk in closet. Right. So this is very easy. I guess walk in.

08:38.640 --> 08:43.520
You can walk into it. Right. And so it's a huge closet, right? Yeah. It's now just a note on the

08:43.520 --> 08:51.120
spelling here. Walk in are hyphenated. Okay. Walk in closet. Mm-hmm. Very good. And apart from this

08:51.120 --> 08:57.840
beautiful closet, we had an on-sweet bathroom. On-sweet bathroom. On-sweet bathroom. For another

08:57.840 --> 09:05.920
note on the spelling here. It's E-N. Right. Hyphen S-U-I-T-E. So even though it's E-N, we pronounce it like an

09:05.920 --> 09:13.360
O-N. Yep. On-sweet. So an on-sweet bathroom is a bathroom inside the room. Okay. Inside the master bedroom.

09:13.360 --> 09:19.040
Mm-hmm. Very good. On-sweet bathroom. So a lot of great words describing the the apartments

09:19.040 --> 09:24.400
and also other aspects of real estate. So why don't we listen to these one more time in context.

09:24.400 --> 09:36.320
And we'll see how they fit together to describe an apartment. Hi. We are the Christian since.

09:36.320 --> 09:41.760
We're here to see the apartment. Oh, hi. Short. Come on in. Well, as you can see the places just

09:41.760 --> 09:47.200
been renovated, the previous tenants left a huge mess here. So the landlord has done everything.

09:47.840 --> 09:55.280
It looks great. It's so bright and airy. What great light. I really love these hardwood floors.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.760
What's the square footage of this place? Well, it's about 120 square meters or

10:02.800 --> 10:08.400
1,300 square feet more or less. Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances. There's

10:08.400 --> 10:13.840
a new dishwasher and a professional grade gas range. Really at this price, this place is an amazing

10:14.320 --> 10:18.480
deal. I love it. But wait. What are the payment terms?

10:19.680 --> 10:25.440
First and last month, rent as the deposit and rent is due on the first of every month. Considering

10:25.440 --> 10:31.920
the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal. Yes, it is. It's a good to be true.

10:31.920 --> 10:36.560
The living room and dining room are quite spacious as you can see. And down this hall,

10:36.560 --> 10:41.600
here's a master bedroom. It has a huge walking closet and an ensuite bathroom.

10:42.240 --> 10:47.680
We can't go in there yet as the police, uh, I mean the cleanup crew hasn't finished yet.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.120
Oh, what do you mean? What's in here?

11:03.280 --> 11:09.760
All right, so this is always kind of difficult to look for a new apartment and to go and see them.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.360
But it's interesting here. They were renting and they had a real estate agent.

11:13.360 --> 11:18.320
Yeah, um, and actually this is very uncommon in America, isn't it?

11:18.320 --> 11:22.880
Yeah, I guess you don't really use a real estate agent unless you're going to buy a house

11:22.880 --> 11:27.360
apartment. Mm-hmm. So when you're renting, you just go and look by yourself. Right. You can find

11:27.360 --> 11:32.720
ads in the newspaper on the internet and deal directly with the landlord. Right. So after you've

11:32.720 --> 11:38.560
done your house hunting and found your apartment, um, you got to set up the payment conditions.

11:38.640 --> 11:43.680
Right. Like we saw in the dialogue, the payment terms were first and last month's rent as the

11:43.680 --> 11:48.480
posit. Mm-hmm. So that's basically they'll keep that just in case you damage something in the

11:48.480 --> 11:54.480
apartment. Or have a monster living in your bathroom? Exactly. And another thing is that I've noticed

11:54.480 --> 12:00.960
in some countries, you pay rent in advance. Right. So in America, you only pay, um, one month's rent

12:00.960 --> 12:06.800
at a time, right? Right. So I guess this is an interesting topic real estate and apartment hunting

12:06.880 --> 12:11.920
and renting is different in different countries. So that's where you guys need to come and tell

12:11.920 --> 12:17.680
us how is, how does this work in your country? You can also use some of the vocabulary in this

12:17.680 --> 12:22.640
dialogue to tell us about your apartment. Right. How many rooms do you have bedrooms, dining rooms?

12:22.640 --> 12:28.160
What's the square footage? Exactly. Or how many square meters, right? Yep. So check out our website,

12:28.160 --> 12:33.840
EnglishPod.com. All right. And we'll see you guys there. Thanks for listening and until next time.

12:33.840 --> 12:42.880
Goodbye.
