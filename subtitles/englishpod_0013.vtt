00:00.000 --> 00:06.760
Hello everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod, my name's Erica, and I'm Marco.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.520
So, Marco, how are you doing today?

00:08.520 --> 00:14.400
I'm great, I'm really happy to be back ready to deliver another great podcast for all our listeners.

00:14.400 --> 00:19.760
That's right, and we've got an intermediate lesson today about spending money.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.760
Yes, specifically spending money in a company.

00:22.760 --> 00:29.600
That's right, we're going to be listening to a business meeting as a company describes how they're spending money.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.080
Right, and they're actually looking at their profit and lost statement.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.920
So, what kind of interesting?

00:34.920 --> 00:38.880
Well, Marco, can you tell us a little bit about a profit and lost statement?

00:38.880 --> 00:45.920
Uh, yeah, sure, well, all companies come out with a profit and lost statement every year or every three months.

00:45.920 --> 00:53.520
And it's basically a document that shows all the money that the company is spending and all the money that the company is earning.

00:53.520 --> 00:59.000
So, it's a document that outlines how much money the company makes and how much it is.

00:59.960 --> 01:04.040
Right, so in the end, basically, it'll tell you we're making money or we're losing money.

01:04.040 --> 01:10.320
Okay, so we're going to be listening to some people discuss a profit and lost statement in just a moment.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.760
But before we do that, it's time for vocabulary preview.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.760
Very cablory preview.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.320
Okay, great, so today on our vocabulary preview, we have two words for you.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.800
So, let's take a look at the first one.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.640
Expenses.

01:25.640 --> 01:26.640
Expenses.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.920
Expenses.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.280
Expenses.

01:29.280 --> 01:34.480
So, expenses are things that you have to spend money on regularly.

01:34.480 --> 01:45.120
Right, so for example, in a company, regular company expenses are salaries or office supplies or the phone bills, internet bills.

01:45.120 --> 01:50.960
Okay, and maybe in a household or a family, your expenses might be your food.

01:50.960 --> 01:56.080
Perhaps your transportation or your rent or your heating bills.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.280
So, these are all things you spend money on regularly.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.880
There are expenses.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.400
Expenses, great.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.000
Let's take a look at our second word through the roof.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.440
Through the roof.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.640
Through the roof.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.720
Through the roof.

02:10.720 --> 02:15.040
So, when something is through the roof, it's really, really, really, really high.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.640
Really high.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.400
So, for example, we can talk about gas prices.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.840
Are through the roof lately.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.040
Yeah, that's totally true.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.680
Gas prices have gone really high in the past couple of months.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.520
So, when we talk about through the roof, it means that the number is really high.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.880
That's right, we typically use this word with numbers.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.400
It also gives you the idea that the number has risen really quickly.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.840
Yeah, exactly.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.680
Okay, so through the roof.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.720
Through the roof.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.120
All right, Marco, do you think it's time for the dialogue?

02:45.120 --> 02:46.720
Yep, let's listen to the dialogue.

02:46.720 --> 02:51.520
As always, the first dialogue is going to be a little bit fast, so it might be a little bit difficult.

02:52.160 --> 02:58.000
Don't worry if you don't understand everything because we will explain all of the key language in a minute.

03:02.240 --> 03:06.880
Okay, so now the last point on our agenda, Jill, let's go over the profit in last statement.

03:07.760 --> 03:08.960
Great.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.600
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.720
These numbers are off the charts.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.480
What's going on here?

03:18.480 --> 03:24.560
Well, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.320
Look at these bills, for example.

03:26.320 --> 03:31.200
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.240
Okay, thank you.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.200
I'll look into it.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.440
The list goes on and on.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.800
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatment.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.800
Thank you, that will be all.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.000
I'll take care of it.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.200
Look at this one, sir.

03:43.200 --> 03:48.000
$8,000 were expense in one night at a place called Wild Thing.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.120
Okay, I get it.

03:49.120 --> 03:52.320
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.080
Okay, so this accountant.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.280
She's a pretty thorough, hey?

04:01.280 --> 04:06.480
She's really persistent about her job and the manager apparently is a little bit embarrassed.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.920
I wonder why that could be.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.040
Well, we'll talk about that in a little while.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.920
Why don't we take a look at our language takeaway for today?

04:15.760 --> 04:16.960
Language takeaway.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.480
In today's language takeaway, we're going to look at three words.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.000
And the first word is expenditures.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.200
Expendatures.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.720
Expendatures.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.480
Expendatures.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.600
So expenditures sounds pretty close to expenses, right?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.560
It's pretty similar, but it has a little bit of a difference.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.920
So why don't we listen to some examples and see if we can understand?

04:43.120 --> 04:44.080
Example one.

04:45.040 --> 04:51.520
If you're elected president, I will increase expenditures on health and education by 12%.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.600
Example two.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.240
We really need to control our travel expenditures.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.120
From now on, all managers will fly economy class.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.120
Example three.

05:09.120 --> 05:17.520
Because of the rise in oil prices, expenditures on food are higher than they have ever been.

05:20.640 --> 05:25.760
So expenditures is the total amount of money that you're spending on something.

05:25.760 --> 05:31.440
Right, that's the total amount of money versus expenses is the things that you spend money on.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.640
Okay, that's really clear.

05:33.280 --> 05:38.480
Our next word is, out of control.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.840
Out of control.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.960
Out of control.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.440
So when something is out of control, it's crazy.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.800
Crazy, you can control it.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.240
Exactly, you can't stop it.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.200
You can't stop it.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.480
Out of control.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.440
Okay, great.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.680
Now let's take a look at our last word for today.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.360
Go over.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.400
Go over.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.240
Go over.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.040
Go over.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.200
So go over is a pretty simple word.

06:01.280 --> 06:05.520
Why don't we listen to some example so we can understand go over.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.920
Example one.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.960
I need to go over this report one last time to make sure there are no mistakes.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.160
Example two.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.320
Can you help me go over my presentation?

06:22.320 --> 06:24.000
I want to make sure it's perfect.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.320
Example three.

06:32.160 --> 06:36.240
Let's go over these numbers one more time and make sure there are no mistakes.

06:39.840 --> 06:45.120
Yeah, this is a really common word and it basically means look at carefully.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.400
Yeah, or review.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.960
In English, we often find simple little words.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.960
They fit together really well.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.040
And you think, oh, they're so easy.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.960
Like the word go over.

06:54.960 --> 06:55.680
So easy.

06:56.480 --> 06:56.800
Yeah.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.280
But it's the way that they interact with each other.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.960
That makes them or it makes you sound much better.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.520
Exactly.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.360
So go over in this case.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.160
We might say, let's go over the lesson.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.200
Let's go over the lesson.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.560
Yeah, that sounds great.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.640
Yeah, that's and that's a more natural way of saying something like that.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.920
Okay, so we've taken look at our language takeaways for today.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.040
I think it's time to listen to the dialogue one more time.

07:21.040 --> 07:26.560
And this time the dialogue will be slower so we can understand and listen to all the words we just

07:27.440 --> 07:36.560
talked about.

07:38.240 --> 07:43.040
Okay, so now the last point on our agenda.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.480
Jill, let's go over the profit and lost statement.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.560
Great.

07:48.560 --> 07:55.840
Well, the main issue here as you can see is that our expenses are through the roof.

07:57.040 --> 08:01.760
Let's see these numbers are off the charts.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.040
What's going on here?

08:03.840 --> 08:12.320
Well, um, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.120
Look at these bills, for example.

08:15.120 --> 08:22.240
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.160
Okay, thank you.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.200
I'll look into it.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.600
The list goes on and on here.

08:29.600 --> 08:34.800
This is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatments.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.840
Thank you.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.200
That will be all.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.640
I'll take care of it.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.160
Look at this one, sir.

08:40.880 --> 08:47.840
$8,000 were expense in one night at a place called wild things.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.200
Okay, I get it.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.800
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.960
Okay, so I got it.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.080
Yeah, it's clear now.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.080
Yeah, and you know, I heard a lot of really great phrases in this dialogue.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.200
But I'd like to look at now in Fluency Builder.

09:12.640 --> 09:13.600
Fluency Builder.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.280
Great, so today on Fluency Builder, we have three words for you.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.880
Let's start by looking at the first one.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.960
Off the charts.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.320
Off the charts.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.600
Off the charts.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.960
Off the charts.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.320
So this word is very similar to the roof.

09:28.320 --> 09:28.960
Exactly.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.960
It also means really high.

09:30.960 --> 09:34.400
Right, so let's listen to some examples of how we can use

09:34.400 --> 09:36.640
off the charts in a different situation.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.640
Example one.

09:41.680 --> 09:46.800
Oil prices have gone up and our costs are off the charts.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.560
Example two.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.480
Excellent job Susan, your sales are off the charts this year.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.320
Example three.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.960
Our losses are off the charts.

10:04.960 --> 10:05.760
That's it.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.280
No bonuses for anyone.

10:10.080 --> 10:15.040
So Marco, do you think I can change off the charts for through the roof

10:15.040 --> 10:15.920
in these examples?

10:16.640 --> 10:17.600
Yeah, you can.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.400
Definitely, you can use off the charts or through the roof.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.000
Both of them mean the same thing.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Okay, so two ways of saying really, really, really high, really high.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.320
But they're very commonly used in a business setting.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.200
Yeah, that's true.

10:29.200 --> 10:34.160
Okay, so this next word is a phrase that you can use if you want to tell somebody

10:34.160 --> 10:38.000
that you'll check something or you'll investigate something.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Right, and we heard it in our dialogue.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.600
So let's listen to the clip.

10:42.720 --> 10:43.680
I look into it.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.160
I look into it.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.160
So look into that.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.920
That means I'll check something.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.920
Yeah, I'll see what's happening.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.760
Yeah, does it mean you're going to take action?

10:54.400 --> 10:55.600
No, it doesn't.

10:55.600 --> 11:00.160
Okay, so I think we've got another word that does mean you're going to take action.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.040
I'll take care of it.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.200
I'll take care of it.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.920
So this word means that you're going to do something about it.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.040
I'll take care of it.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.880
I will take responsibility.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.440
Exactly.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.960
So I will do something about it.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.120
Yeah, we'll investigate and I'll do it.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.440
Yeah, again, two great phrases.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.480
I'll look into it.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.680
I'll take care of it.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.040
Okay, so now let's listen to the dialogue a third time.

11:25.040 --> 11:30.640
It's going to be at its normal speed, but now you have all the tools you need to understand it a lot better.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.960
Okay, so now the last point on our agenda, Jill, let's go over the profit and last statement.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.400
Great.

11:42.960 --> 11:47.600
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.800
These numbers are off the charts.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.600
What's going on here?

11:52.320 --> 11:58.480
Well, um, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.320
Look at these bills, for example.

12:00.320 --> 12:05.040
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.320
Oh, okay, thank you.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.200
I'll look into it.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.840
The list goes on and on here.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.880
This is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatment.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.760
Thank you.

12:13.760 --> 12:14.880
That will be all.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.080
I'll take care of it.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.280
Look at this one, sir.

12:17.280 --> 12:22.080
$8,000 were expense in one night at a place called wild thing.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.200
Okay, I get it.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.400
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

12:31.840 --> 12:37.120
Well, Marko, I guess one of the benefits of being an executive in a company,

12:37.120 --> 12:42.160
especially a large company as you get a lot of amazing benefits.

12:42.160 --> 12:46.880
Yes, when you are a manager or a CEO of one of these big companies,

12:46.880 --> 12:51.440
you get a lot of great things like, I don't know, a private jet, maybe.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.800
Well, that's that's nice, huh?

12:53.760 --> 12:57.520
Or um, the company often pays for your house.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.240
Yeah.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.280
Or for your car, they'll give you a company car.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.960
They'll pay for your kids or your children's tuition for high school,

13:06.960 --> 13:08.400
so there's school fees.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.040
Yeah, yeah.

13:09.040 --> 13:09.680
Okay.

13:09.680 --> 13:13.040
And also, I've heard about entertainment bonuses.

13:13.040 --> 13:13.920
Yeah.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.200
So you can go out to a restaurant, get the receipt,

13:17.200 --> 13:19.920
and claim the expenses at work.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.760
Those are some great benefits, right?

13:21.760 --> 13:27.360
So, Marko, I'm curious to know what our listeners' expenses are.

13:27.360 --> 13:31.680
Yes, we definitely want to know what crazy expenses you have, for example.

13:32.560 --> 13:37.680
Well, let's see, my spending on Coke Zero has gone through the roofs,

13:37.680 --> 13:39.920
since we started this podcast.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.840
Yes, you spend a lot of money on Coke Zero's every week, right?

13:43.840 --> 13:46.080
Yeah, I probably have a, I don't know, 10 a week.

13:47.360 --> 13:52.000
Well, for example, I spend a lot on DVDs each week.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.920
I usually buy two or three movies.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.160
That is off the chart.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.120
That is off the charts for DVD spending.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.360
So we want to know what you spend your money on.

14:01.360 --> 14:06.720

14:06.720 --> 14:10.480
