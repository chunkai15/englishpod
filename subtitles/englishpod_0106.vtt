Hello English learners. Welcome back to another podcast with us here at English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:07.600 --> 00:16.240
I'm Erica. And today we're going to be looking at a very popular topic. Something that everyone has to do at least once in their life.

00:16.240 --> 00:22.560
That's right. We're talking about mobile phones and getting a mobile phone plan.

00:22.560 --> 00:29.600
Right. So you have a mobile phone, you need to get a plan or you need to do something in order to make it work, right?

00:29.600 --> 00:33.840
Yes. And in this lesson, we're going to learn some language to help you do that.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.040
All right. So let's start with the language on vocabulary preview.

00:38.080 --> 00:45.680
Very cablory preview. In the dialogue, we're going to compare two types of mobile phone plans.

00:45.680 --> 00:52.400
The prepaid plan and the monthly rate plan. Okay. So we have two types of plans prepaid.

00:53.200 --> 01:01.840
prepaid plan. Okay. A prepaid plan. Well, a prepaid plan. Basically, just like the name suggests,

01:01.840 --> 01:10.000
you pay before you use the minutes. So you maybe you have to buy a card and then you can use maybe 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 100 minutes.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.040
Exactly. And then when you run out of money or you use all your minutes, you can buy another card and like that.

01:17.520 --> 01:24.400
Yeah. But the monthly rate plan is different. So the monthly rate plan you have to pay each month.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.600
Right. At the end of each month. At the end of each month. And what do you pay?

01:28.400 --> 01:34.160
You pay for everything you used. You get a bill at the end of the month. Exactly. Okay. So very

01:34.160 --> 01:39.520
interesting. These are the ways that mobile phone plans usually work. And well, now it's time for us to

01:39.520 --> 01:46.080
listen to this dialogue for the first time. We are going to be listening as a shopper is looking to

01:46.080 --> 01:49.680
buy maybe a mobile phone or get a mobile phone plan.

01:56.080 --> 02:01.200
Yeah. I just moved here and I'd like to activate my cell phone. And I'm not sure if I should go with a

02:01.200 --> 02:06.400
prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan. I see. Well, can I have a look at your phone?

02:07.440 --> 02:11.760
And fortunately, this phone can't be using the US. It's not compatible with our 3G network.

02:12.480 --> 02:18.160
What? Really? I don't really want to have to buy a new phone. Well, you're lucky. You see,

02:18.160 --> 02:23.040
if you sign up for our 3-year plan, we'll throw in a handset for free. Really? What's the cash?

02:23.040 --> 02:27.600
There's no cash. You just choose a plan, sign a 3-year contract. And that's it. Actually,

02:27.600 --> 02:31.680
we're running a special promotion right now. And we're giving away a blackberry curve with our

02:31.680 --> 02:38.960
special mega value for $40 plan. So what does this plan include? Well, you get 900 anytime minutes

02:38.960 --> 02:43.040
and you can also enjoy free mobile-to-mobile calling to other tell-mobile clients.

02:43.040 --> 02:48.480
A thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes. Oh, and we also offer

02:48.480 --> 02:54.960
a roll-over option. Wow. All this for $40 per month. That's right. Plus the activation fee and

02:54.960 --> 03:00.640
the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee and, oh, and any charges for extra minutes and.

03:00.800 --> 03:11.440
What sounds like a lot more than $40 doesn't it? This is very common. They always say that

03:11.440 --> 03:18.480
it's a very low price and they always have these hidden charges, right? Yep, you're right. So why don't

03:18.480 --> 03:22.640
we look at some of the language they were using in the dialogue now in language takeaway?

03:24.560 --> 03:29.360
Language takeaway. All right, a language takeaway today. We're going to be looking at

03:29.360 --> 03:36.320
for very basic words that are used in this whole mobile phone context and the first one is

03:36.320 --> 03:43.200
activate. To activate my cell phone. All right. So you have to activate your cell phone.

03:43.200 --> 03:49.600
That's right. You have to make the cell phone work. So basically you make it work. Now can you only

03:49.600 --> 03:55.360
apply this to mobile phones? No, there's many things that you must activate to make work. For example,

03:55.360 --> 04:01.920
you must activate your computer software. Okay, or maybe you have to activate your credit card.

04:01.920 --> 04:07.600
Or activate your bank account. So usually you do this for the first time before you start using it.

04:07.600 --> 04:12.480
Yeah, like imagine your mobile phone is sleeping, right? And you need to activate it to make it

04:12.480 --> 04:17.920
start working. But you only do it once. Right. Only once. Okay. We talk about mobile phone or we say

04:17.920 --> 04:24.480
the cell phone, but this also has a specific name, right? That's right. A hand set. Hand set.

04:25.440 --> 04:32.160
So the device, the phone, you can call it a hand set. Exactly. All right. A very easy word,

04:32.160 --> 04:38.080
but it's kind of a little bit more technical. Yeah. Now, one of the things they were talking about

04:38.080 --> 04:47.120
with this monthly rate plan was a roll-over option. Roll-over. A roll-over option.

04:47.120 --> 04:52.960
So what is this roll-over option about? Well, okay. I'll give you an example. Let's say you have

04:53.440 --> 04:58.720
500 minutes each month. And you only use four of them in this month.

04:59.760 --> 05:05.280
100 of those minutes can roll-over. It can move over to the next month. So now you have 600 minutes.

05:05.280 --> 05:10.880
So basically the minutes that you don't use, you can still use the following month. Right.

05:10.880 --> 05:17.440
Okay. So that's a roll-over plan. And we might recognize the verb to roll-over, right?

05:17.440 --> 05:22.000
Right. So it's very similar to physically move from one place to another.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.720
Yep. All right. Roll-over. And now in the end, we talked about many types of fees. That's right.

05:28.720 --> 05:37.680
Activation fee. Okay. Or we also had emergency services fee. So what is a fee? A fee is the amount

05:37.680 --> 05:43.120
of money you must pay for a service. Okay. So this is important. It's for a service.

05:43.120 --> 05:49.040
Yeah. You can't pay a fee for something you can touch. Okay. So if I go to the store, I don't say

05:49.120 --> 05:54.800
what is the fee of this bottle of water. Right. What's the fee for filling this bottle of water?

05:54.800 --> 06:00.640
Okay. So for a service. Yes, for an action. All right. Very good. So I think it's time for us to

06:00.640 --> 06:05.680
listen to this dialogue again. We're going to slow it down because it was a little bit fast.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.160
And then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

06:08.720 --> 06:21.440
Hi there. Can I help you? Yeah. I've just moved here and I'd like to activate my cell phone.

06:21.440 --> 06:28.480
And I'm not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan. I see.

06:29.280 --> 06:35.840
Well, can I have a look at your phone? Unfortunately, this phone can't be used in the US.

06:36.400 --> 06:43.760
It's not compatible with our 3G network. What? Really? I don't really want to have to buy

06:43.760 --> 06:50.080
a new phone. Well, you're in luck. You see, if you sign up for our three-year plan,

06:50.080 --> 06:58.880
we'll throw in a handset for free. Really? What's the catch? There's no catch. You just choose a plan.

06:59.440 --> 07:05.840
Sign a three-year contract. And that's it. Actually, we're running a special promotion right now.

07:05.840 --> 07:10.880
And we're giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value $40 plan.

07:11.680 --> 07:19.920
So what does this plan include? Well, you get 900 any time minutes. And you can also

07:19.920 --> 07:26.160
enjoy free mobile and mobile calling to other tell mobile clients 1000 text messages per month.

07:26.720 --> 07:32.640
And unlimited evening and weekend minutes. Oh, and we also offer a roll-over option.

07:33.200 --> 07:40.960
Wow, all this for $40 per month. That's right. Plus the activation fee, the emergency

07:40.960 --> 07:46.800
services fee, the monthly service fee, oh, and any charges for extra minutes. And

07:46.880 --> 07:55.280
well, you know, there are some interesting phrases in this dialogue. And you know, a lot of

07:55.280 --> 08:00.720
them can be used when you're talking about an negotiation or a contract or a deal. All right,

08:00.720 --> 08:08.160
great. So let's take a look at these phrases in fluency builder fluency builder. Okay, the first phrase

08:08.160 --> 08:13.920
that we have on fluency builder today was the problem that she had with her mobile phone was that

08:13.920 --> 08:21.440
it wasn't compatible with a 3G network. Okay, to be compatible with. To be compatible with.

08:21.440 --> 08:26.640
To be compatible with. Now this word compatible means that it works well with something else.

08:26.640 --> 08:32.080
Exactly. Now there's a lot of things that you can use this phrase compatible with. Together with,

08:32.960 --> 08:37.920
you know, people things. So why don't we hear a few examples now? Example one.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.280
Our application is compatible with most smart phones.

08:44.880 --> 08:51.840
Example two. My roommate and I are just not compatible. All she ever does is study.

08:51.840 --> 08:56.080
And I like to say a blatant party. Example three.

08:58.320 --> 09:02.080
I'm sorry, your computer is not compatible with our software. It's too old.

09:03.280 --> 09:10.320
Okay, great example. So compatible with very clear end. It's very useful. That's right. Now what about the

09:10.320 --> 09:15.520
next phrase? Well, you know, the the girl was hearing about all of these great things that are

09:15.520 --> 09:21.680
included in the contract. And she asked what's the catch? What's the catch? What's the catch?

09:21.680 --> 09:28.160
So she was asking for the catch. What is the catch? Well, good thing you ask. A catch is something

09:28.160 --> 09:35.120
negative. Something that's hidden that makes the deal seem not so great. Okay, so if somebody

09:35.200 --> 09:41.040
offers me a new car, that's it. You can have this new for free. Okay. Well, that seems too good to be true.

09:41.040 --> 09:48.160
So what is the catch? The catch is that I can only drive it at night. Okay. That's kind of annoying.

09:48.160 --> 09:53.520
Right. So that's the catch. There's like a condition. Yep. Now she asked about the catch.

09:53.520 --> 09:58.000
And what she said, well, there's no catch. You know, it's you just signed the contract. And then the

09:58.000 --> 10:05.840
salesman told the lady that she is in luck. You're in luck to be in luck. Well, okay. I think that

10:05.840 --> 10:10.000
I think we can really understand the meaning, right? When you're in luck, something lucky has happened.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.080
Right. You're having good fortune. But how do we use it? So maybe you're looking for a very special

10:16.080 --> 10:21.920
bottle of wine for dinner tonight. Yep. It's very rare. Okay. And you go into this little store and

10:21.920 --> 10:27.920
all of a sudden you're in luck. You found it there. Exactly. Okay. This phrase is actually most common

10:27.920 --> 10:34.720
ly used in the second person. Your in luck. You are in luck. You are in luck tonight. Yeah. And it

10:34.720 --> 10:39.520
usually when someone asks you for something, then you say you're in luck. You're in luck. I have it.

10:39.520 --> 10:45.040
Or you're in luck. I have the very last one. Exactly. All right. And now to end a fluency

10:45.040 --> 10:52.160
builder, we have one more phrase. And so it was when the salesman said, we'll throw in a handset for

10:52.880 --> 11:00.240
all right. To throw something in. So if you signs the contract, he will throw in a free handset.

11:00.240 --> 11:07.600
It means to include something for free. Okay. So you can say, if you buy this house, I'll throw in

11:07.600 --> 11:14.640
the dog, the dog for free. Right. So to throw into include for free. Right. Okay. All right.

11:14.640 --> 11:20.160
So great phrases. And I think we understand them now. So let's listen to this dialogue for the very

11:20.880 --> 11:33.520
last time. Yeah. I just moved here and I'd like to activate my cell phone. And I'm not sure

11:33.520 --> 11:39.680
if I should go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan. I see. Well, can I have a look at your phone?

11:40.720 --> 11:44.960
Unfortunately, this phone can't be using the US. It's not compatible with our 3G network.

11:45.680 --> 11:51.440
What? Really? I don't really want to have to buy a new phone. Well, you're lucky. You see,

11:51.440 --> 11:56.320
if you sign up for our 3-year plan, we'll throw in a handset for free. Really? What's the cash?

11:56.320 --> 12:00.880
There's no cash. You just choose a plan, sign a 3-year contract. And that's it. Actually,

12:00.880 --> 12:04.800
we're running a special promotion right now. And we're giving away a blackberry curve with

12:04.800 --> 12:11.680
our special mega value, $40 plan. So what does this plan include? Well, you get 900 anytime

12:11.680 --> 12:16.320
minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile-to-mobile calling to other tell-mobile clients.

12:16.320 --> 12:21.760
A thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes. Oh, and we also offer

12:21.760 --> 12:28.160
a roll-over option. Wow. All this for $40 per month. That's right. Plus, the activation fee and

12:28.160 --> 12:33.840
the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee and, oh, and any charges for extra minutes and

12:34.800 --> 12:43.120
mobile phones. This is very common in the United States, right? These monthly plans.

12:43.120 --> 12:50.720
Yeah, most places where I have lived. It's much more common to pay as you go, right, to have a prepaid plan.

12:51.280 --> 12:56.960
But in the States, almost everyone goes with the monthly plan. Maybe it's because, in order

12:56.960 --> 13:01.760
to have a monthly plan, you need to have a credit card. You might be on to something. Right?

13:01.760 --> 13:06.480
Yeah. So if you don't have a credit card or maybe you're 18, you can't get a monthly plan.

13:06.480 --> 13:11.520
So you got to do this prepaid plan. Yeah. You know, another interesting thing that I've noticed

13:11.520 --> 13:19.520
when living in different countries and seeing mobile phone habits, Americans and North Americans

13:19.520 --> 13:24.160
respond very differently to a ringing mobile phone and other people do. How so?

13:25.440 --> 13:29.600
For example, if I was in a meeting in America and my phone rang and I answered it,

13:29.600 --> 13:34.480
people might think that I was very rude to answer the phone in a meeting. But, you know,

13:34.480 --> 13:38.400
here when we're living in China, it's totally normal. It's, you know, everyone does it. That's

13:38.400 --> 13:43.840
the polite thing to do. Answer your phone. Right. And I think that's absolutely true. And maybe

13:43.840 --> 13:49.280
it's because in North America, you have this voicemail option for your mobile phone. Yeah,

13:49.280 --> 13:53.680
and everyone has it. Everyone has it. So if it's something very important, then the person will

13:53.680 --> 13:57.680
leave you a voicemail message and then you will know what it's about or you can call them back.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.520
But here, I guess, or in other countries, maybe they don't have that option. So

14:02.240 --> 14:07.040
they need to answer every call. Yeah. It's, it's interesting. An interesting sort of cultural

14:07.280 --> 14:11.840
difference in the way we use our phones. But what about listeners in your country? Do you

14:11.840 --> 14:16.960
add to the phone immediately or do you let it ring? Right. Or maybe do you see who's calling

14:16.960 --> 14:21.680
and maybe just not answering? Yeah. Screen your calls. Screen a call. So come to our website,

14:21.680 --> 14:26.960
EnglishPod.com. Let us know what your mobile phone habits are. And also, if you have any

14:27.040 --> 14:31.520
questions or doubts. Yeah. Marco and I are always there to answer your questions. So until next

14:31.520 --> 14:34.240
time, thanks for listening and goodbye. Bye.
