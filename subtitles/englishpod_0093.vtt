00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
Hello English learners, welcome back to English pod, my name is Marco.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.520
And I'm Erica.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.600
And today we're bringing you another part of our sports series, and today we're going

00:12.600 --> 00:14.600
to be talking about volleyball.

00:14.600 --> 00:19.160
That's right, and we're going all the way to New Zealand to visit the Men's Volleyball

00:19.160 --> 00:20.160
Championships.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.000
So we're going to be looking at some great words and phrases related to volleyball,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.360
and also how to describe a sporting event.

00:26.360 --> 00:32.680
So before we start on the dialogue, let's take a look at two words on vocabulary preview.

00:32.680 --> 00:33.880
The vocabulary preview.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.040
All right, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

00:37.040 --> 00:43.400
Now the first one in counter in counter and exciting in counter.

00:43.400 --> 00:49.720
All right, so if we have an exciting encounter, it means we have an exciting meeting of two

00:49.720 --> 00:52.280
people or two teams or two groups.

00:52.280 --> 00:57.400
If I say I had an incredible encounter last night with my best friend, um, you met up

00:57.400 --> 00:59.400
your best friend with your best friend and something happened.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.440
Okay, so that's what an encounter would mean.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.280
Yes, looking at our second word now, powerhouse.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.200
Two powerhouse teams.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.040
All right, so we have two powerhouse teams, China and Brazil.

01:12.040 --> 01:12.760
That's right.

01:12.760 --> 01:19.000
So a powerhouse team is basically a strong, powerful, really energetic, great team, right?

01:19.080 --> 01:24.920
Okay, so we can use it for teams such as in this case, but we can also describe maybe a company

01:24.920 --> 01:26.680
or a person at powerhouse.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.360
That guy is a powerhouse.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.360
He can lift 500 pounds.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.280
Now I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

01:34.280 --> 01:39.640
We're going to be listening to this great sporting event as we are taken to New Zealand to

01:39.880 --> 01:41.640
see China and Brazil play.

01:49.640 --> 01:53.800
It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's volleyball world championship.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.240
My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man of the plant, Bob Copeland.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.200
Thank you, Rick.

01:58.200 --> 02:03.800
We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today is two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.400
These off against each other and try to qualify for the next round.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.600
Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.800
The ref signals are started the game and here we go.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.400
We bear who serves and China quickly receives the ball.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.640
Chun bumps it to the center and very nice set by Chun.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.160
Shoes spikes it.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.680
Wow, what a great hit.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.280
The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him,

02:30.280 --> 02:33.320
but he managed to get the ball in great play.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.920
It's China service now.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.280
What a superb jump serve by Lee.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.760
Oh, oh and we have a let's serve.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.080
The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.560
Brazil calls for a timeout and we'll be right back after a short commercial break.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.040
Well sounds like a pretty exciting encounter between these two countries.

02:58.040 --> 03:02.280
Very good teams and both of them as they mentioned are powerhouse teams.

03:02.440 --> 03:07.800
Well, why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that we came across in this dialogue.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.560
We're going to be focusing on volleyball words here in language takeaway.

03:13.720 --> 03:14.920
Language takeaway.

03:16.360 --> 03:22.280
Okay, so in language takeaway today, we're going to have six words and let's start with the first one.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.600
Chen bumps it to the center.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.880
All right, two bump.

03:25.880 --> 03:30.280
All right, so in volleyball, when you are going to receive the ball,

03:30.760 --> 03:34.680
you put your arms together and you hit it with your four arms.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.200
That's right, so at the top of your arm.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.240
Right, and that's how you pass it to another player.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.760
That's called a bump.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.040
So it is a noun and a verb, a bump to bump.

03:44.040 --> 03:44.840
Exactly.

03:44.840 --> 03:51.080
Now another type of way to move the ball in volleyball we heard in the dialogue is a set.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.800
A very nice set by Chen.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.880
So a set or two set?

03:55.880 --> 03:58.360
Right, the word can be used as a verb and a noun.

03:58.360 --> 04:03.160
And again, you take the ball and you move it with the tips of your fingers.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.960
That is actually done by the setter.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.040
Right, that is done by the setter.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.160
And he does this, he sets the ball.

04:11.160 --> 04:15.160
So then the attacker can spike the ball.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.320
That's our next word, two spike.

04:17.320 --> 04:26.040
So two spike the ball or a spike is when you hit the ball very hard and very fast with the

04:26.040 --> 04:27.000
palm of your hand.

04:27.000 --> 04:27.560
That's right.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.240
And that's how you score your points, right?

04:29.240 --> 04:29.880
Exactly.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.480
So you'll see three basic moves, the bump set and spike.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.880
But what about the serve?

04:35.880 --> 04:39.960
All right, so our fourth word in volleyball is service.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.040
So it's China's service now.

04:42.040 --> 04:47.800
Right, so the service is the opportunity for the team to serve the ball.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.920
Yeah, pretty simple.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.240
Right, and that means basically to start the game by hitting it to the other side.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.240
Now when type of serve is the jump serve.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.320
Jump serve.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.920
Now this is very popular and you will see some players do this.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.920
They will throw the ball in the air and then jump in the air and hit it.

05:06.920 --> 05:07.560
That's right.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.640
All right, so that's a jump serve.

05:09.640 --> 05:13.800
And our last word for today is let serve.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.320
A let serve.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.640
Okay, we have a let serve today.

05:17.640 --> 05:24.280
So a let serve is when you serve the ball and it sort of brushes over the net.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.160
Right, it'll hit the net, but it will still pass to the other

05:27.880 --> 05:27.960
side.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.440
That's right, and that's an illegal move in volleyball isn't it?

05:30.440 --> 05:32.280
When you are serving, yes.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.520
So a let serve.

05:34.520 --> 05:40.680
Right, so those are the six terms related to volleyball that we're going to be looking at today.

05:40.680 --> 05:46.680
And well, with this in mind, let's move on to looking at some phrases now in what is it?

05:46.680 --> 05:47.480
Fluency builder.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.360
Fluency builder.

05:51.640 --> 05:56.200
All right, so our two announcers, Bob and Rick said that we've got an exciting

05:56.280 --> 05:58.360
encounter ahead of us.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.640
Right, so they use this phrase ahead of us.

06:01.640 --> 06:02.840
ahead of us.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.200
So basically, what does that mean?

06:05.400 --> 06:08.280
Something will happen in the very near future.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.720
So they are expecting it or they will encounter it, maybe.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.760
Yes, so why don't we give a few examples of this phrase.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.400
Marco, we've got a long day ahead of us.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.360
We have a very exciting trip ahead of us today.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.600
Hmm, okay, so ahead of us.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.880
So we know it's an exciting game.

06:23.880 --> 06:29.560
And we heard the announcers say without a doubt, both teams are in top shape.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.560
Okay, so the phrase without a doubt.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.760
Without a doubt.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.800
So if I start a phrase using without a doubt,

06:37.800 --> 06:40.280
you're basically saying there's no question.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.320
It's so obvious.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.680
This definitely is true.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.560
It's very true.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.360
Okay.

06:44.360 --> 06:48.680
So without a doubt, English pod is the best pod cast out there.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.960
Without a doubt, this is the strategy we should take.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.080
Okay, very good.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.320
So without a doubt, why don't we move on to our third phrase now?

06:57.320 --> 07:00.840
This will prove to be a competitive match.

07:00.840 --> 07:05.640
So let's look at the phrase, will prove to be something will prove to be.

07:05.640 --> 07:09.640
Okay, so before we get into it, why don't we listen to some examples?

07:11.160 --> 07:12.120
Example one.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.320
And I think you'll prove to be the greatest president we've ever had.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.000
Example two.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.440
The new HR policy is proving to be a waste of time.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.320
Example three.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.760
We were worried that we were going to get laid off,

07:36.760 --> 07:38.520
but our fear is proved to be untrue.

07:42.280 --> 07:47.400
Okay, so when something will prove to be, it will show itself to be this thing, right?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.600
It will demonstrate.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.800
We will see it.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.880
We will see for sure how it will be.

07:51.880 --> 07:57.720
And now for our fourth phrase, very simple one, but very common in sports commentators,

07:57.720 --> 07:58.840
or when you're watching a game.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.560
You'll say, great play.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.440
Great play.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.120
Great play.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.480
A great play.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.800
Now we know play is usually a verb, right?

08:08.440 --> 08:10.120
But here it's acting as a noun.

08:10.120 --> 08:14.520
A play is basically a move in a sport or a game.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.840
So when somebody says a great play,

08:16.920 --> 08:21.880
it means all the succession of moves and passes and hits to make the point.

08:21.880 --> 08:22.520
Yep.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.040
So it was a great play.

08:24.040 --> 08:24.520
Mm-hmm.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.240
And that you can use that for any sport, right?

08:27.800 --> 08:31.640
So why don't we listen to our dialogue now for the second time?

08:31.640 --> 08:36.120
And then we'll come back and talk about this very popular sport volleyball.

08:36.120 --> 08:48.200
It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's volleyball world championship.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.560
My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the Man of the Planet, Bob Copeland.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.520
Thank you, Rick.

08:52.520 --> 08:56.680
We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today is two powerhouse teams,

08:56.680 --> 08:58.120
Brazil and China.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.720
These off against each other and try to qualify for the next round.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.600
Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.000
And this will prove to be a competitive match.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.120
The ref signals a start of the game and here we go.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.200
We bear who serves and China quickly receives the ball.

09:14.200 --> 09:18.040
Chun bumps it to the center and very nice set by Chun.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.560
Shoes spikes it.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.160
Wow, what a great hit.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.680
The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him,

09:24.680 --> 09:27.720
but he managed to get the ball in great play.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.320
It's China service now.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.680
What a superb jump serve by Lee.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.240
Oh, and we have a let's serve.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.040
The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.960
Brazil calls for a timeout and we'll be right back after a short commercial break.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.440
So you were volleyball fan Marco?

09:50.440 --> 09:51.640
It's a very nice sport.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.720
It's very fast and it's very hard.

09:53.720 --> 09:54.760
Yep.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.320
But it's very interesting to get together with friends.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.440
Maybe at the beach and play some beach volleyball or something like that.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.600
Yeah, I think that's the best place to play volleyball.

10:02.600 --> 10:06.600
You know, we even have beach volleyball up in a freezing cold Canada.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.400
And do you have sand?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.080
Um, occasionally.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.600
All right.

10:10.600 --> 10:16.040
So volleyball is a great sport, but now we want to know what sport you want to learn about.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.880
We've covered soccer, we've covered basketball, we've covered volleyball.

10:19.880 --> 10:25.080
So tell us what other sports you would like to learn vocabulary and phrases on.

10:25.240 --> 10:31.480
That's right. You can tell us this and many more things at EnglishPod.com our website.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.440
So check it out.

10:32.440 --> 10:36.360
Right. Leave your questions in comments and we'll see you guys there.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.040
Thanks for downloading and until next time.

10:38.040 --> 10:38.680
Bye.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.680
Bye.
