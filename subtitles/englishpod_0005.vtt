00:00.000 --> 00:06.920
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.080
I'm Amira.

00:08.080 --> 00:15.920
All right. Amira is here today and she is going to tell us about the wonderful lesson she has prepared this time.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.160
Well, thank you, Marco.

00:17.160 --> 00:24.920
Well, today we have a very interesting lesson prepared for you. It's about someone cutting in line.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.600
Cutting in line? Okay.

00:26.600 --> 00:32.880
Yeah, it happens all the time and we all get very upset about it, but you know, it happens.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.240
Right, right.

00:34.240 --> 00:38.600
Well, I imagine that everyone is wondering what cutting in line is.

00:38.600 --> 00:42.840
Why don't we just listen to the dialogue one time?

00:42.840 --> 00:48.720
And then when we come back, Amira and I will gladly explain all the vocabulary in this dialogue.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.880
Let's listen.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.880
I can't believe it took us two hours to get here.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.160
The traffic in New York is unbelievable.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.720
Yeah, but just relax, honey. We're here and we're going on vacation.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.200
In a few hours, we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

01:10.200 --> 01:16.200
Oh, no. Look at that line. It must be a mile long. There's no way I'm waiting for another two hours.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.600
Honey, don't.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.840
Hey, man, the end of the line is over there.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.920
Yeah.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.840
No, seriously, I was your first and you can't cut in line like this.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.480
Says who? I do. So sue me. All right, that's it.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.080
Whoa, I think there's punching.

01:40.080 --> 01:46.600
Yeah. Yeah, I guess this guy was just a crazy, I don't know, impatient man, huh?

01:46.600 --> 01:50.200
Yes, yes, but we don't want to talk about this now.

01:50.200 --> 01:57.120
But for now, we will treat some of the vocabulary and very useful phrases in the dialogue.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.960
Great. Mark, would you want to start?

01:58.960 --> 02:02.120
Yes. Let's take a look at our first word.

02:02.120 --> 02:08.920
It would be unbelievable, unbelievable, unbelievable, unbelievable.

02:08.920 --> 02:14.280
Exactly. And just how you say it, it's something incredible, something amazing.

02:14.280 --> 02:21.800
Yeah, but I would like to point out that unbelievable was used here to describe the man's frustration.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.600
He's not happy about the traffic in New York.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.440
Exactly. Perfect.

02:26.440 --> 02:32.680
Okay. In the next part, the woman she's trying to calm and relax her husband.

02:32.680 --> 02:37.640
And she says that they'll be in Hawaii in a few hours.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.680
And you'll be on the golf course.

02:40.760 --> 02:46.600
Right. So we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.760
Yes, we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

02:50.760 --> 02:57.080
So this is a great way of talking about your physical location in the future.

02:57.080 --> 03:01.320
Right. So for example, Amira, tomorrow, where will you be?

03:01.320 --> 03:04.760
Don't worry, Marco. I'll be in the office tomorrow.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.640
Perfect, right? That's where I need you to be.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.920
Yes. Okay.

03:08.920 --> 03:12.600
All right. Well, I have another interesting phrase here for you.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.520
Must be a mile long. A mile long.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.680
A mile long. A mile long.

03:20.680 --> 03:26.760
Now, that's basically not a mile. It's not a kilometer long.

03:27.320 --> 03:33.400
But it's another way of saying that this line is really, really long.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.080
Right. It's just an exaggeration.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.280
Now let's take a look at there's no way.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.760
There's no way.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.360
There's no way.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.480
There's no way.

03:44.200 --> 03:51.720
Perfect. Let's listen to some other examples on how we use there's no way in a different situation.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.520
And then we can come back and talk about it a little bit more.

03:54.680 --> 04:05.160
There's no way I can have those reports finished today.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.520
The stadium is so crowded that there's no way we'll find a seat.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.120
Do you think Michael's going to buy that house?

04:29.080 --> 04:31.320
There's no way he has enough money to buy it.

04:37.960 --> 04:43.240
All right, everyone. So there's no way is another way of saying it is impossible.

04:43.800 --> 04:48.360
Exactly. There's no way you should miss this podcast, right?

04:48.360 --> 04:52.680
Yes. Well, I have another phrase for you as well.

04:53.400 --> 05:00.600
Cut in line. Cut in line. Cut in line. Cut in line. Cut in line.

05:01.400 --> 05:07.240
So again, we have some really good examples on how you could use this phrase in different situations.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.480
Let's listen to the examples and then we can come back and talk about it some more.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.560
Excuse me. I'm really late. Can I cut in line, please?

05:29.160 --> 05:35.320
I hate it when people cut in line at the bank. It's so rude. I think it's okay when a pregnant woman cuts in line.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.920
All right, everyone. Cut in line.

05:43.800 --> 05:51.480
Right. So from the examples, we can understand that it means when you are standing in line somewhere

05:51.480 --> 05:53.320
and somebody gets in front of you.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.760
Right. I have another phrase for you here.

05:56.760 --> 06:09.880
Sue me. Sue me. Sue me. Okay. Now, Sue me is not a nice phrase. If you hear that, you know you're in trouble.

06:09.880 --> 06:13.720
Yeah, it's kind of rude, I guess, to say sue me.

06:13.720 --> 06:23.640
Right. Well, it actually means like taking someone to court and asking for money because someone has harmed you in a way.

06:23.640 --> 06:33.640
I think that we should listen to the dialogue one more time and try to figure out why he used that phrase

06:33.640 --> 06:36.520
and if he's really going to take him to court.

06:39.880 --> 06:49.720
I can't believe it took us two hours to get here. The traffic in New York is unbelievable.

06:49.720 --> 06:53.240
Yeah, but just relax, honey. We're here. We're going on vacation.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.360
In a few hours, we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

06:56.360 --> 07:02.760
Oh, no. Look at that line. It must be a mile long. There's no way I'm waiting for another two hours.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.760
Honey, don't.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.640
Hey, man, the end of the line is over there. Yeah.

07:10.440 --> 07:13.400
No, seriously, I was your first and you can't cut in line like this.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.840
Says who? I do. So sue me. All right, that's it.

07:22.280 --> 07:27.800
All right, we're back. Now, this guy, when he says sue me, he's just being rude.

07:27.800 --> 07:34.600
I mean, he's just being a kind of impolite impolite and telling him, I don't care.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.880
Right. Exactly. Like you can't do anything about it.

07:38.600 --> 07:46.040
Yeah, yeah. Okay, today in the studio, we have a guest. Her name is Sarah and she's from England.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.880
Hi, that. Hello.

07:49.080 --> 07:55.640
All right. So we're going to be asking her a couple of questions and she'll be a frequent

07:55.640 --> 07:59.320
guest on our show. So you can expect to hear from her a lot.

07:59.320 --> 08:03.080
Well, she didn't know that. It's, yes, it's a surprise. She knows now.

08:04.440 --> 08:10.120
Well, Sarah, our topic today is about jumping the cue.

08:11.160 --> 08:14.040
Okay, Amira, wait, what is this? Jump the cue.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.120
It's the same as kind of line, but in British English.

08:18.680 --> 08:24.920
Oh, okay. Yes, queuing. It's very important in England. We're very proud of our cues.

08:26.040 --> 08:32.600
That's true. That's true. So what would be the reaction of people if they like, you know, cut in line?

08:33.640 --> 08:39.960
I think we do take it very seriously. I'm laughing now, but it's quite serious. So you don't

08:39.960 --> 08:46.920
dump the cue. If people jump in front of you, it's you get a little tuts and so you shouldn't

08:46.920 --> 08:51.800
be doing that. And we make it very obvious. So you say it out loud.

08:51.800 --> 08:57.800
Well, we would, you know, perhaps say something. And we have systems, you know, in London,

08:57.800 --> 09:03.480
on the bay, on the metro, on the underground. You have to stand on the escalators on the right

09:03.480 --> 09:08.840
and cue, and you can't jump in front. You have to walk on the left and cue on the right.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.640
It's all very serious. There's rules and regulations.

09:12.440 --> 09:18.520
Is there like a cue handbook that you have to read in high school and kind of take a test on?

09:18.600 --> 09:23.240
Perhaps that should be. That should be, yeah. Wow. What about New York, Marco?

09:23.240 --> 09:31.160
Well, no, definitely, I guess this dialogue is similar to a reality of New York. If somebody

09:31.160 --> 09:38.040
gets in front of you or cuts the line, somebody's going to say something and probably end up in a fight

09:38.040 --> 09:46.120
if the guy is rude. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. Well, Sarah, why don't you tell us, is there a line or a cue

09:46.120 --> 09:54.600
for almost everything in England? It seems like we do just like to form a cue. Yeah. So, you know,

09:54.600 --> 09:59.160
can you think of like some other examples of where you would normally you wouldn't cue, but you do?

09:59.960 --> 10:05.880
Oh, gosh. Things like in the supermarket when you're trying to find some vegetables or something,

10:05.880 --> 10:10.600
I'd never push, I'd never reach round or anything. I'd just wait until that person had finished

10:10.600 --> 10:18.120
picking up their star and then go in. So, just try and... So, if like five people want to buy oranges

10:18.120 --> 10:23.320
at the supermarket, then you have a little mini cue of five people waiting. There's no, there's no

10:23.320 --> 10:28.360
sort of just shoving through it to the front. You just don't do that. So, you don't stick your hand

10:28.360 --> 10:33.320
out and grab like a tomato. Well, if you do again, you would make sure that that person knows, oh,

10:33.320 --> 10:41.000
I'm sorry, I'm just in a hurry or whatever. But yeah, just letting someone go before you is a

10:41.000 --> 10:46.600
courtesy, I think. Okay. That's quite important to us. All right. Great. Well, thank you so much, Sarah.

10:46.600 --> 10:51.960
It's a pleasure. Yeah, we'll have you back very soon. So, all right, we're out of time, but we'll

10:51.960 --> 10:58.040
be back tomorrow with another lesson and be sure to visit our website. Don't forget that Englishbot.com

10:58.040 --> 11:05.960
has many, many resources and also a community of users and teachers that can help you answer

11:05.960 --> 11:13.160
questions and interact with you. Yes, and you should definitely leave your suggestions. But for now,

11:13.160 --> 11:16.440
I wish you all well and bye.
