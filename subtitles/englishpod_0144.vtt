00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
Hello English learners. Welcome back to English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:06.360 --> 00:09.920
And my name is Katherine and today we're talking about something very serious.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.360
Very serious. Today we're talking about capital punishment.

00:13.360 --> 00:17.920
So if you've never heard that phrase before, you might have heard another name for this topic.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.920
It's called the death penalty.

00:19.920 --> 00:26.800
Right. So if you commit a crime and basically the judge says that you will have to be put to death for that crime.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.640
All right. So many countries no longer have this. This law, the United States.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.360
You can see it in some places, some states, but not in others.

00:33.360 --> 00:39.120
So we're talking about today is the debate between to have the death penalty and to not have it.

00:39.120 --> 00:46.080
All right. So we're going to actually have a little debate in the end of if we agree that we should have the death penalty or not.

00:46.080 --> 00:50.000
But before that, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

00:56.800 --> 01:02.480
That's all for today's class. We'll continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.000
Do you think we should be tougher on crime?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.080
Well, it depends on what you mean.

01:12.080 --> 01:17.440
For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences for lesser

01:17.440 --> 01:20.960
offenses, and lock up juvenile offenders.

01:20.960 --> 01:26.560
Those sound like really draconian measures. Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice?

01:26.560 --> 01:29.120
If you've already put innocent people to death?

01:29.120 --> 01:34.160
You'd only use capital punishment if you're absolutely sure that you'd convicted the right person.

01:34.160 --> 01:38.720
But there've been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years.

01:38.720 --> 01:43.440
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.880
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.

01:46.880 --> 01:54.560
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.960
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent all the detectionary is so low.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.280
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they're going to be caught.

02:03.280 --> 02:07.440
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

02:07.440 --> 02:11.520
But if you detect more crime, you still need prisons. In my reckoning,

02:11.520 --> 02:15.520
if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they can't get away with it.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.320
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.680
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.

02:23.680 --> 02:27.760
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.520
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.280
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.200
You sound like a dick tier.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.800
Well, if it works, why not?

02:44.640 --> 02:49.520
Alright, so Markle, there's a lot of really great legal terms here, legal and crime terms,

02:49.520 --> 02:53.520
and so let's look at a few of these in today's language takeaway.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.920
Language takeaway.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.440
Alright, so let's take a look at the first one.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.800
They mentioned juvenile fenders.

03:02.800 --> 03:07.520
Alright, so let's look at these two words, because, um, well, a fender can be pretty general.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.440
It's someone who commits a crime.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.440
So an offender.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.440
But we're talking about a special kind of offender.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.600
Here we're talking about juvenile offenders.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.040
So they're young offenders.

03:17.040 --> 03:22.080
Right, and in America, legally, you're a juvenile offender if you're under the age of 18.

03:22.240 --> 03:26.960
Okay, so if you commit a crime while you are a juvenile, you get judged differently.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.720
Right, you don't get the same treatment as an adult.

03:28.720 --> 03:34.480
Right, the usually the punishments are not as harsh, because people like to think that younger people,

03:34.480 --> 03:38.080
younger children or teenagers, they don't really understand the law.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.880
They don't really understand crime or good and bad.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.960
So it should be easier on them.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.000
Hmm.

03:44.000 --> 03:44.800
Alright, very good.

03:44.800 --> 03:50.640
So we have juvenile offenders, and we also have a wrongful conviction.

03:50.720 --> 03:55.600
Alright, this is an, oh, moment for a, for a judge, because a wrongful conviction,

03:55.600 --> 03:57.440
well, conviction first of all is a decision.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.840
So this is a court's decision on whether or not a person is guilty.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.520
So you convicted the person.

04:03.520 --> 04:08.720
Right, Marco was convicted guilty of stealing my computer.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.800
I was too, that happened.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.320
Okay, right.

04:12.320 --> 04:17.440
But it's a wrongful conviction if Marco didn't really still a computer.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.560
But we decided that he did.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.320
Okay, so it was, it was a wrong decision.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.640
Right, it was a bad decision in the sense that it's actually not what happened in reality.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.840
A wrongful conviction, very good.

04:29.840 --> 04:37.120
And actually related to a wrongful conviction, many times it happens, because evidence is fabricated by the police.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.560
Alright, so this is a big no-no.

04:38.560 --> 04:43.600
This is something that really shouldn't happen, and it's against the law in many countries.

04:43.600 --> 04:48.400
So fabrication, or to fabricate, is to fake, to make something up.

04:49.440 --> 04:54.800
And so evidence that's fabricated is, is evidence that the police or other people create

04:54.800 --> 04:58.000
to try and make someone look guilty, but it's not actually evidence.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It's not really, it's not true.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.200
It's not true, right.

05:01.200 --> 05:06.640
And now moving on, they were talking about a deterrent for crime.

05:06.640 --> 05:12.480
Okay, so to deter is a verb, to deter means to try and get someone to not do something.

05:12.480 --> 05:18.720
Alright, so I'm going to try and deter my staff from taking early lunch breaks.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.600
So I'm going to punish someone as a deterrent.

05:21.600 --> 05:27.200
As a deterrent, okay, so you have the verb deter, and you have the noun a deterrent.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.400
Right.

05:28.400 --> 05:33.360
Yeah, and so oftentimes, very strict laws are meant to be deterrence.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.280
They're meant to keep people from doing bad things, from breaking the law.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.120
Alright, so for example, capital punishment is one of those deterrence.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.800
If you kill somebody, then if you get caught, you are also going to be killed.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.160
So I mean, I'm never going to kill anyone because I don't want the law to decide that I'm going

05:48.160 --> 05:49.600
to get killed exactly.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.760
And our last word for today, they were talking about imposing tougher laws.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.760
I would impose tougher laws.

05:55.760 --> 06:01.760
Okay, so to impose is a verb that means to put in place or to set up or enact.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.920
And so, but by force, right, you don't really, you don't really agree to do it.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.960
Like, the dictator imposes his will.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.840
Alright, so he makes everyone do what he wants.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.880
But we can impose measures that do something.

06:14.880 --> 06:21.760
It's, yeah, it's kind of like, forcibly making people follow some kind of rule or follow a person.

06:21.760 --> 06:26.080
Now, sometimes you would see that you have a company or you have people at your house.

06:26.080 --> 06:31.040
And they're like, well, you know, stay over for dinner and they're like, oh, I wouldn't want to impose.

06:31.040 --> 06:35.200
Alright, so I wouldn't want to bother you or I wouldn't want to create more work for you.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.920
Because, you know, when you're making food, you have all these people.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.760
They don't want to impose on you.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.520
Alright, so that's another way of using this impose on somebody.

06:43.520 --> 06:47.360
Alright, so after all of these words that we've taken a look at,

06:47.360 --> 06:49.440
why don't we start now with Fluency Builder?

06:50.560 --> 06:52.000
Fluency Builder.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Okay, so as you know, Fluency Builder is a place where you get to talk about some phrases and words

06:56.000 --> 06:58.800
that allow you to be more fluent in English.

06:58.800 --> 07:03.520
So these are sometimes idioms or sometimes phrases words that go together commonly.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.880
And the first one is no exception.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.800
It's a miscarriage, so miscarriage of justice.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.880
Alright, a miscarriage of justice.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.880
Now, we have different words here.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.240
The first one miscarriage is usually related to a medical term.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.920
Right, it's a pregnancy that has a sad result.

07:19.920 --> 07:24.080
It's a pregnancy where the woman's baby dies or the woman loses the baby.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.000
And a miscarriage of justice is a metaphor.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.680
It's a way to say that justice was not carried out.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.840
It means that, for example, with those wrongful convictions,

07:36.960 --> 07:40.560
the law failed to accomplish its objective.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.040
Yeah, to accomplish its objective and to be fair.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.480
Okay, so a miscarriage of justice, interesting.

07:46.480 --> 07:53.280
And moving on to our next phrase, they were talking and discussing this whole death penalty situation

07:53.280 --> 07:56.480
and she mentioned in my reckoning.

07:56.480 --> 08:01.520
Alright, so this is a great way to share your opinion or your idea with someone.

08:01.840 --> 08:08.240
You're saying pretty much, in my opinion, in my, according to me or, you know,

08:08.240 --> 08:10.000
the way I'm thinking is this.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.320
So I can also say, I reckon, right?

08:12.320 --> 08:15.520
Exactly, I reckon it's going to rain later.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.960
I think it's going to rain.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.200
So in my reckoning, in my opinion.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.800
Alright, I reckon.

08:21.920 --> 08:26.400
And to finish off fluency builder, they said that the person or the criminal

08:26.400 --> 08:28.800
couldn't get away with it.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.640
Alright, so this is another one of those phrases that each word maybe means something different.

08:32.640 --> 08:40.000
You can get somewhere, but put together to get away with something means to do something bad

08:40.000 --> 08:46.560
or illegal or that's not okay without getting caught or being punished or being punished.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.800
So you can say, get away with murder.

08:48.800 --> 08:54.080
You know, he got away with murder, you know, he did something that was really, really bad,

08:54.080 --> 08:55.520
but no one caught him.

08:55.520 --> 08:59.360
And also, it means the criminal got away, so they couldn't catch him.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.680
Right, or I could always say to my brother,

09:01.680 --> 09:04.720
he would always lie to my parents and get away with it.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.200
So he never got caught, he never got punished.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.680
Okay, so he got away with his lie or got away with it.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.720
Got his way.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.280
Alright, so I think this is an interesting phrase.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.520
Why don't we listen to a couple of more examples?

09:16.560 --> 09:17.520
Example one.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.000
Do you think they could get away with using the cheaper product?

09:24.240 --> 09:25.040
Example two.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.720
Thieves got away with two Picasso's, which were never found.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.440
Example three.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.280
He almost got away with murder.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.920
Unfortunately for him, the police discovered his secret.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.320
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.680
Why don't we listen to where dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.920
That's all for today's class.

09:57.920 --> 10:01.360
We'll continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.480
Do you think we should be tougher on crime?

10:09.280 --> 10:10.800
Well, it depends on what you mean.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.720
For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder.

10:14.720 --> 10:19.520
Give longer prison sentences for lesser offenses and lock up juvenile offenders.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.800
Who sound like really draconian measures?

10:22.880 --> 10:27.760
Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent people to death?

10:28.480 --> 10:33.440
You don't use capital punishment if you're absolutely sure that you've convicted the right person.

10:33.440 --> 10:38.080
But there've been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years.

10:38.080 --> 10:42.720
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.760
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.

10:46.320 --> 10:51.920
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer prison sentences

10:52.000 --> 10:53.440
to deter serious crime.

10:54.080 --> 10:58.320
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent all the detection rate is so low.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.640
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who committed that they're going to be caught.

11:02.640 --> 11:06.320
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.520
But if you detect more crime, you still need prisons.

11:09.520 --> 11:14.880
In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they can't get away with it.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.760
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.

11:18.400 --> 11:22.960
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.

11:22.960 --> 11:26.960
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.880
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.

11:30.880 --> 11:36.640
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.480
You sound like a dictator.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.080
Well, if it works, why not?

11:40.160 --> 11:50.880
All right, so now the big question, Katherine, do you agree with the death penalty?

11:51.600 --> 11:55.920
Oh, this is a big one, and I don't think we have enough time to go into it in much detail here,

11:55.920 --> 11:59.120
but I definitely think that is extreme, right?

11:59.120 --> 12:01.760
And so we have this phrase, a draconian measure.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.440
Right, they mentioned that in the dialogue.

12:03.440 --> 12:08.080
Yeah, so draconian, something as draconian, is excessive or severe, you know?

12:08.640 --> 12:14.160
And I think that there are a lot of reasons not to have the death penalty, because the death penalty,

12:14.160 --> 12:18.160
well, you're pretty much saying, we as a society think that murder is wrong,

12:18.160 --> 12:22.640
but we're going to show you that you've done a wrong thing, like a bad thing, that's against the law,

12:22.640 --> 12:24.640
by killing you, all right?

12:24.640 --> 12:30.640
And so I have to disagree with that on a philosophical level, but what about practical?

12:30.640 --> 12:34.720
Practically speaking, I think that there are a lot of problems with the prison system and the legal

12:35.280 --> 12:38.080
in the United States, for example, because prisons are really crowded.

12:38.080 --> 12:42.960
One percent of the American population is imprisoned, and so I think that so long as the prison system

12:42.960 --> 12:46.720
still has problems, there's a really good argument for having the death penalty, but still,

12:46.720 --> 12:51.680
I think that it's excessive, and it's unnecessary, and that there are other ways to treat

12:51.680 --> 12:52.800
and punish prisoners.

12:52.800 --> 12:58.720
It is an interesting topic, because you have many different angles that are in favor or against

12:58.720 --> 13:02.560
the death penalty, for example, you have religious views where you say that you should not take

13:02.640 --> 13:06.800
a life of another person no matter what, or you have other views that say that the death penalty

13:06.800 --> 13:11.040
is simply wrong, and that you can't write a wrong with another wrong.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.080
Right, exactly.

13:12.080 --> 13:17.520
So it kind of doesn't make sense, but at the same time, you do, like you say, the prisons are

13:17.520 --> 13:23.440
full of people, and it costs around, I think it's $12,000 a year per person to keep them in prison.

13:23.440 --> 13:27.360
So what do you do with all of these people that have life sentences that are going to spend

13:27.360 --> 13:29.120
the rest of their lives in jail?

13:29.200 --> 13:36.080
So it is interesting, and many countries are very, very strict with their legal system in comparison

13:36.080 --> 13:37.680
with the United States, right?

13:37.680 --> 13:41.920
Definitely, but there is a statistic that's pretty stunning that I think among the top 20

13:41.920 --> 13:45.520
developed nations in the world, I think only the United States is the one with the death penalty.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.320
Exactly.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.680
And actually, the ratio of the people compared to the population that are in jail is much higher

13:51.680 --> 13:53.440
in the United States than in other countries.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.160
That's true.

13:54.160 --> 13:59.120
So it is a very questionable topic, but we want to know what you think.

13:59.120 --> 14:05.520
Do you think that the death penalty is a justifiable way to do justice?

14:05.520 --> 14:08.560
Or do you think maybe it's just wrong, and we shouldn't have it anymore?

14:08.560 --> 14:12.880
Yeah, we're hoping that this will get the conversation going on our website.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.120
If you have any opinions, please let us know about them.

14:15.120 --> 14:20.400
Englishpod.com is the website, and of course, you can always email us or send us a PM

14:20.400 --> 14:21.520
if you're a little bit shy.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.120
All right, so we'll see you guys there.

14:23.120 --> 14:23.760
Bye, everyone.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.800
Bye.
