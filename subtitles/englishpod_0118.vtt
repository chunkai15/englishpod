Hello English learners. Welcome back to another podcast here at English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
And I'm Erica. And today we have a fun dialogue.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
That's right. Well, maybe the language in this lesson you won't use every day, but it's it's fun. It's interesting.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
And it's a little bit on the lighter side.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
That's right. Today we're going to be looking at baby talk. So we're going to see some of these words that aren't really words.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
They're not real words that you can find in the dictionary, but native English speakers use them when they're talking to little babies.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah. In many languages, there's there's a rule for how you make baby talk words, right?

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Right. But in English, we don't have really clear rules about how you make a word a baby word.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
So we're going to teach you a few of these baby words.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
Exactly. So before we listen to the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview?

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
Okay. We have two words here. We're going to hear in the dialogue. And the first one is diaper.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
diaper.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Okay. So a diaper. A baby uses a diaper.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
That's right. It's a piece of cloth or material that you put around the baby so that it can go to the bathroom and not make a mess.

01:21.000 --> 01:31.000
Okay. A diaper. Now we also have another word that we commonly use in the English language. It's Nana. Nana.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
So Nana is the name we call a grandmother.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Right. So in informal name, just like in Spanish, we would say something like abuelita.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
Or in Italian, you might say, oh, ma. This is another way that we can call a grandma or granny.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Okay. So Nana. Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time?

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Let's see how these new parents are talking to their little baby using baby talk.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Honey, the baby's up again.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
It's your turn. I went last night.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Fine.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
Hello, little baby. Why are you crying with a baby?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I see. You made a do-do-do.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
What's going on, honey? Why is the baby crying?

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
A little baby made a do-do-do.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
What a good boy. Let's get this Ikki diaper off you.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Lucky what I have there. Mickey Mouse jammies.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Did the little baby just tinkle all over daddy?

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Yes he did. Yes he did. You just made a wee wee all over daddy.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
What's still while I change his Yaki diaper?

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
What's going on in here?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Oh look, it's Nana. Say hi to Nana.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
Oh, he's so adorable. I could just eat him off.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Okay, say bye to Nana. Time to go baby, bye.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Okay, well that was pretty cute, wasn't it?

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
A cute dialogue. The baby seemed to be cute and well everyone's excited about the new baby.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
But they use some really interesting little words that are pretty unfamiliar.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
So let's look at them now in language takeaway.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
All right, so as we mentioned before, these words aren't actually words. They you won't find them in the dictionary.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
Right, but you'll hear them commonly when people are talking to babies and you might see them in a movie or something like that.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
So why don't we get started with the first one?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
All right, the first word that may seem a little bit strange.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
The father said hello, little baby.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
Okay, whittle. So whittle is just a baby talkway of saying little little.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
That's right. Now the father saw that the baby was crying because he made a doo-doo.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
The baby made the doo-doo, not the father.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Right, the baby made a doo-doo.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Okay, so basically a doo-doo is when the baby poos or poops in the diaper.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Okay, so, you know, sometimes you go to the bathroom and it might take a little bit longer.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Exactly.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
That's because of the doo-doo.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
The doo-doo.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
Right, the actual technical or maybe the proper English word for this would be defecate.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Okay, so make a doo-doo.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
All right, now our third words are interesting because he said Iki diaper.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
That's right, an Iki diaper.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And then he also said Iki.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
So we've got two words here that mean the same thing. Iki and Iki.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
And basically means disgusting.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Right, something that's really, really not nice.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So you would say Iki or Iki.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Now these words have other similar words.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
We might recognize Iki or Iki.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Right, so you would use Iki or Iki if something is disgusting.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
But when you're kind of talking to a baby, you would say Iki.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Yep, the adjective.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
Now our next word, the the father said he has some Mickey Mouse jammies.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Jammies.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Jammies.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Okay, so what are jammies?

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, the word jammies is short for pajamas.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Okay, pajamas.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
So the clothes that you put on when you go to sleep.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Jammies.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Jammies.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
All right.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
And now for our last two words, they mean the same thing as well.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
The little baby tingled all over daddy.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
So two tingles.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
And then his mom said a wee wee all over daddy.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
You made a wee wee.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Okay, so tingle and wee wee.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Basically also going to the bathroom, but this time to pee.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
To pee exactly, to urinate wee wee.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
So the verb two tingle and the noun a wee wee.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Very good.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
So these are the words that we have for you today in language.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Take away as you can see they're kind of cute and very common when you're talking to babies.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
And you know, you have to be a little bit nicer.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Mm-hmm.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
All right.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue another time, a little bit slower.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And you'll catch these words a little bit easier.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Honey, the babies up again.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
It's your turn.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I wouldn't last night.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Fine.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Hello, little baby.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Why are you crying with a baby?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Oh, I see.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You made a do-do.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
What's going on, hun?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Why is the baby crying?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
The little baby made a do-do.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
What a good boy.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Let's get this Ikki diaper off you.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Lucky what I have here.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Mickey Mouse jammies.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Whoopsie daisy.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Did the little baby just tingle all over daddy?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yes he did.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yes he did.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
He did.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
He just made a wheelie all over daddy.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
What's still while I change his Yaki diaper?

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh, what's going on in here?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Oh look, it's Nana.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Say hi to Nana.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh, he's so adorable.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
I could just eat him off.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Okay, say bye to Nana.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Time to go, baby, bye.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
Alright, so now that we've seen those great words, let's take a look at two phrases that

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
we're going to look at now in Fluency Builder.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Fluency Builder.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
So the mother didn't really want to get up and look after the baby.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
She said, it's your turn.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
It's your turn.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
It's your turn.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
So when she says, it's your turn.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
That means you should do it now.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Right, so she's basically saying, now you have to do it.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
I did it last time.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
So now you have to do it.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Mm-hmm.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
It's your turn.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
That's right.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
It's your turn.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And well, the Nana, the grandmother.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
She was really, of course she really loves this little baby.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And she said, I could just eat him up.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I could just eat him up.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I could just eat him up.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Now does she want to really eat him?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
No, of course.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Of course not.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
So what does she mean by this?

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
This is a phrase we often use with very cute things.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
It just means, oh my god, he's so cute.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Okay, he's so cute that I wish I could just hug him and kiss him a lot.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Yes, we might use this with babies or maybe with puppies.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I could just eat him up.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
All right.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
So great two phrases that we've just taken a look at.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Let's go back to our dialogue for the last time.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about these babies.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Honey, the babies have again.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
It's your turn.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I wouldn't last night.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Fine.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Hello, little baby.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Why are you crying, little baby?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
I see.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
You made a do-do-do-do.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
What's going on, hun?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Why is the baby crying?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Why are you crying, little baby?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
I see.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
You made a do-do-do-do.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
What's going on, hun?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Why is the baby crying?

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
A little baby made a do-do-do.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
What a good boy.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Let's get this Ikki diaper off you.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Lucky what I have here.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Mickey Mouse jammies.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Who's it easy?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Did the little baby just tinkle all over daddy?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Yes, he did.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Yes, he did.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
You just made a wily all over daddy.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Hold still while I change his Yaki diaper.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
What's going on in here?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Oh look, it's Nana.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Say hi to Nana.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Oh, he's so adorable.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I could just eat him off.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Okay, say bye to Nana.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Time to go, baby, bye.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Okay, so they are obviously new parents.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
They've just had a baby so they're excited about him waking up.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
They're all excited about the baby and how he wakes up and everything.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
But an interesting thing, the baby was sleeping in another room.

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
In English speaking countries, people have sort of two different opinions about how you should sleep with your baby.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
You know, some people want to have the baby in the bed with them, right?

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
But some people think, no, the baby should definitely sleep in its own room.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Okay, in another room and in a crib.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:15.000
Right, I think this is a very important issue because many people consider that it's a good thing for the baby to sleep with the parents and if you're safe,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
and you can make sure the baby's okay.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
And it's easier for, you know, waking up to feed the baby and change a diaper.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Exactly.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
And well, if the baby is sleeping with its parents, it might not wake up as much.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
But other people think, if you let the baby sleep with the parents,

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
the baby will become kind of spoiled and not a very good baby.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Right, it might become too dependent on the parents.

11:39.000 --> 11:46.000
And for example, if you ever want to go out or leave the baby with a babysitter or when the baby starts maybe preschool or kindergarten,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
it might not be really independent.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
So why don't you tell us what you think?

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
Do you think it's a good idea to allow a baby to sleep with you or should sleep in its own room?

11:57.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah, you can tell us at our website EnglishPod.com, where you can also ask any questions you have about the language in this dialogue.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
All right, guys, so we'll see you there and until next time.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Bye.
