00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Welcome back, English learners. My name is Marco, and I am joined by...

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Erica.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
How are you, Erica?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
I'm doing great, Marco and you?

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Excellent. I'm doing really well, and I'm really excited about our lesson for today.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
That's right. We've got an intermediate lesson today, and we're gonna study some real English.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
English that you use every day, right?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
That's right. English that native speakers really use.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Exactly, and today, as Erica mentioned, we have an intermediate lesson,

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
and not only is it intermediate, but it's a business lesson.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Yes, so today we're listening into a sales meeting,

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
and we're going to learn some great useful English to talk about sales strategies.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
So we're gonna learn English for sales strategies for making suggestions and for responding to suggestions.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Great, so why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview for today?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Vocabulary preview.

00:55.000 --> 01:05.000
So our vocabulary preview is a part of our lesson when we teach you some really important words that will help you to understand the dialogue better.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Okay, great, so that is what vocabulary preview is.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
We have two words for you today, and we can start off by looking at the first one.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Our first word today is drive sales.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Drive sales.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Drive sales.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
To drive sales, and that means.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
To increase sales.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Right, to sell more.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Exactly, so to drive sales.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Okay, so now let's look at our second word, and it's an interesting one, it's promotion.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Promotion.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Promotion.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Promotion.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
So Erica, what is a promotion exactly?

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay, so here, we're not really talking about getting a better job, right?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Okay, not like a job promotion.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
No, we're talking about a marketing strategy.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Okay, so I can give you an example.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Suppose that I want to buy shampoo.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Uh-huh.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
And if I go to the supermarket and I see buy one and get one free.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
So that's a two for one.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
That's a two for one promotion.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah, okay.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
That's a sales promotion.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Or perhaps the shampoo in the supermarket is less expensive than usual.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Okay.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah, usually maybe it costs five dollars, but today it costs four dollars.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
That's a sales promotion.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Great, so that's a really good marketing strategy.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Exactly, and we'll hear this word in our dialogue today.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Great, so we are ready to listen to our dialogue.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
It's going to be pretty fast, so it might be a little bit difficult to understand.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
But don't worry if you don't understand everything, because later in this lesson,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
we're going to explain all the important words and phrases.

02:38.000 --> 02:58.000
All right, people, we're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And we need to do it now.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I want concrete solutions.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
How do you plan to drive sales?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Roger.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market, so maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Lower our prices.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Not very creative.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
It'll never fly with one.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
What kind of thinking is that, geez?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Anyone have a better plan?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Natalie.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Perhaps a promotion.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Maybe a two for one offer or something like that.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
That's the same thing.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Bad idea.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Really bad idea.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Damn it, people.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Come on.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
The CEO will be here any minute.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Hello, Mr. Swan.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Hello, Mr. Swan.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Hello, Mr. Swan.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Do we have any ideas yet?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yes, Mr. Swan.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
We were kind of considering a two for one offer to get more competitive.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
A two for one promotion.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Hmm.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I kind of like the sound of that.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It sounds like something we should consider.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, exactly.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
That's just what I was thinking.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
In fact, it's a brilliant idea.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm glad we thought of that.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Very creative.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Okay, so an interesting manager, right?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I don't know about interesting.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Maybe I would think bad, manager.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
We're going to talk about him later on in the show.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
But now let's take a look at our language takeaway.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Language takeaway.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Okay, so language takeaway is the part of our lesson

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
where we teach you the most important words from the dialogue.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
All these words that we are going to focus on

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
can be found in today's dialogue.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Exactly.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
So we have three words for you today.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's look at the first one.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Match the competitors.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Match the competitors.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Match the competitors.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Match the competitors.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Great.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
So we have some examples for you

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
so you can listen and try and see

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
if you can figure out what match the competitors really means.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Example one.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
We guarantee that we can match the competitor's lowest price.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Example two.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
It's impossible for us to match the competitors.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Our costs are just too high.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Example three.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Do you think we can match our competitors' prices

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
and still keep our quality high?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Ah, okay, so I see that match the competitors

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
means to be as good as

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
or better than other companies in the same industry.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Exactly.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Match the competitors.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Alright, so let's move to our second word today for language takeaways

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
and it is in the market.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
In the market.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
In the market.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
In the market.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
We heard this phrase in the dialogue

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
and it means in the industry.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Exactly.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I can say, for example,

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
EnglishPod is the best languagePod in the market.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
So of all the podcasts that teach English,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
EnglishPod is the best.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Of course, no doubt about it.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I totally agree.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Alright, or I can give you another example.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
iPods are the most popular MP3 players in the market.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
So of all the MP3 players in the world, iPods are the most popular.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
So let's move to our final word for today and it is...

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
It'll never fly.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
It'll never fly.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It will never fly.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
So this phrase sounds a little bit strange.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I know.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Fly?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Are we talking about an airplane here?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
What's going on?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Exactly.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
But we're not.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
So we're going to give you some examples and try and guess what it'll never fly really means.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Example 1.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
This marketing plan will never fly.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
It's just too expensive.

07:19.000 --> 07:29.000
Example 2.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
What?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
You want to sell bikinis in Alaska?

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
That'll never fly.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Example 3.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Brad told me his idea for film script,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
but the story will never fly.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
So it means it won't work.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
It won't work.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
It's not a good idea.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
They'll never agree.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Exactly.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Great, so now we've seen a lot of useful phrases

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
and we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
But this time it's going to be slow.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
So you'll be able to understand a little bit better

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
and you'll be able to hear the words and phrases we were just talking about.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Alright, people, we're holding this meeting today

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
because we've got to do something about our sales

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
and we need to do it now.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I want concrete solutions.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
How do you plan to drive sales, Roger?

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
So maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Lower our prices.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Not very creative.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
It'll never fly with swan.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
What kind of thinking is that?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Geez.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Anybody else have a better plan?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Natalie?

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Perhaps a promotion.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Maybe a two-for-one offer or something like that.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
What?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
That's the same thing.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Bad idea.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Really bad idea.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Damn it, people, come on.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
Think the CEO will be here any minute.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Hello, Mr. Swan.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Oh, Mr. Swan.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Hello, Mr. Swan.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Do we have any ideas yet?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Yes, Mr. Swan.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
We were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
A two-for-one promotion?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Hmm.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I kind of like the sound of that.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
It sounds like something we should consider.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Exactly.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
That's just what I was thinking.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
In fact, that's a brilliant idea.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm glad we thought of that very creative.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Okay, great.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
I hope everyone understands a lot better now.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
And I hope everyone could listen out for some of those key words.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Right, so now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Fluency Builder.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
So with Fluency Builder, we try to help you increase your fluency.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
We take a word or phrase that you already know and show you how to say it a little bit more naturally.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
A little bit more like a native English speaker.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Right, and we have three of these words for you today.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Let's start with the first one.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Okay, so often students will say something like

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
I'll be here soon or I will arrive soon.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Right, and these sentences are correct.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
They're totally fine, but I think there's a better way to say this.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
Right, and we heard it in the dialogue, so let's listen to what the person in the dialogue said.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
The CEO will be here any minute.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
The CEO will be here any minute.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Okay, so be here any minute.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
He'll be here any minute.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
It just sounds a little bit more natural.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, I think I use this phrase quite often.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
He'll be here any minute.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
He'll be here soon.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Yeah.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Great.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Okay, so let's move on to our second phrase for Fluency Builder.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
So this phrase will help you to learn how to say I'm thinking about something in a better sounding way.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Right, so you can say something like

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
we are thinking about a sales strategy.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Or that sounds like something we should think about.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Right, and it's perfectly correct.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Yeah, there's no problem with this.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
But in the dialogue, we heard something a little bit different, so let's listen to it.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
It sounds like something we should consider.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
It sounds like something we should consider.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
So consider sounds like a pretty natural way of saying it, right?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah, and you know what, I think it sounds really kind of smart.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah, it sounds more formal even.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
A little more professional.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
It's a good word.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Okay, brilliant.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
So let's move on to our third word.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Marco, you already said our third word.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah, I actually did.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Brilliant.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
That's a great word right there.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
A lot of people might say that's a great idea or great.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
But in the dialogue, we heard another way of saying the same idea.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
That's a brilliant idea.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
That's a brilliant idea.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Okay, so this is great, but I would have to say that it's a little bit more British English.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah, I'd agree with you there, but I also think it sort of gives more power to this idea

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
that it's a good idea, brilliant idea.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And it's a really, really good idea.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
And I like that word.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Okay, so we're ready to listen to our dialogue again, a third time, but at its normal speed.

13:01.000 --> 13:09.000
All right, people, we're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
and we need to do it now.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I want concrete solutions.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
How do you plan to drive sales, Roger?

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
So maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Lower our prices.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Not very creative.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
It'll never fly with one.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
What kind of thinking is that, geez?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Anyone have a better plan?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Natalie.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Perhaps a promotion.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Maybe a two-for-one offer or something like that.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Wow, that's the same thing.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Bad idea.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Really bad idea.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Dammit, people, come on.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Think.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
The CEO will be here any minute.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Hello, Mr. Swan.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Hello, Mr. Swan.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Hello, Mr. Swan.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Do we have any ideas yet?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Yes, Mr. Swan.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
We were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
A two-for-one promotion.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Hmm.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
I kind of like the sound of that.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It sounds like something we should consider.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah, exactly.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
That's just what I was thinking.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
In fact, it's a brilliant idea.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
I'm glad we thought of that.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Very creative.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
All right, so listening to this dialogue

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
makes you think about this boss.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I'm pretty sure everyone has had a manager

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
or a supervisor that's similar to this guy.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Yeah, this boss, Clark.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
I would have to say he sounds like a terrible person to work for.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah, that's true.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
If you're a manager, you want to motivate your employees.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I think it's the most important thing a manager does

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
is to encourage his or her employees

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
and to help support them to grow

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
and to be better people in the job.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And this guy is totally not doing this.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
And you can tell because they are a little bit scared of talking

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
and he cuts them off with saying,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
oh, it's a bad idea.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Give me a better idea and stuff like that.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah, I could never work for a guy like this.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
You know, my first boss that I had

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
when I first entered the workforce,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I was in a very junior position

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
and I was working for a large company.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
And the general manager of the company,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
he was amazing.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
He was so encouraging.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
He knew every single employee's name, first name,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
and he would make an effort to stop

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
and say hello and ask them how things were going.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
And you know what, this left me with such a good feeling

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
about the company that I really wanted to work hard

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
for this company and try my best.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
And I think that I've never met such a great boss as this guy.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
No, I think that's true.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Definitely, if you have a boss that's encouraging

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
and motivating like that,

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
it makes you work harder and makes you feel

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
part of a really special team.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
And that's something we can all agree on

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
and I'm sure all our managers out there do the same.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Well, you know what?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I hope some of our listeners log on to our website

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
and maybe they can tell us some experiences

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
with bad managers or good managers

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
or if they are managers, how they handle things.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah, and hopefully they can use some of these great phrases

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
that we talked about today.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Great.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000

and really good resources to continue improving your English.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
That's right.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
So thanks for listening today, everyone.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
And until next time, this is goodbye.
