00:00.000 --> 00:06.440
Hello English learners, welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.440
My name is Marco.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.080
And I'm Erica.

00:09.080 --> 00:14.720
And today we are going to be looking at a very useful lesson because, well, sometimes

00:14.720 --> 00:16.560
you need to call a plumber.

00:16.560 --> 00:22.120
Okay, so first of all, why don't we start with vocabulary preview because I think we need

00:22.120 --> 00:23.680
to know this word, plumber.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.640
Very vocabulary preview.

00:25.640 --> 00:29.960
Alright, so on vocabulary preview today we're going to look at two words.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.400
And the first one is the one that we mentioned plumber.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.400
A plumber.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.400
So it's a person A plumber.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.400
Yep.

00:37.400 --> 00:43.480
And a plumber is the person who fixes everything in your house that is related to water, right?

00:43.480 --> 00:46.960
Okay, so he fixes the toilet, the sink, the shower.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.560
Yep, that's the plumber.

00:48.560 --> 00:53.800
And now the second word is obviously related to plumber and it's water pipes.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.160
Water pipes.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.160
Water pipes.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.160
The pipes.

00:57.160 --> 01:01.240
So the plumber fixes or looks at the water pipes as well.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
Yep.

01:02.240 --> 01:07.120
And those are a tube that carries water in and out of your house.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.600
Okay, so water pipes.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.400
You also have different types of pipes, like gas pipes.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
Yes.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
Okay.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.120
So what are we learning in this lesson?

01:16.120 --> 01:20.280
So in this lesson we're going to be learning how to describe when you have problems

01:20.280 --> 01:24.880
with plumbing, when you have problems in your sink or in your toilet and how you can

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
describe it.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.760
And so I think we should take a look at a dialogue for the first time and see what types

01:30.760 --> 01:43.880
of problems this woman is having with her plumbing.

01:43.880 --> 01:44.880
Good afternoon.

01:44.880 --> 01:45.880
Did you call for a plumber?

01:45.880 --> 01:47.360
Yes, yes, I did.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.360
Please come in.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.760
I'm so glad you came.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.000
This old house is falling apart.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.240
That means the bathroom.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.760
See, here.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.520
That's water leaking everywhere.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.520
I see.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.520
Let me have a look.

02:01.520 --> 02:06.600
That seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.120
Let me just get my plunger.

02:09.120 --> 02:16.440
No, that's not working either.

02:16.440 --> 02:21.320
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe is causing a blockage.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.320
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.240
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.800
She has always fashioned things down and toilet.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.960
You know how kids are?

02:29.960 --> 02:32.400
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.840
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed.

02:37.840 --> 02:40.640
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.840
That might lead to more problems in the future.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.120
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.320
I could have it all finished by today, if it's urgent.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.320
That would be great.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.000
It's an expensive.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Let's see.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I would say about $800.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
What?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
That's all that I'm making.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.360
All right, well, it sounds like she's having some big problems with her plumbing, but actually,

03:02.360 --> 03:05.880
I'm really interested that the plumber makes so much money.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.360
That is a very interesting thing, and we're going to talk a little bit about that later

03:09.360 --> 03:15.040
on, but I think we should look at those kind of difficult words that we found in the dialogue

03:15.040 --> 03:19.000
now in language takeaway.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.920
So we have five words here, all to do with a plumber and water pipes.

03:26.920 --> 03:32.920
Now, the first word, they talked about that there was water leaking everywhere.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.120
So you have water leaking.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.120
Water leaking.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.800
So to leak.

03:37.800 --> 03:42.320
When something leaks, it lets liquid come out when it shouldn't.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.520
Okay, when it shouldn't.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.520
Yep.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.520
So maybe you have a bottle of water and it's closed.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.520
Mm-hmm.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.560
But maybe there's a hole in the bottle.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
So it leaks.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.560
So it leaks.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.560
Yep.

03:52.560 --> 03:56.560
All right, and so there was water everywhere it was leaking, and maybe the reason was because

03:56.560 --> 03:58.840
the toilet is clogged.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.840
Okay, clogged.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.480
The toilet is clogged.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.480
Clogged.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.360
Now, what does it mean if the toilet is clogged?

04:06.360 --> 04:10.840
If the toilet is clogged, there is something that stops the water from going down.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.080
Okay, so there's something blocking it.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.080
Yep.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.840
Okay, a clogged toilet.

04:15.840 --> 04:16.840
Mm-hmm.

04:16.840 --> 04:23.080
Now, the plumber said that it might be clogged and he tried to fix it with a plunger.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080
A plunger.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.080
A plunger.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.080
A plunger.

04:26.080 --> 04:30.840
Okay, so it's kind of hard to describe what a plunger is.

04:30.840 --> 04:43.600
So why don't we listen to the sound a plunger makes in a toilet?

04:43.600 --> 04:48.360
So the plunger is the tool that you use to unplug a toilet.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.160
Okay, that's what you use a plunger.

04:51.160 --> 04:55.360
So the plunger didn't work, and he wasn't able to fix the toilet, and he said that

04:55.360 --> 04:58.480
there's something in the pipes causing a blockage.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.640
All right, so our next word, a blockage.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.640
Blockage.

05:02.640 --> 05:08.040
Well, a blockage is something that stops water from flowing.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.440
Okay, so something is blocking it.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
Mm-hmm.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.840
So you have blockage.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.440
Yep.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
Very good.

05:14.440 --> 05:18.480
And we have one more word on language takeaway, and that word is faucet.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.480
A faucet.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.480
A faucet.

05:20.480 --> 05:26.320
All right, so the faucet is the part of the sink that lets water come out.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.760
Okay, so you have a faucet in your sink.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.360
Yeah, so you put your hands under the faucet so you can wash them.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.120
Okay, that's the faucet.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.120
Yep.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.120
Very good.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.840
So now that we've learned about these different tools and these different ways

05:38.840 --> 05:44.520
of describing problems with your plumbing, let's listen to this dialogue another time,

05:44.520 --> 05:52.560
a little bit slower now, and then we'll come back and take a look at some great phrases.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.560
Good afternoon.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.960
Did you call for a plumber?

05:54.960 --> 05:56.920
Yes, yes, I did.

05:56.920 --> 05:57.920
Please come in.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.000
I'm so glad you came.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.240
This old house is falling apart.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.760
Come on into the bathroom.

06:04.760 --> 06:05.760
See?

06:05.760 --> 06:06.760
Here.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.760
There's water leaking everywhere.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.200
I see.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.600
Let me have a look.

06:11.600 --> 06:16.280
It seems that your toilet is clogged, and that's why it won't flush.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.240
Let me just get my plunger.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.240
No, that's not workin' either.

06:21.240 --> 06:26.240
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipes that's causing a

06:26.240 --> 06:27.240
blockage.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.200
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.040
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.280
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.960
You know how kids are.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.440
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

06:41.440 --> 06:46.880
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they should also be changed.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.000
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.640
That might lead to more problems in the future.

06:52.640 --> 06:57.240
I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.240
I could have it all finished by today, if it's urgent.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.720
That would be great.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.640
Is it expensive?

07:03.640 --> 07:04.640
Let's see.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.640
I would say about $800.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.640
What?

07:07.640 --> 07:12.080
That's more than I make in a day, and I'm a hot-sejun.

07:12.080 --> 07:18.600
Oh, we've got three phrases that you can use when you need to describe something not

07:18.600 --> 07:23.600
working with the pipes, so let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.240
Fluency Builder

07:25.240 --> 07:30.960
So the lady called the plumber and he arrived, and she described her house as old,

07:30.960 --> 07:33.360
and that it's falling apart.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.000
It's falling apart.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.840
This old house is falling apart.

07:37.840 --> 07:42.680
So when something is falling apart, it's old, and it's breaking slowly.

07:42.680 --> 07:48.400
Exactly, so we can say the house is falling apart, or maybe this old car is falling apart.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.120
You can also use it for people, oh, I'm getting so old and falling apart.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.120
Very good.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.120
So you're getting sick, or you're very good.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.360
Now for our second word.

07:58.360 --> 08:04.480
Well the woman said that maybe her daughter was flushing things down the toilets.

08:04.480 --> 08:08.360
Okay, so to flush something down the toilet.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.400
To flush something down the toilets.

08:10.400 --> 08:19.040
So before we explain this, let's listen to a toilet being flushed.

08:19.040 --> 08:32.120
Okay, so that's the sound of flushing, and when you flush something down the toilet,

08:32.120 --> 08:33.120
what happens?

08:33.160 --> 08:36.560
Basically you throw something into the toilet, and then you flush it.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.560
So it goes away.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.320
All right, so flushing something down the toilet.

08:40.320 --> 08:46.520
Well she also talked about the faucet, and it wasn't shutting off properly.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.520
Shudding off.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.160
To shut off.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.280
Okay, shut off.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.440
When you shut something off, you turn it off.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.760
Okay, so we can say to shut something off or to shut off something.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.160
Right, so hey Marco, can you shut off the computer?

09:02.200 --> 09:05.680
Okay, or I can say, can you shut the faucet off?

09:05.680 --> 09:06.680
Exactly, great.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.080
So we took a look at these three phrases that will help you describe again.

09:10.080 --> 09:16.160
These situations are problems that may happen in your bathroom or with liquids.

09:16.160 --> 09:21.120
And well, let's listen to the dialogue for the last time, and we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

09:21.120 --> 09:32.640
Good afternoon, did you call for a plumber?

09:32.640 --> 09:36.240
Yes, yes, I did, please come in.

09:36.240 --> 09:43.320
I'm so glad you came, this old house is falling apart, come into the bathroom.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.120
See, here, there's water leaking everywhere.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.120
I see.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.120
Let me have a look.

09:49.520 --> 09:53.360
That seems that your toilet is clogged, and that's why it won't flush.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.120
Let me just get my plunger.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.440
No, that's not working either.

10:03.440 --> 10:08.080
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe is causing a blockage.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.080
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.040
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.600
She has always fashioned things down in toilet.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.720
You know how kids are?

10:16.720 --> 10:19.040
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

10:19.120 --> 10:24.560
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.360
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.680
That might lead to more problems in the future.

10:29.680 --> 10:32.960
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.120
I could have it all finished by today, if it's urgent.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.400
That would be great.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.840
Is it expensive?

10:37.840 --> 10:39.120
Let's see.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.880
I would say about $800.

10:40.880 --> 10:41.680
What?

10:41.680 --> 10:45.680
That's one of my making a day, and I'm...

10:45.760 --> 10:50.320
Well, we heard in this dialogue that this plumber is making about $800.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.120
That's a lot of money.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.560
That's a lot of money.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.720
And actually, this in many countries is not far from the truth.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.760
That's right. Like, for example, in Canada,

11:00.960 --> 11:02.640
there is a shortage.

11:02.640 --> 11:06.640
There's not enough of these people like plumber's

11:06.640 --> 11:09.600
who can do this type of work, so they can charge a lot of money.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.000
So this type of work is called a...

11:12.000 --> 11:13.840
He's not really a professional, right?

11:13.840 --> 11:18.160
Right. But he is a trades person because he works in a trade.

11:18.160 --> 11:24.160
Okay, so like a plumber and a nutrition person that paints your house,

11:25.040 --> 11:26.320
those are all trades.

11:26.320 --> 11:26.960
Yep.

11:26.960 --> 11:33.440
Well, it is true because now many people don't want to learn or do these types of trade,

11:33.440 --> 11:37.120
because well, it's not considered to be such a great job, right?

11:37.120 --> 11:42.480
