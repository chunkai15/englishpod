00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to English Pod, my name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
And today we're going to be going to one of those places that is really common, right?

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
That's right.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
We're going to the hair salon.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
The hair salon, or maybe also called a barber shop.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
I guess in this case it's a barber shop because it's a man who's getting a haircut.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Okay, so before we see what happens in this barber shop,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
let's take a look at some of the vocabulary we might encounter in vocabulary preview.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Okay, we're going to look at two words that you'll hear in this dialogue.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
And the first one is trim trim.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
A trim.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
All right, so when you trim something, you cut just a little bit of it.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
All right, so if I go to the hair salon to get a trim,

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
you are going to cut only a little bit of your hair.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Okay, you're not going to change the style and make it look different.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Okay, so a trim.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
And I think here we've seen that it can be a verb and an noun, right?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Okay, so I'm going to get a trim.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Yes.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Or I want you to trim my hair.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
That's right.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
All right.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And what about our next word?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Fancy.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Fancy.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Fancy.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
So fancy.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Now we know that this word maybe is related to something luxury.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Or formal or something like that.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Right, but in this case, or in this context,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
we're going to be using it a little bit different.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
That's right.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Here in this dialogue, we'll hear nothing too fancy.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Or nothing too complicated.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Nothing too different.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Okay, so we don't want anything too fancy.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
All right, but with these two words in mind,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I think we're ready to listen to the dialogue.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Hello there.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Come on here.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Don't just stand there.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Come and take a seat.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Um, okay.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, I just want a trim.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Nothing too fancy.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, my gosh.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Your hair is amazing.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
So silky.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
So shiny.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I am going to work my magic on your hair.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
You hear me?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
You are going to look like a million bucks.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Um, can you make sure my sideburns are even

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
and you just take a little off the top?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Don't you worry.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I'll take care of everything.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Oh, my God.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I just love your curly hair.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
It's so fluffy and cute.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
You should totally let it grow out.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
An Afro would look great on you.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Um, no.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Okay.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
But you are going to be my masterpiece.

02:51.000 --> 03:20.000
Okay, so I think maybe his haircut is not quite what he expected.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
I think he trusted the stylist a little bit too much.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I think the stylist had too many red bulls.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I think he's very hyper.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Maybe that was his problem.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
All right.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
So why don't we take a look now at some of the language

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
that we saw in language takeaway?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Language takeaway.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
So I guess the stylist really thought this guy had nice hair, right?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
We heard how he described his hair.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
He said it was so silky silky silky.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
All right.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
So we know the word silk.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Mm-hmm.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
A material very soft and smooth material.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And when something is silky, it's very soft and smooth.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
All right.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
So silky hair.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Or silky skin.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
All right.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
So silky.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
So he said he had silky and shiny hair.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
shiny shiny shiny.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
All right.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
So we know what shiny is.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Do we?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Guess we do.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Okay.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
What?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
So something that is shiny is you can see yourself in it.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Like gold is shiny.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Or silver is shiny.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
All right.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Or if you look in the back of a CD, it's shiny.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
So the light bounces off things that are shiny.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
All right.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Now getting into more hairstyle vocabulary.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
He wanted to make sure that his sideburns were even sideburns.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
All right.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
So sideburns.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
All right.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Well sideburns are things that men have.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
All right.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Women don't have sideburns.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
No.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
So it's kind of like a beard.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Mm-hmm.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
And it's the hair that grows on your cheeks near your ears.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Okay.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Those are your sideburns.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yes.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
And now also the hair stylist suggested that he should let his hair grow out.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Grow out.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Grow out.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Let your hair grow out.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
All right.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
So what does that mean exactly?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Make let your hair get longer.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
So you can say let your hair grow.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
But I guess it's more common to hear.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Well maybe it just means something a little bit different.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
If I let my hair grow, I might let it grow a little bit.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Make it a little bit longer.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
But if I let my hair grow out, maybe it's short now.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
And I'll let it get really long.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Okay.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
So to let your hair grow out is to really change the length.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
All right.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Very good.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
So let your hair grow out.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
And our last word on language takeaway today.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Afro.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Afro.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Afro.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
So if this guy let his curly hair grow out.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
He would have an Afro.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
And Afro.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Right.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
So now this hairstyle was very popular in the 70s.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
That's right.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
It's like a big round curly fluffy ball of hair.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Exactly.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
So that's in Afro.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
We'll post some pictures on the website for you to get a clear idea of what this looks like.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
All right.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
So I think now we are ready to listen to our dialogue for the second time.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And then we'll come back and look at some phrases.

06:15.000 --> 06:25.000
Hello there.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Come on in.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Don't just stand there.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Come and take a seat.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Um, okay.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Well, I just want to trim nothing too fancy.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh my gosh.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Your hair is amazing.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
So silky.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
So shiny.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I am going to work my magic on your hair.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
You hear me?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
You are going to look like a million bucks.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Okay.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Um, can you make sure my sideburns are even.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
And you just take a little off the top.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Don't you worry.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I'll take care of everything.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Oh my god.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I just love your curly hair.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
It's so fluffy and cute.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
You should totally let it grow out.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And Afro would look great on you.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Um, no.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Okay.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
But you're going to be my masterpiece.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Okay.

07:12.000 --> 07:24.000
So we have some phrases here that you might hear in a hair salon or in a barber shop.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
So why don't we look at those now and fluency builder?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Fluency builder.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
The hair stylist said, don't just stand there.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Don't just stand there.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
All right.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Don't just stand there.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
So this is an interesting phrase, Marco.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
I mean, it's made up of really simple words, right?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Right.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
But actually, those words make it in order that's a little bit different.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
So why don't we hear a few examples to help us understand how to use this phrase?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Example one.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Don't just stand there.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
Help me take these boxes into the house.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Example two.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
The house is on fire.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Just stand there.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Go to fire department.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Example three.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Don't just stand there in the rain.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Come inside.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Okay.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
So basically, we can understand that if somebody tells you don't just stand there.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
They are expecting you to do something.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
We might use this phrase.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
But when somebody is not doing what we think they should do.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Okay.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
When action is required.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Exactly.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Okay.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
So why don't we move on to our next phrase now?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Look like a million bucks.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
You look like a million bucks.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
So when someone looks like a million bucks, they look really, really good.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yeah.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
So that is a very common way of just saying you look very good,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
or something looks like a million bucks.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
So it can be for a person or a thing, right?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Exactly.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Okay.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And our final phrase.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And this one is really common in barber shops.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Take a little off the top.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Take a little off the top.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Take a little off the top.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
So that basically means cut a little bit on top.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Exactly.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
And now can I say take a little off the sides?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
You can say that as well.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
All right.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
So take a little off the top.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Take a little off the sides.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Okay.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
So with all this great hair cutting language, why don't we listen to our dialogue?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
One last time.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Hold there.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Come on here.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Don't just stand there.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Come and take a seat.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Um, okay.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, I just want to trim that thing to fancy.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh, my gosh.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Your hair is amazing.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
So silky.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
So shiny.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I am going to work my magic on your hair.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
You hear me?

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
You are going to look like a million bucks.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Okay.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Um, can you make sure my sideburns are even.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
And you just take a little off the top.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Don't you worry.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I'll take care of everything.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh, my god.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I just love your curly hair.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
It's so fluffy and cute.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
You should totally let it grow out.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
An Afro would look great on you.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Um, no.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Okay.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
But you are going to be my masterpiece.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Here it is.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
All right.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
So now talking about hair styles and different types of hair.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
There are some interesting ones that maybe aren't so fashionable anymore, right?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Um, actually English has a lot of really cool words to describe haircut.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
So let's start with a couple of them.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
For example, a mallet, a mallet.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
So this is when your hair is really short on top and really long in the back.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Right.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
So the sides and the top are really short.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But in the back, you have long hair.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Um, in Canada, we call that a shorty, shorty long back.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Shorty, shorty long back.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
We also call it hockey hair.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Hockey hair.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Or even all business up front.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
All party behind.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Well, Canadians are obviously very into this hairstyle.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
It's unfortunately true.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
All right.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
We also have, for example, a mallet.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Hmm, popular amongst the punk rock kids.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Exactly.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
So you shave your head on the sides.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
You leave a little like stripe of long hair on top.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Thinking up long hair.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Okay. And that's a moha.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
What about a flat top?

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
Oh, um, popular with law enforcement agents and serial killers.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
So basically it's short hair on the sides.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And short and flat hair on the top.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Right. So you have a hair.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
You have a box.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Right. You have flat on.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Kind of like your hair cut.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I do not have a flat top for all of you out there.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Uh, but I did use to have a crew cut.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Oh, crew cut.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
A crew cut.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah. Like an army haircut.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Right. So very short on the sides.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And a little bit long on top.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah. Okay.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Um, and our last one, my actual personal.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Least favorite haircut.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Dreadlocks.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Dreadlocks.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
All right. So so dreadlocks are like knots of hair.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Um, it looks like you haven't watched your hair in about seven years.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Right.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Those are dreadlocks.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Very popular among, like,

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Rostopharian.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Sure.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Or like, um, young hippie kids.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yeah.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
hippies, right?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Very good.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
So about in your countries,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
what different hair styles are popular there.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I know that Japanese hair styles are really cool.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Yeah. That's right.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Japanese haircuts can be pretty awesome.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Right. So tell us all about it.
