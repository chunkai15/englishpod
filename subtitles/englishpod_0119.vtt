00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we have a fun and scary dialogue.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
That's right, this lesson is full of language you can use to talk about being scared.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
Alright, so we're going to be looking at a scary lesson today and we have nothing to preview, so let's listen to this dialogue and see why everyone is so scared.

00:29.000 --> 00:41.000
Hey, why are we at the scary looking mansion? It's like ultra spooky.

00:41.000 --> 00:52.000
I told you already, Shabby. The owner of the house says there's a ghost hunting his house, so we have to go in and investigate.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I don't like this.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Come on guys, stop being such cowards. It's a mystery and an adventure.

01:01.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's play it again to me the creeps. Seriously guys, let's get out of here. I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
That luck came from this room. Let's go and check it out.

01:25.000 --> 01:36.000
Look, a ghost run.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, that sounds really scary, but actually it kind of reminds me of another TV show.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
Very similar to another TV show, but it's different.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
Okay, but some interesting language that you can use to talk about things that are scary, so why don't we look at that now in language takeaway?

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Language takeaway.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
So let's start with the very first line of our dialogue.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Shabby described the mansion to be ultra spooky.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
It's ultra spooky.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
So okay, we've got two interesting words here. Ultra and spooky. Now spooky is scary, right?

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
It's a little bit scary. It maybe makes you feel a little bit uncomfortable or maybe it makes you feel a little bit scared.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay, it's not very scared. Not super scared.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
But ultra spooky.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
So ultra is another way of saying super or very or really spooky.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
So if it's ultra spooky, then it's very scary.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Okay.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
Alright, so our next word, they said that in the house, there is a ghost haunting the house.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Okay, there is a ghost haunting his house.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Okay, so the verb to hunt.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Okay, to hunt.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
So the ghost is coming to the house frequently and not letting them live in peace.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
When a ghost hunt something, it visits it often and scares it.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Exactly.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Now they were all afraid and they didn't want to go in.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
And so Wilma called everyone cowards.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Stop being such cowards.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Cowards.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
So a coward.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
A coward is a person that's not brave.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
A person who's scared of everything.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Exactly.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
So they were being cowards.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
They were afraid.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
So that's why they didn't want to go in.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Well speaking of being afraid.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Shabby said, I'm getting goose bumps.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Goose bumps.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
To get goose bumps.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Alright, to get goose bumps.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Now, goose bumps, it may sound a little bit strange.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
But it's very easy when you're scared or maybe you're cold.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
The skin on your arms or on your back gets a little bit bumpy.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
So your skin looks like chicken skin.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Exactly.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Chicken skin.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And that's actually how we call it in Spanish.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Chicken skin.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
But this is goose bumps.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
So I guess it's kind of similar.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
A goose?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Same idea.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Goose bumps.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Alright, and finally, Scruffy said,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
A scaredy cat.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
A scaredy cat.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
You're a scaredy cat.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Well, a scaredy cat is not really a cat, right?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
No, no, no.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's a person who's afraid of everything.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Okay.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Similar to a coward.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
But more informal.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Much more informal.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
So somebody is a scaredy cat.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
And I think even a little bit more juvenile.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
As a dog.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Children use it.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
As adults, you wouldn't say, he's a scaredy cat.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Alright, great.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
So some interesting scary language.

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
I think we need to hear it one more time slowed down in the dialogue.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Anyway, why are we at the scary looking mansion?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
It's like ultra spooky.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I told you already, Shabby.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
The owner of the house says there's a ghost hunting his house.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So we have to go in and investigate.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I don't like this.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Come on, guys.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Stop being such cowards.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
It's a mystery and an adventure.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Let's play and get me the creeps.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Seriously, guys?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Let's get out of here.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
That laugh came from this room.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Let's go and check it out.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Look, a ghost run!

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Okay, so now that we understand all the vocabulary we saw in language takeaway,

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
why don't we take a look at two phrases now in Fluency Builder?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Fluency Builder.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, Shabby said, we're at this scary looking mansion.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Scary looking mansion.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So a scary looking mansion.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Okay, so the mansion looks scary.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
All right, so a mansion is a big house, right?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
That looks very scary.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
Now, this is a really useful and helpful pattern you can use with English.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Something looking, so adjective looking.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Right, so you can say good looking.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And there's lots of examples.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
So why don't we hear a few more now?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Example one.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
As making me nervous, he's really creepy looking.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Example two.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I saw the craziest looking house today.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
It was built upside down.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Example three.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
What a nice looking dog.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Can I pet him?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
All right, great examples.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
And now we know how we can combine looking with different adjectives.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Our next phrase, Shabby said,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
This place gives me the creeps.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
All right, gives me the creeps.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
To give someone the creeps.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
So if something gives you the creeps.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
It makes you feel uncomfortable and scared.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Maybe scared, maybe nervous.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Okay, so why don't we give some examples.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I could say, hey, Marco, see that guy over there.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
He keeps looking at me.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
He's giving me the creeps.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Okay, all right, can say clowns give me the creeps.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh, that's right, you're afraid of clowns.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay, give me the creeps.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
All right, well, it's a really helpful useful phrase.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
To use when you're talking about being afraid.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Now why don't we listen to the dialogue one final time.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
Hey, why are we at the starting looking mansion?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
It's like all truth.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I told you already, Shabby.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
The owner of the house says there's a ghost hunting his house.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
So we have to go in and investigate.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
I don't like this.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Come on, guys.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Stop being such cowards.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
It's a mystery and an adventure.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Let's play as it gives me the creeps.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Seriously, guys, let's get out of here.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
That luck came from this room.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Let's go and check it out.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Look, a ghost run.

08:15.000 --> 08:29.000
Okay, so an interesting dialogue about ghost and haunted houses.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
So what do you think, Erica?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Do you believe in ghosts?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Have you ever seen a ghost?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
No, I totally do not believe in ghosts,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
but I understand that you disagree with me.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, I've experienced strange things,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
but I don't know if it was a ghost or an alien.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
I don't know, it could have been anything.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
An alien.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
An invisible alien.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Okay.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
So what happened?

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Well, once I was having dinner with my parents and we had a table

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
and on top of the table there was a glass full of water.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And all of a sudden it started to move across the table

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
and then it started to spin while it moved.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
So was there an earthquake or something happening?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
No, nothing.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
We were just the only thing on the whole table that was moving was that.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
And we all just kind of stared at the glass moving

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
and we didn't know what to do.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
And then my mom started kind of giggling and nervous laugh

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
and we really didn't know what happened.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Now, I understand that in Latin America,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
people are more superstitious.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
They're more, they believe more in ghosts, right?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Exactly.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
In Latin America, people are very superstitious.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
They believe in ghosts or in spirits.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Or we have a lot of urban legends about like a leprechaun

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
that lives under a bridge.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Or somebody's grandma that comes and haunts them

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
or visits them at night and stuff like that.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
So yeah, Latin American people are very superstitious in this sense.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah, I think in Anglo countries,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
it's a little bit less common to say that you believe in ghosts.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Maybe inside you, you think ghosts are true,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
but you wouldn't really tell people that.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Right.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
I think the difference would be that you have a different type of superstition.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
Like people are afraid of black cats or the floor or the number 13.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah, or opening your umbrella in a house.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Exactly.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
So because they consider it to be bad luck,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
but not because something like a ghost or an alien is going to come out and eat them.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
So listeners, why don't you tell us what you think about ghosts?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Are people superstitious in your country?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Did they believe in ghosts?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
and let us know and we'll see you guys there.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, thanks for downloading and goodbye.
