00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Hello English learners and welcome to English Pod, my name is Marco.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.400
And I'm Erica.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.680
Erica, today we are really excited, right?

00:09.680 --> 00:14.000
Yeah, we've got a great lesson today, all about real English.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.280
Exactly, English that you hear in movies and TV shows.

00:17.280 --> 00:22.920
Yeah, speaking of movies, today's podcast takes place at the movies.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.040
Exactly, and that's why it's so fun today.

00:25.040 --> 00:25.720
Uh-huh.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.680
Okay, great, so before we listen to our dialogue,

00:28.680 --> 00:32.680
let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.800
Vocabulary preview.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.760
In today's vocabulary preview, we have two words.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.720
And the first word is inconsiderate.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.000
Inconsiderate.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.320
Inconsiderate.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.440
So Erica, what is it when someone is inconsiderate?

00:47.440 --> 00:53.200
If someone's inconsiderate, they're not thinking about the feelings of other people.

00:53.200 --> 00:57.680
Right, so for example, yesterday I was on the subway and it was full, right?

00:57.720 --> 01:02.560
And an old lady was standing there and no one got up to give her their seat.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.440
That was pretty inconsiderate.

01:04.440 --> 01:09.000
Great, so now let's take a look at our second word and it's keep it down.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.280
Keep it down.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.360
Keep it down.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.000
Keep it down.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.480
So why don't we listen to some examples on how we use keep it down so we can understand?

01:20.440 --> 01:21.680
Example one.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.360
Excuse me, do you mind keeping it down?

01:30.360 --> 01:32.520
It's after midnight.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.000
Okay, sorry.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.960
Example two.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.160
I'm trying to study.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.720
Do you mind keeping it down?

01:50.520 --> 01:51.840
Example three.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.280
You mind keeping it down?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.280
Trying to watch the game.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.480
So that means be quiet.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.280
Yes, don't make so much noise.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.360
I used to hear this one all the time from my mother.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.480
I think we all did when we were children.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.480
Yeah.

02:09.480 --> 02:12.640
Okay, so now let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.840
It's going to be kind of fast.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.040
But don't worry about it if you can't understand everything.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.040
But don't worry about it if you can't understand everything.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.440
By the end of today's lesson, you will understand this dialogue.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.520
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.000
It's so inconsiderate.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Don't worry about it.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.760
It's not such a big deal or so.

02:50.760 --> 02:51.760
No.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.200
I can't hear a thing.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.000
Excuse me.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.760
Can you keep it down?

02:55.760 --> 02:56.360
Sure.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.360
Sorry about that.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.120
Someone's phone is ringing.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.120
Honey, I think it's your phone.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.640
Did you forget to switch it off?

03:12.440 --> 03:13.640
I know.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.160
You're right.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.560
That's so embarrassing.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.040
Do you mind keeping it down?

03:18.040 --> 03:19.280
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.560
I hate it when people's phones ring when I'm watching a movie.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.880
I think everyone gets kind of angry.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.280
But we're going to talk about this a little bit later.

03:36.280 --> 03:41.160
Why don't we take a look now at our language takeaway?

03:41.160 --> 03:43.680
Language takeaway.

03:43.680 --> 03:48.920
So the language takeaway is our most important words for today's lesson.

03:48.920 --> 03:53.480
And our first word today is not such a big deal.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.800
Not such a big deal.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.520
Not such a big deal.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.160
So when something is not a big deal, it's...

04:01.160 --> 04:02.320
Not a big problem.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.440
It's not important, right?

04:03.440 --> 04:04.280
Exactly.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.960
Okay, let's listen to some examples.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.200
Example one.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.280
I can't get these files to you by tomorrow.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.280
It's okay.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.280
It's not such a big deal.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.040
Example two.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.840
I'm really sorry.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.360
I'm going to be 10 minutes late for the meeting.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.960
It's not such a big deal.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.360
Peter and Liam are late too.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.400
Now let's look at our second word.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.440
And it's switch it off.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.800
Switch it off.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.080
Switch it off.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.760
Switch it off.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.160
So this word means to turn it off.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.440
To turn something off.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.160
Now we can use it in three different ways.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.400
Yeah, this one is a little bit complicated

04:52.400 --> 04:54.640
because it changes a little bit

04:54.640 --> 04:56.200
depending on how you use it.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.760
So Marco, I think you've got some examples for us.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.840
Right, so for example, I can say...

05:01.840 --> 05:03.840
Did you switch off your phone?

05:03.840 --> 05:07.320
Or you could say, did you switch your phone off?

05:07.320 --> 05:11.000
Right, or simply you can ask, did you switch it off?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.400
I think this one is a little bit hard.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.960
Let's look at a couple more examples.

05:15.960 --> 05:20.360
Okay, so I can say, for example, switch off the TV.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.960
Switch the TV off.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.520
Or switch it off.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.640
Yeah, I think that's a little bit more clear.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.560
But you know what, we even had trouble

05:27.560 --> 05:28.640
with that one, didn't we?

05:28.640 --> 05:31.560
Yeah, we had to do it a couple of times.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.200
Okay, now let's look at our last word

05:34.200 --> 05:36.800
and it's can't hear a thing.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.320
Can't hear a thing.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.960
I can't hear a thing.

05:39.960 --> 05:44.960
Okay, we have some examples for this phrase, so let's listen.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.960
Example one.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.960
What's going on in there?

05:51.960 --> 05:54.960
I don't know, I can't hear a thing.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.960
Example two.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.960
What?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.960
I'm sorry, this music is too loud.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.960
I can't hear a thing.

06:05.960 --> 06:10.960
So that's like saying, I can't hear.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.960
Exactly, I can't hear anything.

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
It's too loud.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.960
Right, so now we are ready to listen

06:16.960 --> 06:18.960
to our dialogue a second time.

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
It's going to be slower.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.960
This time listen for some of the key words we were explaining.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.960
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.960
It's so inconsiderate.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.960
Don't worry about it.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.960
It's not such a big deal.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.960
I can't hear a thing.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.960
Excuse me, can you keep it down?

06:44.960 --> 06:47.960
Sure, sorry about that.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.960
Someone's phone is ringing.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.960
Honey, I think it's your phone.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.960
Did you forget to switch it off?

06:56.960 --> 06:59.960
Oh no, you're right.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.960
That's so embarrassing.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.960
Do you mind keeping it down?

07:05.960 --> 07:08.960
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.960
Okay, great now with the dialogue slower.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.960
It's really understandable.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.960
Yeah, I think you could catch those key words a lot better.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.960
Perfect, so now we are ready to look at putting it together.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.960
Putting it together.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.960
So I'm putting it together.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.960
We help you use a great phrase in different ways.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.960
And today's phrase is,

07:31.960 --> 07:32.960
Do you mind?

07:32.960 --> 07:33.960
Do you mind?

07:33.960 --> 07:35.960
Do you mind?

07:35.960 --> 07:41.960
Okay, so let's listen to some examples on how you can use this phrase in different situations.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.960
Example 1.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.960
Do you mind holding my coat for me?

07:50.960 --> 07:52.960
Example 2.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.960
Oh, I forgot my wallet.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.960
Do you mind paying for dinner?

08:00.960 --> 08:02.960
Example 3.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.960
Do you mind turning off your phone?

08:13.960 --> 08:16.960
So this phrase is usually pretty polite.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.960
I could say to you, Marco,

08:17.960 --> 08:20.960
Do you mind holding my coat for me?

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
And that's really polite.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.960
Yeah, so what do you mind?

08:22.960 --> 08:25.960
Do you mind our very polite phrases?

08:25.960 --> 08:28.960
But depending on your voice and how you use your tone,

08:28.960 --> 08:31.960
it could be a little bit sarcastic, right?

08:31.960 --> 08:34.960
Yeah, it could be a little bit rude, if you say,

08:34.960 --> 08:36.960
Would you mind keeping it down?

08:36.960 --> 08:38.960
Exactly, like we heard in our dialogue.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.960
Yeah, so that's not so polite.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.960
Yeah, exactly.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.960
I mean, in English, you have to be careful because your tone of voice

08:44.960 --> 08:47.960
tells the other person how you're feeling if you're angry, sad,

08:47.960 --> 08:49.960
or just like in any other language.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.960
Yeah, that's true.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.960
So I mean, I'm using a phrase like,

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
Don't mind is a great phrase,

08:54.960 --> 08:57.960
but make sure you keep a positive tone in your voice.

08:57.960 --> 08:58.960
Exactly.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.960
So now that we've talked about all these great things,

09:01.960 --> 09:04.960
we can listen to the dialogue a third time,

09:04.960 --> 09:06.960
but it'll be at its normal speed.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.960
What do you call yourself?

09:09.960 --> 09:12.960
I'm only a little bit of a fan of yours.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.960
It's got this, it's got to make it much easier.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.960
That way you can make it much easier.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.960
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.960
It's so inconsiderate.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.960
Don't worry about it, it's not such a big deal or so long.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.960
Oh, I can't hear a thing!

09:29.960 --> 09:32.960
Excuse me, can you keep it down?

09:32.960 --> 09:34.960
Sure, sorry about that.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.960
What's going on?

09:39.960 --> 09:41.960
Oh, what's going on?

09:41.960 --> 09:43.960
Someone's phone is ringing.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.960
Honey, I think it's your phone.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.960
Did you forget to switch it off?

09:49.960 --> 09:50.960
I know.

09:50.960 --> 09:51.960
You're right.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.960
That's so embarrassing.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.960
Do you mind keeping it down?

09:55.960 --> 09:57.960
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.960
So I know that in different countries,

10:04.960 --> 10:07.960
there are different habits about watching movies.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.960
Yeah, that's definitely true, Erica.

10:09.960 --> 10:10.960
What's it like in Canada?

10:10.960 --> 10:14.960
Well, in Canada, it's really common to eat popcorn and candy

10:14.960 --> 10:17.960
and maybe chips while you're watching a movie.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.960
But if you're phone rings in the movie theater,

10:20.960 --> 10:22.960
this is a big problem.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.960
I imagine it is.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.960
I mean, I would be upset also.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.960
What about an Ecuador?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.960
Well, an Ecuador and in South America,

10:30.960 --> 10:33.960
usually people can bring in food from the outside.

10:33.960 --> 10:34.960
Really?

10:34.960 --> 10:36.960
Yeah, so it's not really uncommon,

10:36.960 --> 10:38.960
depending on the city,

10:38.960 --> 10:40.960
to find people bringing in chicken

10:40.960 --> 10:43.960
or some sort of like really smelly food.

10:43.960 --> 10:44.960
No way.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.960
So you get either really hungry or really upset,

10:47.960 --> 10:49.960
but that's what happens.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.960
You know, I used to live in Switzerland.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.960
And in Switzerland, you would have to eat before you watch the movie.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.960
There was no popcorn, no soda,

10:56.960 --> 10:58.960
no candy inside the movie theater.

10:58.960 --> 10:59.960
Can you imagine that?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.960
I could not live with that

11:01.960 --> 11:03.960
because the whole purpose of going to the movies

11:03.960 --> 11:06.960
is to have some popcorn and relax and have a good time.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.960
You can't have a movie without popcorn.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.960
Exactly.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.960
Okay, so we've talked a lot about how to ask someone to be quiet today.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.960
And I hope that you'll go out and try a few of these phrases

11:16.960 --> 11:18.960
