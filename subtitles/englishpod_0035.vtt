Hello English learners. Welcome to English Pod. I'm joined here today with

00:04.400 --> 00:09.360
Erica and my name is Marco and we're going to be looking at an office lesson today.

00:09.360 --> 00:15.040
That's right. We've got a lesson about describing somebody who's not such a good employee.

00:15.040 --> 00:20.240
Right. So we're going to be talking about how to describe this type of situation and

00:20.240 --> 00:26.240
a language for making your point. Yes. So let's look at some vocabulary from the dialogue in

00:26.240 --> 00:33.760
vocabulary preview. Very vocabulary preview. So two words today. The first one is a good

00:33.760 --> 00:41.600
fit. A good fit. A good fit. So when we're talking about an employee and he's a good fit,

00:41.600 --> 00:46.240
it means he's suitable for the job. Yes. He's suitable for the job or for the company.

00:46.240 --> 00:52.240
Or for the company, right? So the opposite would be not a good fit. Exactly. The title of today's

00:52.880 --> 01:00.240
right. And our last word for vocabulary preview. Performance. Performance. Performance.

01:00.240 --> 01:07.280
Performance. Your performance is how good or bad do you do your job? Right. So you can have good

01:07.280 --> 01:12.560
performance or bad performance. Just how well you do your job? Perfect. So now we're ready to

01:12.560 --> 01:17.600
listen to our dialogue for the first time and as always, it's going to be at a normal speed,

01:17.600 --> 01:22.160
but you don't have to worry about it. Because we'll come back and explain all the key language.

01:22.160 --> 01:27.840
Now we're going to listen as two managers discuss the performance of one employee.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.080
So Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative,

01:40.080 --> 01:46.560
Jason Huntley. Sure. What's up? Basically, I've got a few concerns about him and the bottom

01:46.800 --> 01:51.840
line is I don't think he's a good fit for our company. Okay. What makes you say that?

01:51.840 --> 01:56.720
I thought you were pleased with his overall performance. Didn't you just tell me last week how

01:56.720 --> 02:02.080
impressed you were with his attitude? Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unbelievable.

02:02.960 --> 02:07.520
Sometimes he's really productive, but then other times take last Tuesday, for instance,

02:07.520 --> 02:13.360
he was 45 minutes late for a morning meeting. Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason.

02:13.440 --> 02:18.160
But that's not the only thing. You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic.

02:18.160 --> 02:22.400
I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.

02:23.360 --> 02:29.280
Yeah, but come on, Jeff. As if you don't check Facebook at work, look, you hired this guy.

02:29.280 --> 02:34.000
We've invested a lot of time and money in his training. So now it's up to you to coach him.

02:34.000 --> 02:34.880
Make it work, Jeff.

02:34.880 --> 02:44.320
Make it very Jeff. You would say that wouldn't you. He is your cousin.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.520
Sure. Make me try your stupid useless cousin.

02:49.760 --> 02:56.400
So apparently Lauren hired her cousin. Yes. That's always a complicated situation working with family

02:56.400 --> 03:01.200
members. Yeah, it makes it really difficult for Jeff, doesn't it? Yeah, and apparently Jeff

03:01.200 --> 03:08.000
isn't very happy. Well, let's look at the language he used to tell us that he's unhappy about this.

03:09.760 --> 03:18.960
Language takeaway. Okay. The first word on language takeaway today, unreliable. Unreliable. Unreliable.

03:18.960 --> 03:26.000
Unreliable. So let's listen to some examples of unreliable. So then you can understand what it means.

03:26.640 --> 03:33.840
Example one. The trains here are so unreliable. They never arrive on time.

03:36.800 --> 03:45.280
Example two. Thomas is pretty unreliable. He never finishes his projects on time.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.480
Example three.

03:51.200 --> 03:57.600
You promised you would pick me up from work today. You're so unreliable.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.680
We can understand that if someone is unreliable, we can't trust them to do their job, right?

04:05.680 --> 04:12.240
Right. So you don't want to be unreliable. The opposite would be reliable. You can trust them.

04:12.240 --> 04:18.320
Okay. Our second word today, productive. Productive. Productive.

04:18.320 --> 04:24.800
When you're productive, it means that you accomplish your job, right? You do a lot of work in a short amount of time.

04:24.800 --> 04:32.960
Productive. You want to be a productive employee. Yes. Our third word work ethic. Work ethic. Work ethic.

04:32.960 --> 04:39.760
Work ethic. Work ethic. So a person's work ethic is that person's attitude towards work. Yes,

04:39.760 --> 04:45.360
if someone has a good work ethic, then they are always hardworking and they come to work early and they

04:45.360 --> 04:50.400
finish their jobs on time and they stay and do lots of overtime. So that's a good work ethic.

04:51.760 --> 05:00.560
Okay. Great. And our last word. Coach. Coach. Coach. When you coach an employee,

05:00.560 --> 05:07.680
you train them, right? Yeah. You help that employee out by showing him or her how to do certain tasks.

05:07.680 --> 05:14.240
Or how to do their job better. Right. So we've got some great language to describe work performance.

05:14.400 --> 05:19.440
Let's listen to our dialogue a second time. This time it'll be a little bit slower so you can

05:19.440 --> 05:31.920
understand these words and phrases a little bit more clearly. So Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you

05:31.920 --> 05:38.560
quickly about our new customer support representative Jason Huntley. Sure. What's up?

05:39.520 --> 05:46.960
Basically, I've got a few concerns about him and the bottom line is I don't think he's a

05:46.960 --> 05:54.240
good fit for our company. Okay. What makes you say that? I thought you were pleased with his

05:54.240 --> 06:00.480
overall performance. Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?

06:01.120 --> 06:09.520
Yeah. His attitude is great, but he's really unreliable. Sometimes he's really productive,

06:09.520 --> 06:17.360
but then other times take last Tuesday for instance. He was 45 minutes late for our morning meeting.

06:18.080 --> 06:24.880
Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason. But that's not the only thing. You know,

06:24.960 --> 06:31.920
he really doesn't have the best work ethic. I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook

06:31.920 --> 06:39.440
when he should be talking to clients. Yeah, but come on Jeff, as if you don't check Facebook

06:39.440 --> 06:46.560
at work. Look, you hired this guy. We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

06:47.200 --> 06:55.440
So now it's up to you to coach him. Make it work, Jeff. You would say that wouldn't you. He is

06:55.440 --> 07:00.240
your cousin. What a jerk. Make me hire your stupid useless cousin.

07:02.960 --> 07:08.160
All right. So if you noticed a lot of useful phrases have come up. So let's take a look at

07:08.160 --> 07:14.880
fluency builder fluency builder today. We have three phrases. That's right. Three phrases that

07:14.960 --> 07:21.760
will help us make our points better. The first one is bottom line. The bottom line. The bottom line.

07:22.320 --> 07:29.040
Let's listen to how this was used in the dialogue. And the bottom line is I don't think he's a good

07:29.040 --> 07:38.000
fit for our company. And the bottom line is I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

07:38.720 --> 07:44.160
So basically, it means like the most important point. The most important point. Perfect. The bottom

07:45.120 --> 07:53.280
line. Our second word. Overall. Overall. Overall. So this is the same as saying on the whole.

07:53.280 --> 08:00.320
Right. The big picture how you would say. Yeah, in general. In general. So his overall performance is good.

08:00.320 --> 08:06.240
It means in general. His performance is good. Perfect. And our last phrase is very interesting because

08:06.240 --> 08:13.120
we can mix it up a little bit. Yeah. Perfectly good. Perfectly good. Perfectly good.

08:13.920 --> 08:18.960
So this is an interesting phrase because you can describe different objects in this way. Yeah,

08:18.960 --> 08:25.680
a perfectly good reason. A perfectly good car. A perfectly good computer. So by the sounds of it,

08:25.680 --> 08:30.400
it's kind of like justifying. Yeah. It's saying there's no problem with that. There's no problem with it.

08:30.400 --> 08:37.440
Why we throw it away if it's a perfectly good computer. Exactly. Perfectly good. Okay. So now we

08:37.440 --> 08:43.520
can listen to our dialogue a third time at a normal speed. And now we're ready to understand everything.

08:52.960 --> 08:59.280
So Lauren, I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative Jason Hundley.

08:59.280 --> 09:05.200
Sure. What's up? Basically, I've got a few concerns about him. And the bottom line is,

09:05.280 --> 09:10.400
I don't think he's a good fit for our company. Okay. What makes you say that? I thought you

09:10.400 --> 09:15.360
were pleased with his overall performance. Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were

09:15.360 --> 09:21.840
with his attitude? Yeah, his attitude is great, but he's really unreliable. Sometimes he's really

09:21.840 --> 09:27.760
productive, but then other times take last Tuesday, for instance, he was 45 minutes late for a

09:27.760 --> 09:32.640
morning meeting. Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason. But that's not the only thing.

09:32.640 --> 09:38.720
You know, he really doesn't have the best work ethic. I'm constantly catching him on MSN and

09:38.720 --> 09:44.800
Facebook when he should be talking to clients. Yeah, but come on, Jeff. As if you don't check Facebook

09:44.800 --> 09:50.160
at work, look, you hired this guy. We've invested a lot of time and money in his training.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.880
So now it's up to you to coach him. Make it work, Jeff.

09:52.880 --> 10:14.320
