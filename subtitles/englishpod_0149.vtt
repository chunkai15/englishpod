00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
Hello everyone and welcome back to English Pod, my name is Marko, and my name is Katherine,

00:08.720 --> 00:14.320
so Marko today we're talking about rent and housing. Right, we're actually going to be moving,

00:14.320 --> 00:18.880
we're going to be going to a new apartment or a new house, and so we're going to look at all the

00:18.880 --> 00:24.320
words related to this because sometimes it can be a real hassle, right? It can be really difficult.

00:24.320 --> 00:28.080
Absolutely, but you love moving, right? You are timing how much you love moving your stuff,

00:28.880 --> 00:33.920
negotiating a new league. Well, like the negotiation of the lease, but not the moving aspect.

00:33.920 --> 00:39.040
I don't think anyone likes. Actually, I do like it at times because then you can just throw away

00:39.040 --> 00:43.760
so many things that you have no need for and you wouldn't throw away unless you move.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.760
So let's go check out today's dialogue to find out what happens to the characters.

00:47.760 --> 01:03.200
Okay, that's fine, bye. What happened? That's it. I leases up. I have to move. What? Why? Can't you renew it?

01:03.920 --> 01:08.480
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.440
Well, I can help you pack. We should start looking for a new place for you, ASAP.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.200
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.000
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here. I'm going to have to put most of my

01:24.000 --> 01:28.640
stuff in storage for a while. Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.920
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

01:40.480 --> 01:43.120
Sure.

01:43.920 --> 01:49.680
All right, we're back. So, well, it's not much of a big deal. I guess if you have your parents

01:49.680 --> 01:55.200
nearby, you can just move back in with your parents. Easier said than that. True. True. We'll get to that

01:55.200 --> 01:59.360
in a little bit, but let's take a look at the words that are used today in language takeaway.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.320
Language takeaway. All right, so this first one is an important one because generally, when you're

02:06.320 --> 02:12.000
looking for a house or an apartment, there are two things you can do. You can buy a house or you can

02:12.560 --> 02:20.000
lease a house or apartment. So, lease here, Marco. It's basically to rent, right? It's a contract where

02:20.000 --> 02:27.520
you agree to pay a monthly or a quarterly fee for using that house or apartment. So, do you own

02:27.520 --> 02:33.520
your apartment or do you lease it? No, I'll mine, I lease. Yeah, I'm not a home owner yet. Right. So,

02:33.520 --> 02:38.240
owning a home is a lot more expensive at one kind of period where you have to just pay in and you

02:38.240 --> 02:43.680
maybe a mortgage, but leasing is just a monthly fee, like you said. So, in this case, they had to

02:43.680 --> 02:49.520
leave because their lease was expired. Exactly. So, you can, at the end of a lease, do one of

02:49.520 --> 02:55.040
two things. You can stop and you can find a new apartment or you can renew your lease. All right,

02:55.040 --> 03:00.480
and that's our next word to renew your lease basically means to, to continue, to continue.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.480
And this is actually a good word because it can be used with a con any contract because really

03:04.480 --> 03:11.600
a lease is a kind of contract. And so, I can say, I renewed my job contract or maybe a magazine

03:11.600 --> 03:16.320
subscription. Yeah. You renewed your magazine subscription. It's a, it's a way of saying that you've

03:16.320 --> 03:22.640
committed to paying for the next six months or one year. Okay. Well, and after that, as we said,

03:22.640 --> 03:30.880
the person decided to move in with the parents. So, move in. Moving, what we can say, he moved

03:30.960 --> 03:36.160
his car. He put it in a different place, but to move in is actually to, to change houses or

03:36.160 --> 03:41.040
the change apartments. And you're, you're literally moving your things and you're moving your

03:41.040 --> 03:45.680
clothes and you're moving into a new home. So, you're living in a new place. So, in this case,

03:45.680 --> 03:53.120
this person is going to live with the parents move in. All right. And our next word is when you

03:53.120 --> 03:59.360
have to move, you have to pack. Okay. So, you can pack a lot of things. In this case, you're

03:59.360 --> 04:04.640
packing a box with all of your bowlongings, your books and your pillows and all that,

04:04.640 --> 04:10.080
but you can also pack a suitcase or you can pack luggage. So, packing is putting things into

04:10.080 --> 04:14.400
something so that you can move them. So, you can carry them or take them somewhere. Exactly. So,

04:14.400 --> 04:18.480
in this case, you have to pack your things, put them in boxes to take them to your new home.

04:19.200 --> 04:24.800
And our last word is an acronym when you said ASAP. All right. SNAP SNAP, come on, ASAP, Marco.

04:24.800 --> 04:31.280
ASAP. Describe this for us quickly. All right. So, ASAP is an acronym for as soon as possible.

04:31.280 --> 04:37.040
Okay. See you often. See this in the office on envelopes or emails. So, please respond

04:37.040 --> 04:43.600
ASAP ASAP. This means, please respond right away. As soon as you can, as soon as possible.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.800
All right. So, five great word is that we've just taken a look at. Let's listen to our dialogue again.

04:48.800 --> 04:55.920
And we'll be right back. Okay. That's fine. Bye.

04:56.960 --> 05:03.200
What happened? That's it. I leases up. I have to move. What? Why? Can't you renew it?

05:03.840 --> 05:08.480
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.440
Well, I can help you pack. We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.

05:14.320 --> 05:19.200
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.920
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here. I'm going to have to put most of my

05:23.920 --> 05:28.640
stuff in storage for a while. Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.840
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

05:33.920 --> 05:36.560
Uh, sure.

05:41.360 --> 05:45.520
All right. We're back and we have a couple of different phrases for you. So let's look at those

05:45.520 --> 05:51.840
now in fluency builder. Fluency builder. Our first one's a little bit unusual. We heard the phrase

05:51.840 --> 05:58.800
my lease is up. So, Mark, let's talk about this phrase to be up. All right. So, if something is up

05:58.880 --> 06:04.560
as in this case, the lease, it means it's expired. It's finished, right? So, it's over.

06:05.120 --> 06:10.240
You can also say our time is up. Right. If we have a meeting. So, that's all the time I have.

06:10.240 --> 06:15.680
Time to go away. Time is up. Very good. So, it's always related to time or maybe a contract

06:15.680 --> 06:21.920
is in this case. Are your lease is up? So, it means over or finished. All right. So, moving on to our

06:21.920 --> 06:27.120
second phrase. To make way for, all right. So, this is a great one. This often makes me think of

06:27.600 --> 06:32.080
kings and queens in the old days as they make way for the king. So, you have to get out of the way.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.000
Yeah, get out of the way or to clear some space for them to move because there's too much

06:36.000 --> 06:40.400
stuff in the way. And so, in this case, the owner of the apartment with the guy that was living in

06:40.400 --> 06:45.200
is trying to make some space or make way for a parking lot. Right. So, he's basically going to

06:45.200 --> 06:51.040
sell the building or house and build a parking lot instead. So, they are making way for the new parking

06:51.040 --> 06:54.720
lot. They're clearing space. And this is actually really sad because my childhood home,

06:55.120 --> 07:04.240
they destroyed to make way for a larger ugly building house. It happens all the time. Now, they're

07:04.240 --> 07:10.800
making way for malls and the big buildings and all the little houses are destroyed. And,

07:10.800 --> 07:18.160
well, moving on to our last phrase, the person asked the friend if he would mind looking after

07:18.160 --> 07:22.560
the pet snake and torrentula. I would mind. You don't like snakes or torrentula.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.840
I don't mind having a dog that I don't live with them. So, would you mind how this is a nice way

07:27.840 --> 07:34.240
to start a sentence if you want to ask for a favor, right? Exactly. So, here's an alternative.

07:34.240 --> 07:41.120
Hey, Marco. Can you do this for me? I could, maybe. I could say, Marco, would you mind doing this for

07:41.120 --> 07:46.080
me? It sounds it's more polite. It is more polite and it's a little bit gentler. Yeah.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.920
So, it's nice. It's a nice way of asking someone for a favor. Exactly. And that's why this is funny

07:51.920 --> 07:57.040
because the favor is not like, would you mind watching my kitty? The favor is, would you mind

07:57.040 --> 08:04.640
watching my poison as pets? Right. All right. So, would you mind it? But, in the end, the person agreed.

08:04.640 --> 08:10.640
So, it works, right? It does work. So, would you mind? So, listeners, would you mind listening

08:10.640 --> 08:15.120
to today's dialogue one more time at its normal speed before we come back to you and talk more

08:15.120 --> 08:28.720
about renting an apartment? Okay, that's fine. Bye. What happened? That's it. I least

08:28.720 --> 08:35.440
is up. I have to move. What? Why? Can't you renew it? The owner apparently is selling this

08:35.440 --> 08:40.960
place to make way for the construction of a parking lot. Well, I can help you pack. We should

08:40.960 --> 08:46.720
start looking for a new place for you, ASAP. I think I might move in with my parents for a couple

08:46.720 --> 08:51.840
of months until I can find something. You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here.

08:52.240 --> 08:57.040
I'm going to have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while. Well, let me know if there's

08:57.040 --> 09:02.720
anything I can do to help out. Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake

09:02.800 --> 09:19.360
for a couple of weeks? Sure. All right. So, moving in. Now, you have different

09:19.360 --> 09:24.240
stages in your life, right? When you move out, for example, you move out of your parents home

09:24.240 --> 09:30.000
and you live on your own and then maybe, like in this case, you would move back in with your

09:30.000 --> 09:35.280
parents. How do you see that happening? I see it very often. My brother just moved back in with my

09:35.280 --> 09:40.400
parents. Really? Yeah, I think that it depends on the person. Honestly, I mean, especially because

09:40.400 --> 09:44.240
the economy has really been suffering for the last year. A lot of people are doing this because,

09:44.240 --> 09:48.080
you know, in a lot of cities in America, you can spend a thousand to two thousand dollars

09:48.080 --> 09:53.200
a month for an apartment to rent. And that's a small apartment or a shared apartment. And so,

09:53.920 --> 09:59.040
I understand this is a really, well, it's a better option now than it was before because everyone

09:59.120 --> 10:03.600
wants independence, but sometimes you just can't afford it. It's actually, and it's a cultural

10:03.600 --> 10:08.640
thing because some people move out of their parents home, maybe for college. It's very common

10:08.640 --> 10:14.640
in the U.S. for to study in another city or another state, right? But then maybe coming back home

10:14.640 --> 10:18.640
and moving in with your parents or in other cultures, maybe they don't move out at all,

10:18.640 --> 10:23.760
maybe they only move out once they're married. Exactly. So, a lot of people in China, I think

10:23.760 --> 10:29.680
in Shanghai, specifically, don't move out until, don't move out of their parents home

10:29.680 --> 10:33.680
until they're going to get married. Right, but, well, it does make sense. And in many

10:33.680 --> 10:38.560
big metropolis because, as you say, rent is expensive, living on your own is expensive. And,

10:38.560 --> 10:42.800
well, you don't have anyone to share those costs with, like, gas, water, electricity,

10:42.800 --> 10:47.040
even food, right? It's certainly more people. And not to mention, a little bit scary,

10:47.040 --> 10:51.360
living on your own for the first time. It is a little bit scary. What about having somebody

10:51.360 --> 10:55.600
move in with you, maybe a roommate or girlfriend boyfriend? Ooh, that's always the big stop

10:55.600 --> 11:00.000
the big commitment. The big commitment and your in a relationship and you ask your partner to

11:00.000 --> 11:06.080
move in with you. So, yeah, the step before marriage, I guess. There's nothing before that,

11:06.080 --> 11:11.200
nothing before marriage. No. That's pretty much it. You tell me, I don't know. All right,

11:11.200 --> 11:16.000
that's all the time we have for today. But be sure to come to our website, englishpod.com.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.960

11:21.040 --> 11:25.680

11:25.680 --> 11:30.000
step, before marriage, please let us know because we're in the dark on this one. So, until next time.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
All right, bye, bye.
