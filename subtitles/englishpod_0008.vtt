00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Hello English learners and welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:06.320 --> 00:07.320
And I'm Erica.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.320
How are you, Erica?

00:08.320 --> 00:10.440
Marco, I'm doing really well today.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.440
You're excited.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.440
Uh-huh.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.440
We've got a great lesson for everyone.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.320
Yes, we have a really common situation where we're going to use real English, right?

00:17.320 --> 00:18.320
Yep.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.040
Every day English, English that people really use.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.720
And that's what we want you to learn.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.720
What are we talking about today specifically?

00:24.720 --> 00:29.920
Today we have a really common situation that is a little bit embarrassing.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.840
All right, an embarrassing situation.

00:32.840 --> 00:37.640
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and it's going to be kind of fast.

00:37.640 --> 00:43.560
Yeah, but don't worry if you don't understand everything because after 10 minutes you'll

00:43.560 --> 00:45.560
understand everything.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.560
Perfect.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.560
All right, let's listen.

00:49.560 --> 00:58.200
Nick, how's it going?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.400
Oh, hey.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.000
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.520
Do you live around here?

01:03.520 --> 01:06.280
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.520
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.320
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.560
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.360
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.160
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.680
Sure, you still have my contact details, right?

01:23.680 --> 01:24.920
You know what?

01:24.920 --> 01:28.680
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.000
Can you remind me?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Sure.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.160
My name is Anna Ferris.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.160
Don't worry about it.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.680
It happens to me all the time.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.800
I'm terrible with names too.

01:36.800 --> 01:44.880
Wow, Nick forgot her name.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.000
Yeah, that's happened to me a couple of times.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.920
And I'm going to tell you about it a little bit later.

01:48.920 --> 01:49.920
Okay.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.840
All right, well, let's start with our three language takeaways.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.640
Language takeaway.

01:57.640 --> 02:02.480
So our first word on our language takeaway is in a bit of a hurry.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.360
In a bit of a hurry.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.040
In a bit of a hurry.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.440
In a bit of a hurry.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.280
So Nick was in a hurry.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.760
Yeah, that's right.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.360
This is a great phrase.

02:12.360 --> 02:18.400
So let's listen to three examples of how you can use this phrase.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.080
Example one.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
Can you drive faster?

02:23.080 --> 02:27.840
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.840
Example two.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.840
I can't talk right now.

02:33.840 --> 02:40.480
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

02:41.480 --> 02:47.480
I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'll check these files later.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.480
Okay.

02:48.480 --> 02:53.360
So it's clear now, basically, it means that you don't have time.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.760
You're moving really quickly.

02:54.760 --> 02:55.760
Okay.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.760
Perfect.

02:56.760 --> 03:01.840
Now let's look at our second language takeaway word and its contact details.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.600
Contact details.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
Contact details.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.600
Contact details.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.960
So what are your contact details?

03:07.960 --> 03:12.960
Basically, this is the information you can find on your business card.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
All right.

03:13.960 --> 03:19.720
So we have our name, our telephone number, your email address, perhaps your mobile phone

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
number.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.640
So all the useful information so people can get in touch with you.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
Yep.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.160
So people can phone you or email you.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.160
Okay.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.160
So contact details.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.160
Great.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.160
Okay.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.200
So our third word is slipped my mind.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.720
Slip my mind.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.200
Slip my mind.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.560
Slip my mind.

03:37.560 --> 03:38.960
So this is a funny phrase.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.360
It's kind of strange, right?

03:40.360 --> 03:41.360
Yes.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.360
Slip my mind.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.360
It sounds very weird.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.360
Exactly.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.360
Okay.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.760
So now we're going to listen to two examples of this phrase.

03:49.760 --> 03:53.560
Try and see if you can figure out what it means.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.560
Example one.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.600
I'm sorry I forgot to respond to your email.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.680
Just slip my mind.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.680
Example two.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.400
You know what day it is today.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.280
Oh, it's your birthday.

04:11.280 --> 04:16.280
It completely slipped my mind.

04:16.280 --> 04:17.280
Ah.

04:17.280 --> 04:20.400
So slipped my mind is like, I forgot.

04:20.400 --> 04:21.400
You forgot something.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.400
Uh-huh.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.400
So accidentally.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.400
Right.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.400
Okay.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.400
Great.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.800
Now it's time for putting it together.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.200
Putting it together.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.200
All right.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.680
Erica, why don't you tell our listeners what putting it together is?

04:34.680 --> 04:38.880
Well, putting it together helps you put language together.

04:38.880 --> 04:43.880
It helps you be more fluent by knowing how words fit together.

04:43.880 --> 04:44.880
Great.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.480
So let's look at our first phrase today and it's around here.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.080
Around here.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.280
Around here.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.880
Around here.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.880
So this is like close by.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.880
Close by.

04:55.880 --> 04:56.880
Right.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.880
I can say, for example, is there a bank around here?

04:59.880 --> 05:00.880
Yeah.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.080
So that's, is there a bank close to here?

05:03.080 --> 05:04.080
Exactly.

05:04.080 --> 05:09.400
So this phrase around here, we can change it a little bit and it means something a little

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
bit different.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.400
Right.

05:11.400 --> 05:15.560
I could say, Marco, there's a great restaurant right around the corner.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.560
Right.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.000
And that would mean there is a great restaurant on the other street.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Yep.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Around the corner.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Yep.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Great.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Or we have another example.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.880
We can say around there.

05:26.880 --> 05:27.880
Around there.

05:27.880 --> 05:28.880
Right.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.320
So for example, I can say Los Angeles is a great city.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.280
I used to live around there.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.720
So you used to live near Los Angeles.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.720
Exactly.

05:37.720 --> 05:38.720
All right.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.960
It's a really good phrase and it's really common.

05:40.960 --> 05:41.960
Yeah.

05:41.960 --> 05:46.640
Now our next phrase and putting it together is Terrible with.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.640
Terrible with.

05:47.640 --> 05:48.960
Terrible with.

05:48.960 --> 05:49.960
Terrible with.

05:49.960 --> 05:56.560
So we have a couple of examples that will show you how this phrase works.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.680
Example 1.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.480
You're terrible with numbers.

06:02.480 --> 06:08.920
You can't even remember your own telephone number.

06:08.920 --> 06:12.480
Example 2.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.080
I'm terrible with directions.

06:14.080 --> 06:18.840
I'm always getting lost.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.080
Example 3.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.680
I'm terrible with faces.

06:23.680 --> 06:29.400
I can never remember what people look like.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.160
Wow, I understand that.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.520
I'm also terrible with numbers.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.920
I can barely add 2 plus 2.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.880
Well, yeah, I guess not everyone is a numbers person.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.640
I'm terrible with faces.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.320
I sometimes forget what people look like.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.320
Really?

06:45.320 --> 06:45.840
Uh-oh.

06:45.840 --> 06:50.400
So I think it's time now for us to listen to our dialogue a second time.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.720
OK, this time the dialogue will be a little bit slower.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.240
Right.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.640
So try and listen for some of the words we've just talked about.

07:00.400 --> 07:04.160
Nick, how's it going?

07:04.160 --> 07:05.960
Oh, hey.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.440
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

07:08.440 --> 07:10.520
Do you live around here?

07:10.520 --> 07:14.320
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.880
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

07:17.880 --> 07:22.400
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.240
Yeah, yeah.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.640
It was really interesting.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.360
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.400
But here's my card.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.920
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.920
Sure.

07:36.920 --> 07:41.800
You still have my contact details, right?

07:41.800 --> 07:43.200
You know what?

07:43.200 --> 07:48.440
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.920
Can you remind me?

07:49.920 --> 07:51.440
Sure.

07:51.440 --> 07:54.680
My name is Ana Ferris.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.280
Don't worry about it.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.120
It happens to me all the time.

07:59.120 --> 08:05.280
I'm terrible with names, too.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.520
So it's more clear now.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.160
You can understand a lot better, right?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.320
Yeah, that's true.

08:09.320 --> 08:09.840
Great.

08:09.840 --> 08:14.440
So now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.960
Fluency Builder.

08:15.960 --> 08:20.280
So with Fluency Builder, we take some very simple phrases

08:20.280 --> 08:26.360
and show you how you can be more fluent or how you can sound more native.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.040
Yeah.

08:27.040 --> 08:27.720
Great.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.960
In the beginning of the dialogue, Ana said,

08:30.960 --> 08:32.440
Nick, how's it going?

08:32.440 --> 08:33.840
Yeah, this is a great phrase.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.120
It sounds really, really natural.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.800
You know, sometimes I hear students say,

08:38.800 --> 08:40.200
how are you?

08:40.200 --> 08:41.760
Or how are you doing?

08:41.760 --> 08:46.760
Those are two great phrases, but this one sounds really, really natural.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.120
It just sounds more casual.

08:49.120 --> 08:53.640
Yeah, let's listen again to that phrase from the dialogue.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.560
How's it going?

08:56.560 --> 08:59.000
How's it going?

08:59.000 --> 08:59.520
Great.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.720
So next time that you find a friend on the street,

09:01.720 --> 09:03.720
you can just say, hey, how's it going?

09:03.720 --> 09:04.720
Yeah.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.600
So Marco, have you ever forgotten someone's name?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.320
Yeah, it's happened to me a couple of times.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.560
And actually, the most embarrassing situation

09:13.560 --> 09:15.600
was that I forgot a family member's name.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.600
No, a family member's name.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.200
We had a family reunion, and there

09:20.200 --> 09:23.000
were a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins

09:23.000 --> 09:24.400
that I hadn't seen in a while.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.040
And I just forgot one of my uncles' names.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.440
And I was, oh, that's pretty embarrassing.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.080
So what did you do?

09:31.080 --> 09:33.600
Well, I had to ask one of my other cousins,

09:33.600 --> 09:34.760
I'm like, hey, who is that guy?

09:34.760 --> 09:36.240
He's like, oh, that's Uncle John.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.400
I'm like, oh, man, I totally forgot.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.200
Yeah, so it was really embarrassing

09:40.200 --> 09:41.800
because I didn't know what to call him.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.960
So I just called him Uncle, because I didn't know his name.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.760
Hi, Uncle.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.160
Yeah.

09:47.160 --> 09:47.760
Oh, yeah.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.760
So when that happens to me, when I'm in a business setting,

09:51.800 --> 09:56.320
sometimes what I do is I ask for someone's card.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.480
Yeah, that's the good technique.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.400
Yeah, or sometimes I might ask them to write down their email.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.280
Because usually their full name is spelled out

10:03.280 --> 10:04.120
in their email address.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.560
So that's my trick when I've forgotten someone's name.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.400
That's a good trick.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.560
And I guess a lot of our listeners can take your advice on that.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.280
OK, so I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.440
One more time, this time at Natural Speed.

10:21.760 --> 10:27.960
Nick, how's it going?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.280
Oh, hey.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.920
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

10:31.920 --> 10:33.400
Do you live around here?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.160
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.520
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.240
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.440
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.280
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.240
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.520
Sure, you still have my contact details, right?

10:53.520 --> 10:54.760
You know what?

10:54.760 --> 10:58.560
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.760
Can you remind me?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.920
Sure, my name is Anna Ferris.

11:01.920 --> 11:02.720
Don't worry about it.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.680
It happens to me all the time.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.000
I'm terrible with names, too.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.280
Well, I hope that you've all enjoyed our lesson for today.

11:13.280 --> 11:18.080
And remember to check out our website at EnglishPod.com

11:18.080 --> 11:21.120
where you can find a lot of other resources

11:21.120 --> 11:23.360
and you can leave all your questions and comments.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.160
Yeah, Marco and I are always on this site,

11:25.160 --> 11:27.520
so we're happy to answer all of your questions.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.120
Exactly.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.520
So now it's time for us to say goodbye.
