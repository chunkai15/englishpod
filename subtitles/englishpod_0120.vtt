00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marko.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
And my name is Erica.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Today we're bringing you another one of our sports lessons and this time we're going to go to a boxing match.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
That's right, so we're going to be learning languages that you can use if you're talking about boxing, but not only boxing, right?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Right, we can also use this language for describing a fight or somebody that's fighting.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
Okay, so not that we're asking our listeners to get into fights, but if ever you see a fight, at least now you'll have the language to talk about it.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Exactly, so let's listen to a dialogue for the first time.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
It might sound familiar.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
We have the legendary Rocky Balboa at EnglishPod fighting for the heavyweight championships.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
So let's see what happens.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Welcome back boxing fans, my name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man with the iron jaw, Bob Copeland.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Thank you, Rick.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
We're coming to you live from Las Vegas.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
We're in the beautiful MGM Grand Hotel in Castino.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
We're the world heavyweight championship is about to get underway.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
That's right, Bob.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
We're about to witness the legendary Italian style in himself, Rocky Balboa.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Square Off against his lifetime rival, Apollo Creed.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
This will be a gruesome match for sure.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Both fighters are in the ring, and we are about to begin.

01:28.000 --> 01:37.000
In Bukora, weighing in at 220 pounds, the former heavyweight champion of the world,

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
the master of disaster, the one and only Apollo Creed.

01:46.000 --> 01:56.000
In the red corner, weighing in 280 pounds, and with a record of 47 wins and 37 knockouts,

01:56.000 --> 02:06.000
the undefeated, undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, the Italian style Rocky Balboa.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
There's the bell, and his fight is underway.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Apollo quickly attacks Rocky with quick, strong jabs.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Rocky Dodge is successfully in counterattacks with a strong right hook.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Apollo has come.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Rocky landed a strong blow to his right eyebrow and cut him.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
This is his chance.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Rocky quickly throws a left.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Right?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Another left.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Apollo is getting grounded.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Apollo recovers with a powerful handmaker and catches Rocky off guard.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
He's down.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
The rep starts the count.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
One.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Two.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Three.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
One.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Wow, sounds like a great fight.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Amazing fight end.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I don't know who's going to win.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Rocky apparently got knocked down.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
What do you think will happen?

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Well, if I know anything about Rocky Balboa, he will not stay knocked down the long.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
All right.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
So let's take a look at some of the language we saw in this dialogue in language takeaway.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Language takeaway.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Well, Rickfield said that we have a very gruesome match tonight.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
A gruesome match.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
gruesome.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
All right.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
So if something is gruesome.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It's really, it's bad.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It's terrible.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
It's bloody.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Bloody.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Terrible.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Very hard.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Like a gruesome fight would be a very bloody fight.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Or a gruesome film.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Very good.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
So gruesome.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Now they mentioned that both fighters are in the ring.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Both fighters are in the ring.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
The ring.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Okay.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
So the ring is the physical space where they fight.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
But isn't it square?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
It is square.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
It does not really circular.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
But it's called a boxing ring.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm not really sure why.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
Well, maybe one of our listeners knows and can tell us about that because I am not an expert

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
on boxing.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
But what I do know is our next words.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
They were describing Rocky Balbo's career.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
And they said he had 37 knockouts.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Okay.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
A knockout.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
A knockout.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
In this sense, knockout is a noun.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
A knockout is when the fighter hits the other fighter.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And he falls to the ground.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And he can't get up in 10 seconds.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Because he's tired.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
He's dizzy.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
He's hurt.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
So that's a knockout.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Okay.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
So this is a technical boxing word.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
It's the action of falling to the ground and not getting up.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Right.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
But there's also a verb to knock out.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Or to knock someone out.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
So exactly.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So when you say, I knock this guy out.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
It means I hit him so hard that he fell to the floor.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
And maybe he was unconscious for a while.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
So he fell asleep basically.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Almost.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
So it's very similar.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
The noun form to the verb form.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Like basically, if you knock someone out, you get a knockout.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Okay.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
So to knock someone out, a knockout.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
All right.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
Now for our next word, we saw as Apollo quickly began to jab Rocky Balboa.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
So the noun, a jab.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
So a jab.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Quick, jabs.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
So a jab is a kind of punch, right?

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
It's a fast, short, but not very strong punch.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Okay.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
So a technical boxing word, a jab.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
This can also be a verb, right?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Right.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
So to jab.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
To jab.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Now Apollo was throwing jabs and Rocky began to dodge.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
All right.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
That's our next word.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
To dodge.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Dodge.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
D-O-D-G-E-2 dodge.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
All right.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
So if you dodge, you're trying to avoid getting hit.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Right.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
So you move your body so that you're not hit.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Exactly.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Now we can also use it in different ways.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Not only do you dodge when somebody is trying to punch you, you can also, for example, dodge a bullet.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Right.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
So when you dodge a bullet, you avoid some bad situation or some bad event.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Right.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
So we have many examples of dodge used in other contexts.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
So why don't we listen to some examples?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Example one.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
See that guy dodging through the traffic.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
He's going to get hit by a car if he's not careful.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Example two.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Well, the storm turned south.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
So it looks like we managed to dodge a bullet.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Example three.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Look, you're the one who is in charge of sales and the numbers are down.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
It's your problem.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So stop trying to dodge your responsibilities.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
You know, that word reminds me of another sport dodge ball.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Oh, dodge ball.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Exactly.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Same principle.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, but that's an entirely different lesson.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
I think we need to focus here on the boxing vocabulary.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
So the announcers said that Apollo is getting pounded to get pounded.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
To get pounded.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
Now if someone is getting pounded, they're getting hit really hard and a lot.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
So to get pounded.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Get pounded.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And now we have one more word.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
And it's also another boxing term called a haymaker.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
A powerful haymaker.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Okay, so Apollo received a powerful haymaker.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Now this word is actually new to me.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
So Marko, what does it mean?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Basically, it's a very strong, very wild punch.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Okay, so you don't have really good form.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Your body is kind of moving all over the place.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Right.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
So you don't have much balance.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
So you just throw your entire body and your fist at someone to hit them as hard as you can.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
That's a haymaker.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
All right.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
A technical boxing word here for you guys.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
But now we've got some interesting phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Fluency Builder.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
All right.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
So on Fluency Builder today, we're going to take a look at some of these phrases and we have four of them for you today.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
So let's get started with the first one.

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
Well, the announcer said that the boxing match was about to get underway.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Okay, to get underway.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
To get underway.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
So again, this is another way of saying about to begin.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Right.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
All right. So we're about to get underway with this new project.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Or the meetings just about to get underway.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So make sure everyone's here.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Very good.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So the match was about to get underway.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
And the sports announcer said that Rocky Balboa is going to square off against his lifetime rival.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
So we're going to look at this phrase to square off against someone.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
All right.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
I'm going to square off against Jim.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
All right.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So we're about to have a one to one competition.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
So this is like a sports word.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
But it's also really commonly used in a lot of different context.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
So why don't we hear a few more examples of how we can use this phrase to square off.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Example one.

08:55.000 --> 09:10.000
The two countries are moving their armies close to the borders as they prepare to square off in a board dispute.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Two.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
It's named Brazil Square in the final game this afternoon.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Example three.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Lisa and Daniel squared off against each other the marketing meeting today.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
They were both pretty angry.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
All right.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
So great examples.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
And I think we can use it now.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Not only in boxing, but in other situations.

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
Now Bob said that Rocky landed a strong blow to land a strong blow.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
All right.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
So land a strong blow.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Now let's break this down.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
So a blow.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
A blow is a punch or a hit.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And when you land a strong blow, what happens?

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
You basically successfully hit your opponent with a punch or hit.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
So you hit them.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
So you're you're fist meets their body.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yes.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
So your fist landed on their body.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
So I could also change this a little bit.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
I could say I landed a punch right or in boxing terms.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
He landed a strong left jab.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Okay.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
So to land a blow, the announcer described it as rock through a left to throw a left.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
So he said he threw a left and a right.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Now again, we'll take this one apart.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
So a left.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
What are we talking about?

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Basically a left punch, but we can omit punch.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Okay.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
So it's a punch with your left hand.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
But the verb is throw.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
You throw a left punch.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
So basically you punch somebody with your left.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
So it's just another way of saying to punch someone.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
So punch someone, right?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
So Bob started to throw some punches at the other guy.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
All right.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Or look over there.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
That guy's throwing punches.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
All right.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
So to throw a left to throw a punch.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Now again, you can use this in a lot of different ways with a lot of different types of punches.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
So you could say to throw a jab.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Okay.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Or throw an uppercut.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Or throw a hook.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Okay.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
So now that we've seen all these phrases, why don't we listen to the dialogue for the very last time?

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
And we'll come back in a little bit.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Welcome back, boxing fans.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
My name is Rick Fields, and here with me is the man with the iron jaw.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Bob Copeland.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Thank you, Rick.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
We're coming to you live from Las Vegas.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
We're in the beautiful MGM, Brand Hotel in Casino.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
We're the world heavyweight championship.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
It's about to get underway.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
That's right, Bob.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
We're about to witness the legendary Italian style in himself, Rocky Balboa.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Square Off against his lifetime rival, Apollo Creed.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
This will be a gruesome match for sure.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Both fighters are in the ring.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
And we are about to begin.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
In the blue corner.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Winging at 220 pounds.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
The former heavyweight champion of the world.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
The master of disaster.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
The one.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
And only Apollo Creed.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
In the red corner.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Winging to 118 pounds.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
And with a record of 47 wins and 37 knockouts.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
The undefeated, undisputed, heavyweight champion of the world.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
The Italian style.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Rocky Balboa.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
There's the bell.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And this fight is underway.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Apollo quickly attacks Rocky with quick strong jabs.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Rocky dodges successfully.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
The counter attacks with a strong right hook.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Apollo is cut.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
Rocky landed a strong blow to his right eyebrow and cut him.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
This is his chance.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Rocky quickly throws a left.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Right.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Another left.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Apollo is getting pounded.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Apollo recovers with a powerful handmaker.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And catches Rocky off guard.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
He's down.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
The rep starts the count.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
One.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Two.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Three.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
One.

13:18.000 --> 13:27.000
So as I mentioned, Marco, I'm not really that much of a fan or that knowledgeable about boxing.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
And actually, this is becoming a theme in these sports lessons, isn't it?

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, boxing is a very popular sport in North America.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I'm not really that big of a fan.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
But I have seen a couple of matches.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
And it's very interesting because as we saw in our dialogue,

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
big fights take place in Las Vegas at some big hotel.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Right.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
But you said it's super popular and everyone wants to watch these matches.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And obviously everyone can't go to Las Vegas.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
So what's the common way for most people to watch these boxing matches?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Right.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
So in the United States, there's something very popular called paper view.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
And I'm sure in your countries, you have something similar.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Basically, paper view, you can buy the fight.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
So you can have access to it and watch it on your TV.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
But you only pay one time to watch like maybe two hours, right?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Right.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
So let's say you're at your house.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
It's six o'clock and the fight at the fight begins at eight.

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
So you can call your TV cable company or maybe use on the internet with a credit card.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
And they activate it on your TV so you can watch the fight.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
And when it's over, well, you finished watching it.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Now, it's pretty expensive, isn't it?

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
Yeah, paper view can be very expensive depending on what event it is.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
Because sometimes it's boxing matches, concerts or special events.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
So it can maybe cost, I don't know, 60, 80, maybe a hundred dollars.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
So it's very popular for one house to buy the paper view.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
And then many friends come over and everyone chips in with five or ten dollars and everyone watches it on one TV.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
All right.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
The paper view boxing party, a common way to watch the sport in America.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Exactly.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Now, what do you guys visit our website and tell us about boxing?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Do you guys like it? Do you know anything about it?

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Are you guys maybe even boxers yourself?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Or former boxers.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
All right.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
