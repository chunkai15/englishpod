00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marko and I'm Erica and we're bringing you the third part of our

00:08.000 --> 00:17.000
Suspense series of new guy in town. That's right. What's gonna happen today? Well, I don't know. There's still so many things that could happen. This guy is kind of weird, right?

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Is he a vampire? Like what's going on?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Yeah, and I would like to think all of our listeners for contributing and

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
sending out their ideas of what they think happens in this third part. Yeah, I especially like the story about the rabbits.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah, the rabbit. That was a good one. Yeah.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
As promised, we took the idea of one of our listeners and created the dialogue around it.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Yes. And this time, it was a contribution of Babar Dewan.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah, he gave us a great idea from the dialogue.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Exactly. He gave us a really good idea, so thank you Babar and this one is for you.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
In this dialogue, we're going to be looking at some hospitality vocabulary.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Yeah, some phrases you can use when you welcome someone to your house.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
All right. Well, we've got some language to preview. So let's turn now to vocabulary preview.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Very vocabulary preview.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
On vocabulary preview, we have the word appetites.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Appetites. Appetites.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
So, Erica, tell us about appetites.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
When you have an appetite, you, your, your hungry or you have a desire to eat food, right?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
All right. So you can have a big appetite, a small appetite.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Mm-hmm. Really hungry, a little bit hungry. Okay.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Let's look at our next word. Poison. Poison. Poison. Poison. Poison.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
So poison could be a noun or a verb. Exactly.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
So when you poison someone, you put something in their food or maybe in their drink that makes them really sick,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
and maybe even makes them die. Okay. So two poison somebody.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
Yep. And the noun is actually the thing that you put inside the food or drink.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
So usually poison is some sort of chemical substance.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yes.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Snakes, for example, have poison.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah, in their teeth, right? So if you get bitten by a snake, you'll get poisoned.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
You'll get poisoned.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
All right. So let's take a look at our dialogue for the first time and see why we are talking about poison.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
And we'll come back and explain some great words.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
Please, make yourselves at home. Let me take your coats.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Dinner's almost ready. I hope you brought your appetite.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Well, house is lovely, Armand. Very interesting, decor. Very gothic.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
I think it's amazing. Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm thinking of redecorating my house. Maybe you could give me a few pointers.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
It would be my pleasure. Please have a seat. Can I offer you a glass of wine?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
We would love some.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Here you are. A very special Merlot, brought directly from my home country.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Mmm, it's delicious.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
It's a bit bitter for my taste. Almost tastes like, like, Ellen. Ellen, are you okay?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Did she pass out? Yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much. You'll ruin our meal.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Okay, so that was unexpected. I know. Lowest. Can you believe it?

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Apparently lowest is helping our mom. I know. Maybe she's a vampire.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
All right. Well, I really wonder what's going to happen next.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
Well, see what happens next. But now let's take a look at some of the language in language takeaway.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Language takeaway.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
All right. So we have a couple of words in language takeaway today. Let's start off with pointers.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
pointers.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
pointers.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
So to give somebody pointers, you give them some suggestions.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Suggestions or tips. Exactly.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
All right. So suggestions or tips. Let's listen to some examples of how you would use it.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Example one.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
I want to dance salsa better. Can you give me a few pointers?

04:33.000 --> 04:41.000
Example two.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
I need some pointers on how to be a better manager.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Example three.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
Let me give you a few pointers so you can pass your exam.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
All right. So pointers. It's clear now. Let's take a look at our next word.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Aroma aroma aroma aroma.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
This is a nice round word.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Yeah. Well, this word makes you sound really educated.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah. Yeah. Basically it means smell smell.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Yep. So you could say for example, this coffee has a great aroma.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
Or maybe this perfume has the aroma of roses and lavender.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Nice. Okay. Let's take a look at our next word.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Better. Better.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Be iter. Be iter. Be iter. Be iter. Be iter.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
So bitter is the opposite of sweet of sweet.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
So it's always hard to describe taste, isn't it?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah. But maybe we can we can say a few foods that are bitter.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Okay. So chocolate when it has no sugar is bitter.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Okay. Or for example coffee without any sugar is also bitter.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah. And sometimes red wine can be quite bitter.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Mm-hmm. So bitter. Okay. And now let's take a look at our last word.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Pass out. Pass out. Pass out. Pass out.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
It seems kind of easy pass and out. Yep. But it means something different.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah. When you put them together. What does it mean?

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
It means faint or become unconscious. Okay.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
So imagine someone, you know, they're standing up and then suddenly they start to

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
move around and then fall over to the ground. Okay. Pass out.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Yes. This usually happens when you get really really drunk.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Maybe sometimes also maybe your pregnant. You might pass out. Right.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Okay. To lose consciousness. Yes.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Marco and I have a couple of examples of this word for you.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Example one.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
I drink so much last night that I passed out at my friend's house.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Example two.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
She was standing in the sun too long so she passed out right in front of me.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Example three.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
My sister passes out whenever she sees blood.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
All right. So let's listen to our dialogue again now.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
And you'll be able to hear these words that we just talked about.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Please make yourselves at home.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Let me take your coats.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Dinner is almost ready.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I hope you brought your appetite.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Your house is lovely, Armand.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Very interesting decor.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Very gothic.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I think it's amazing.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
You have such good taste Armand.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Maybe you could give me a few pointers.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
It would be my pleasure.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Please have a seat.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
We would love some.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Here you are.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
A very special Merlot brought directly from my home country.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
It has unique ingredient which gives it a pleasant aroma

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
and superior flavor.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Mmm.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It's delicious.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Almost tastes like like Ellen.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Ellen, are you okay?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Did she pass out?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
I hope that you didn't poison her drink too much.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
You'll ruin our meal.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
All right. So interesting story.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yes.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
We have some great phrases that we've used here.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
So let's take a look at them in fluency builder.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Fluency builder.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
We've got four phrases for you that are great to use when you want to welcome someone

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
into your house or into your office or anywhere, really.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Exactly.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
So why don't we take a look at the first one?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Please make yourselves at home.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Please make yourselves at home.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Please make yourself at home.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
So this is a very common phrase when you invite somebody to your house.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
You always use this phrase.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
It's like make yourself comfortable, relax, down.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Don't worry about it.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Like my house is your house.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Exactly.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Please make yourself at home.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Okay.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Good one.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Usually people arrive to a party or to a dinner with jackets, coats, scarves.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Mmm.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
All that stuff.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
So this next phrase is really handy.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Let me take your coats.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Let me take your coats.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Let me take your coats.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
So that means give me your coats and I'll put them in the closet.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Right.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Let me take your coats.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
And then a good host would always offer a drink, right?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Exactly.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Water or in this case wine.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
So they would say, can I offer you a glass of wine?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Mm-hmm.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Or sometimes you could say, can I offer you a glass?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Can I offer you something to drink?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
So can I offer you a glass of wine?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Mm-hmm.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
You offer me a glass of wine.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I say, yeah, sure.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I'll take a glass of wine.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
All right.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
And then I would use our next phrase.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Here you are.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Here you are.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Here you are.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Exactly.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
It doesn't mean that you are here.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
No.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
It's saying to someone, here it is.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Take it.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yes.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yes.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
You know what?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
This is a really, really great phrase.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
A lot of people who are learning English don't say this.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
But it's really common.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Really natural.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
And if you use it, you'll sound really great.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Mm-hmm.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Here you are.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Here you are.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Here you are.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
You can use this anytime you give someone something.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Right.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
So if you give somebody a pen or a pencil and notebook, here you are.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Here it is.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Yep.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Okay.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Great words.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
So let's listen to our dialogue one more time and then we'll come back.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Please make yourselves at home.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Well, let me take your coats.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Dinner's almost ready.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I hope you brought your appetite.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Well, house is lovely, Armand.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Very interesting, decor.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Very gothic.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I think it's amazing.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Maybe you could give me a few pointers.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
It would be my pleasure.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Please have a seat.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
We would love some.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Here you are.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
A very special Merlot.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Brought directly from my home country.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Mm-hmm.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
It's delicious.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Almost tastes like... like...

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Ellen?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Ellen?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Are you okay?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Did she pass out?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
You'll ruin our meal.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Okay, so Armand is a pretty good host.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
He offered them a Merlot.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Yeah, which is the type of wine.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
And this is really interesting because there are many types of wines.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Do you know any?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I know lots.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
All right, so give us some pointers here.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
All right, Merlot was probably like the most common red wine, right?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Mm-hmm.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
And Merlot was actually the great variety.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
The great variety.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
For it all.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It's called a wine speak.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Wow, for it all.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Yeah.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Well, right now I'm really liking to drink tempernio, which is a Spanish wine.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Tempernio.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Really?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
And is that also the type of grape?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Yes.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Oh, nice.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Usually we would say red wine or white wine, right?

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
But the varieties depending on the grapes is what gives them their names.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Mm-hmm.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
So we also have a couple of other, like maybe you have a Shardiné.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
White wine?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
White wine.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You have a Cabernet Sauvignon.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Red wine?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Red wine again.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yep.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
And my personal favorite is a carbonare.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh, yeah, that's a nice wine.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
That's a nice wine.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Not very common anymore.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Apparently the grape isn't growing very well in France anymore or in Spain.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
So from what I understand, it's only in Chile and Argentina.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
But it's a really good...

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
How do Argentina makes really good come here?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
But you know who else makes good wine?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Who?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Canadians.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Really?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Yes.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Canadian wine.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
You almost never find it outside of Canada, but there is one region in the Western

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
part of the country that makes really, really good wines, especially some nice

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
wine.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Nice.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Nice.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
All right.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, what about in your country is you produce any wine or maybe any other type of drink?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yes.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Right?

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Many countries have their own types of drinks, so we want to know about it.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Tell us.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
And many countries have different traditions to be hospitable to be welcoming.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Yeah.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
That's a good one.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.
