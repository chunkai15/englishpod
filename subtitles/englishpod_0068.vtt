00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
Welcome back English learners, my name is Marco, and I'm joined here by the lovely Erica.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.600
And today we're going to be bringing you another great lesson, one of the lessons that you requested.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.280
Yes, that's right. Actually, Maxa, Maxim S requested this one.

00:15.280 --> 00:24.000
Right, I think he's really into research and investigation, so we're bringing you a great lesson about this topic.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.720
Okay, so I'm really excited to hear this dialogue all about research.

00:28.720 --> 00:34.640
So why don't we start listening to two university professors discussing an important question?

00:39.920 --> 00:44.400
We've been over this a thousand times, the data is irrefutable.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.640
Look, we've done extensive research, built studies and read the literature,

00:48.640 --> 00:51.680
and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory.

00:51.680 --> 00:58.800
Horowitz, I beg to differ. Even in your most recent study, the investigative approach was flawed.

00:59.600 --> 01:05.360
You know as well, I do, the collection of data was not systematic, and there's a large margin of error.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.320
To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading.

01:08.960 --> 01:14.640
Doctors preposterous. You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world's greatest mysteries,

01:14.640 --> 01:19.280
and yet you're oblivious to the fact that you're wrong or are not wrong.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.960
Look, chicken came first. No! The egg came first.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.920
Look, chicken, egg! Look, chicken, the egg! Look, chicken, the egg! Look, chicken, the egg! Look, chicken, the egg!

01:25.920 --> 01:27.920
Look, chicken, the egg!

01:33.920 --> 01:37.600
All right, so interesting, which came first, the chicken or the egg?

01:37.600 --> 01:40.320
It's an age-old question, isn't it?

01:40.320 --> 01:44.080
And apparently, they are not going to agree anytime soon.

01:44.080 --> 01:48.480
All right, well, what they can agree about is this awesome language.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.360
So why don't we take a look at it now in language takeaway?

01:53.120 --> 01:54.240
Language takeaway.

01:55.280 --> 02:00.240
Okay, on language takeaway today, we have some really great words, and this first one is really good.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.640
Irreffutable. Irreffutable. Irreffutable.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.640
The data is irreffutable.

02:06.640 --> 02:12.960
Okay, so if the professor says that the data is irreffutable, what does he mean by that?

02:13.040 --> 02:17.920
He's saying that you cannot deny it. It is really, really true.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.560
It is really true. There is no way this is a lie.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.720
Exactly. Okay, irreffutable evidence, for example.

02:24.720 --> 02:30.880
Yeah, that's a great phrase. All right, so the professor complained that Dr. Harlwitz's experiment

02:30.880 --> 02:38.880
was flawed, flawed, so flawed. Is that an adjective of rubber and noun?

02:39.840 --> 02:46.880
It is an adjective here. Now, when something is flawed, there is a problem with it, right?

02:46.880 --> 02:48.880
There's a mistake. There's an error. Yep.

02:48.880 --> 02:54.320
Okay, so this adjective is a way of saying that his experiment has a flaw.

02:54.320 --> 02:59.920
A mistake, exactly. So flawed is the adjective of a flaw, right?

02:59.920 --> 03:07.680
Okay, now the reason that his study or his experiment was flawed is because it was not systematic.

03:08.560 --> 03:14.160
Systematic. Systematic. So systematic. That's an interesting word.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.920
Hmm. Now, I think we can recognize the word system in here, right?

03:17.920 --> 03:23.040
Hmm. Right? So when something is systematic, it follows a process.

03:23.040 --> 03:28.160
A certain order. Yes, a certain system. Right, so that's basically what systematic means to follow

03:28.160 --> 03:33.840
a certain order to be more organized, right? Exactly. Yep. Okay. And what about our next word?

03:34.000 --> 03:40.480
Proposterous. Proposterous. Proposterous. That is preposterous. I love this phrase.

03:40.480 --> 03:46.320
It usually goes together, right? That is preposterous. Yep. Okay, so what does it mean when I say that?

03:46.320 --> 03:51.760
It means it's absurd. It's ridiculous. Right, it doesn't make sense.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.520
Hmm. I can't believe you said that. All right, well, this is a really interesting phrase,

03:55.520 --> 04:00.880
but I think it's a little bit more common when it's used by older people.

04:00.960 --> 04:06.400
Yeah, I don't think I don't really see a young person going up to someone and say,

04:06.400 --> 04:11.280
hey, that's preposterous. Yeah, but it is a wonderful phrase. Now, our final phrase

04:11.280 --> 04:16.240
we're going to take away oblivious. A oblivious. You're oblivious to the fact.

04:17.120 --> 04:23.520
So a person that is oblivious to something. They don't know or they're unaware. Okay, so

04:23.520 --> 04:28.480
they ignore maybe the fact. So or. Exactly. They don't see it. Yeah. You're oblivious to the fact

04:28.480 --> 04:34.560
that we're in a recession. Okay, or he is completely oblivious. You can just say like that,

04:34.560 --> 04:38.880
right? Yeah, he doesn't know. Mm-hmm. Okay, so we took a look at some of the great vocabulary

04:38.880 --> 04:43.680
we found it in the dialogue, but there were also some really good phrases that I think we should

04:43.680 --> 04:46.720
look at. Okay, and let's take a look at those and putting it together.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.320
Putting it together.

04:52.480 --> 04:58.240
You know, Markle, one of the things I love about English is the way that words seem to

04:58.240 --> 05:04.000
fit together, like blocks coming together. And here we have a lot of great examples of these words

05:04.000 --> 05:09.120
that fit together really nicely. Okay, so why don't we look at those? And our first one now is

05:09.920 --> 05:12.240
extensive research.

05:12.240 --> 05:19.760
Extensive research. Extensive research. All right, so we know extensive means a lot. A lot. Yeah,

05:19.760 --> 05:24.800
so that's really good. When you put it together, extensive research. It means you have a lot of

05:24.800 --> 05:29.040
research. You have really studied, you have really looked things up. Mm-hmm. Okay,

05:29.040 --> 05:36.240
extensive research. Another great research related phrase here is conclusive evidence.

05:37.120 --> 05:42.960
Conclusive evidence. Inclusive evidence. All right, now the first word they're conclusive.

05:42.960 --> 05:48.960
When something is conclusive, you can't argue with that. It's the final decision. All right,

05:49.600 --> 05:56.240
the professor complained that Harlwitz's, that Harlwitz's investigative approach was flawed, right?

05:57.200 --> 06:05.280
So this is our next phrase, investigative approach. Investigate of approach. Okay, so I remember

06:05.280 --> 06:10.800
the word investigative is a verb. Yes. But in this case, it's an adjective, an adjective.

06:10.800 --> 06:16.640
When something is investigative, it's obviously having to do with an investigation. Mm-hmm.

06:16.640 --> 06:24.320
So the approach or the, so when he said investigative approach, just the, I mean, just simply

06:24.320 --> 06:31.760
the way you investigate. Okay, the problem, the way he investigated. Okay, very interesting.

06:31.760 --> 06:37.360
What about this other phrase that I saw it was really interesting? Definitive conclusion. Definitive

06:37.360 --> 06:44.640
conclusion. So a definitive conclusion. All right, well again, I think we know the word conclusion,

06:44.640 --> 06:50.880
right? Okay. So it's a final judgment or decision. All right. When something is definitive,

06:51.440 --> 06:57.760
you can't argue with it or change it. Okay, so the conclusion or the, the final

06:58.800 --> 07:05.440
result is, is final. Like there is no way of arguing it. Exactly. Okay. All right,

07:05.520 --> 07:10.880
definitive conclusion. This is some great language. So why don't we listen to it one more time

07:10.880 --> 07:21.360
in the dialogue? We've been over this a thousand times. The data is irrefutable. Look,

07:21.360 --> 07:26.800
we've done extensive research, built studies and read the literature, and there is conclusive evidence

07:26.800 --> 07:33.440
to support my theory. Horowitz, I beg to differ. Evening your most recent study,

07:33.520 --> 07:38.880
the investigative approach was flawed. You know as well, lie to you, the collection of data was not

07:38.880 --> 07:43.520
systematic and there's a large margin of error to draw a definitive conclusion based on that

07:43.520 --> 07:49.680
data would be misleading. Doctors preposterous. You are trying to single-handedly solve one of

07:49.680 --> 07:55.040
the world's greatest mysteries, and yet you're oblivious to the fact that you're wrong or are not

07:55.040 --> 08:02.560
wrong. Look, chicken came first. No, the egg came first. Look, chicken, egg. Look, the egg. Look,

08:02.560 --> 08:14.000
look, the egg. So an interesting question. What do you think? What came first? The chicken or the egg?

08:14.000 --> 08:19.520
Well, if you ask me, it was the egg. It was the egg. Yeah, interesting. What about

08:19.520 --> 08:25.360
why did the chicken cross the road? To catch the other side? Do you think that's really the reason?

08:25.360 --> 08:28.720
Well, there's a million different reasons, but this is great. I'm glad you brought that up,

08:28.720 --> 08:34.720
because this is like the classic English joke. The classic English joke, right? Why did the chicken

08:34.720 --> 08:39.680
cross the road and the answer is always? Well, there are a million answers. So do you guys know

08:39.680 --> 08:44.000
any chicken jokes? Yeah, why don't you come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and on the

08:44.000 --> 08:49.360
comment section, why don't you leave us your thoughts on what came first? The chicken or the egg?

08:49.360 --> 08:53.920
And why do you think the chicken cross the road? All right. Well, we really look forward to hearing

08:53.920 --> 08:58.640
your ideas, and Marco and I will be around to answer your questions. So I think we're out of time for

08:58.640 --> 09:10.640
today, but thanks for listening, and we'll see you there. Goodbye. Bye.
