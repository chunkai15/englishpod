Hello English learners welcome back to English pot my name is Marco and I'm

00:05.880 --> 00:10.680
Erica and today we're bringing you part four of our romantic series called I'm

00:10.680 --> 00:14.400
sorry I love you. Yeah and today we've got some drama I don't

00:14.400 --> 00:18.520
wait. We got a lot of drama and we got a lot of useful language. Yeah we're

00:18.520 --> 00:23.600
going to learn some phrases we can use to describe a mistake and we're

00:23.600 --> 00:28.640
also going to learn how we can comfort someone. We can make them feel better.

00:28.640 --> 00:34.440
Okay exactly so in our dialogue today Veronica and her boyfriend are on a break.

00:34.440 --> 00:39.200
Right. So what does it mean to be on a break? Well it means you stop having a

00:39.200 --> 00:43.880
romantic relationship for a short time. So you can say we are on a break.

00:43.880 --> 00:47.000
So we're not dating. We're not dating. But we don't date.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.240
Alright.

00:49.240 --> 00:52.680
However we could say let's take a break.

00:52.680 --> 00:57.040
Right. So we've got the state on a break and the action take a break.

00:57.080 --> 01:01.120
Okay. Let's take a break. Okay. So let's listen to our dialogue and it's

01:01.120 --> 01:04.760
going to be a little bit fast and the girl I think she's crying so it'll be

01:04.760 --> 01:08.240
a little bit difficult to understand. But Marco and I will come back in a minute

01:08.240 --> 01:10.400
and we'll talk about some of the difficult language here.

01:10.400 --> 01:29.640
So so I said let's take a break and since that night I've been waiting for him to call

01:29.640 --> 01:35.080
but I still haven't heard from him. You don't think he's seeing someone else do you?

01:35.160 --> 01:41.160
Come on. Don't be so dramatic. I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

01:41.160 --> 01:47.720
You think so? Oh no. How could he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me.

01:47.720 --> 01:51.720
Why else would he call? But you two are on a break.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.440
Theoretically he can do whatever he likes.

01:54.440 --> 02:01.320
He's a love of my life. I really mess this up.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.400
Come on, hun. Pull yourself together. It's going to be all right.

02:11.480 --> 02:18.360
But I... I still love him and it's all my fault. I can't believe how immature

02:18.360 --> 02:24.200
and selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter. It's not like he can just leave

02:24.200 --> 02:30.360
someone in the burning building and meet me for dinner. I'm totally messed this up.

02:30.840 --> 02:36.440
You know what Veronica? I think you should make the first step. I'm sure he'll forgive you.

02:36.440 --> 02:42.200
No. This is not going to happen. I... I'm ruined. Everything!

02:44.200 --> 02:45.720
Hey, do you hear something?

02:50.920 --> 02:53.720
It's your lovely firefighter.

03:00.360 --> 03:27.720
Wow, that's a romantic boyfriend singing in the street. Yeah, that's amazing. Have you ever

03:27.800 --> 03:34.680
done that for a girl? No. Have you ever sung to a girl at KTV?

03:34.680 --> 03:40.440
I've sung to a girl at KTV. And karaoke. karaoke, yeah. So, but not so much as an

03:40.440 --> 03:44.360
industry with all the neighbors coming out to see me. Wow, okay. Well, I don't blame you.

03:45.160 --> 03:49.320
All right, let's take a look at the language that we saw in our dialogue. On language takeaway.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.360
Language takeaway. All right, so let's take a look at our first word.

03:56.520 --> 04:03.160
Seeing someone. Seeing someone. Seeing someone. Seeing someone. So if I'm seeing someone.

04:03.160 --> 04:07.640
You're dating them. I'm dating them. Yeah. I'm frequently going out with that person.

04:07.640 --> 04:14.520
Right. So, but it's not very serious. No, it is serious. But not really. It's more of a casual

04:14.520 --> 04:19.320
thing. It's not very exclusive. So, so if you are seeing someone, then you can also

04:19.960 --> 04:26.600
see another person. Maybe. Hmm. Well, I think sometimes seeing someone can mean actually

04:26.600 --> 04:32.520
their your boyfriend or girlfriend. Like, I'm seeing John. He's my boyfriend. Okay. Yeah, see, this is

04:32.520 --> 04:36.920
the difficult thing about seeing someone is that for some people, it means it's really serious.

04:36.920 --> 04:41.560
Well, for other people, it means it's more casual. I guess it's important that you and your

04:41.560 --> 04:46.520
boyfriend or girlfriend share the same view on the meeting of this word. Have to agree on what

04:46.600 --> 04:52.520
seeing someone means. Okay. Well, what's their next word, Marco? Cheating on. Cheating on someone.

04:52.520 --> 05:00.280
Cheating on me. Cheating on someone. Okay. So, if you're cheating on someone, then you are like

05:00.280 --> 05:05.880
kissing or even having sex with someone who's not your boyfriend or your husband or your girlfriend

05:05.880 --> 05:13.160
or wife. Exactly. So, if I say, she cheated on me. Hmm. That means that my girlfriend

05:13.240 --> 05:19.160
kissed or had sex with another guy. Right. But if I say, she cheated me. Yeah, that's different.

05:19.160 --> 05:23.240
That's different. It's different. Maybe she sold you something for a really high price.

05:23.240 --> 05:29.480
She cheated me. Yeah. Or maybe she sold me something that was fake. Or yeah, or broken or broken.

05:29.480 --> 05:34.440
Yeah. Okay. So, cheated on is really different from cheated. Okay. Let's take a look at our next

05:34.440 --> 05:43.080
word. Mess this up. Messed this up. Messed this up. So, Marco, this is a phrasal verb.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.800
And that means we can sort of switch it around a little bit, right? Exactly. Why don't we

05:47.800 --> 05:52.840
listen to some examples? And then we can come back and talk some more. Example one.

05:55.080 --> 06:01.880
I messed up on the exam and now I won't pass my class. Example two.

06:04.440 --> 06:11.320
When I'm cooking, I always mess up and burn the rice. Okay. So, messed up. It's pretty clear, I think.

06:11.320 --> 06:16.920
Yeah. All right. Let's take a look at our next word. In mature. In mature. In mature.

06:16.920 --> 06:21.960
In mature. So, when someone is immature, they're acting really young. Really young, right?

06:21.960 --> 06:27.240
But it's not a very good thing to be immature. No, it has a negative meaning. Right.

06:27.240 --> 06:32.440
It's normal for children to be immature. Because they're children. Right. But not an adult. Yes.

06:32.440 --> 06:37.320
Okay. So, we've got some examples that will help you to understand this word a little bit better.

06:37.400 --> 06:44.360
Example one. Your toilet jokes are not funny. Stop being so immature.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.480
Example two.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.520
Jeannie acts like she's 16. She's so immature.

06:55.320 --> 07:01.000
Example three. God, you and your friends always act so immature.

07:01.640 --> 07:09.640
All right. So, immature. Now, let's take a look at our next word. Selfish. Selfish. Selfish.

07:09.640 --> 07:17.640
Selfish. So, a selfish person is a person who only thinks about themselves. Okay. So, I only think about me.

07:18.280 --> 07:25.640
No one else. Yeah. You don't care about other people's feelings. Okay. So, it's not a good thing to be immature or selfish. Exactly.

07:25.720 --> 07:30.200
Okay. So, I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again. We're going to slow it down a little bit.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.560
And this will help you to understand these phrases a little bit more clearly.

07:39.560 --> 07:46.760
So, I said, let's take a break. And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call,

07:47.480 --> 07:53.160
but I still haven't heard from him. You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

07:53.800 --> 08:01.080
Come on. Don't be so dramatic. I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

08:01.800 --> 08:11.000
You think so? Oh, no! How can he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me.

08:12.040 --> 08:21.160
Why else wouldn't he call? But you two are on a break, theoretically. He can do whatever he likes.

08:22.120 --> 08:32.280
He's the love of my life. I've really messed this up. Come on, hunt, pull yourself together.

08:32.840 --> 08:40.360
It's going to be all right. But I still love him. And it's all my fault.

08:41.240 --> 08:49.960
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter.

08:50.680 --> 08:57.480
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

08:58.440 --> 09:06.360
I've totally messed this up. You know what Veronica? I think you should make the first step.

09:07.080 --> 09:16.200
I'm sure he'll forgive you. No, this is not going to happen. I, I've ruined everything.

09:17.160 --> 09:23.560
Hey, do you hear something? Guess what? It's your lovely firefighter.

09:34.360 --> 09:39.400
Okay, so we saw Veronica's friend trying to calm her down. Yeah, trying to comfort her. Okay,

09:39.400 --> 09:44.520
to make her feel better. Let's take a look at some of the phrases she used in fluency builder.

09:45.480 --> 09:53.000
Fluency builder. Okay, so what was the first phrase that she said? Everything is going to work out just fine.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
Everything is going to work out just fine. Everything is going to work out just fine. What does that mean?

09:59.000 --> 10:03.480
It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay, right? Yeah, the problem will be solved. Okay.

10:03.480 --> 10:10.760
So if somebody's worried or somebody is crying, you can say, oh, don't worry. Everything is going to work out just fine.

10:11.640 --> 10:17.400
Okay, okay, let's look at the next one. Pull yourself together. Pull yourself together.

10:17.400 --> 10:22.360
Pull yourself together. Pull yourself together. So what does that mean exactly? It's kind of weird.

10:22.360 --> 10:29.960
I know, I guess it just means stop crying, relax, and you know, take a deep breath. Okay, just like calm down.

10:29.960 --> 10:36.040
Yeah, you get organized with your ideas and your thoughts. Yeah, so you can think of maybe somebody who's got

10:36.200 --> 10:43.640
tears down their face and everything is sort of in a mess. If you pull it together, they clean up and they sort of relax, right?

10:43.640 --> 10:48.600
Okay, pull yourself together. Mm-hmm. All right, and the last phrase that we saw,

10:49.240 --> 10:56.920
it's going to be all right. It's going to be all right. It's going to be all right. So it's going to be all right.

10:56.920 --> 11:03.080
Means everything is going to be okay. Yeah, it's going to be fine. It's going to be fine.

11:03.080 --> 11:07.960
The problem will go away. You'll feel better. Maybe you could even say it'll be all right.

11:07.960 --> 11:13.640
Yeah. Yeah. It'll be all right. Yeah. These are three really helpful phrases that you can use when you

11:13.640 --> 11:19.640
want to say something nice to a friend or a colleague who who has a problem. Okay, exactly.

11:19.640 --> 11:24.280
Very useful language. So let's listen to some more examples. Example one.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.440
Don't worry, everything's going to work out. Just fine. I'm sure he still loves you.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.600
Example two.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.040
Everything's going to be all right. We'll find your puppy. Don't worry.

11:46.920 --> 11:52.280
Okay, great examples, and I think it's clear now. So let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll

11:52.280 --> 11:53.480
come back and talk some more.

11:53.720 --> 12:06.120
So, so I said, let's take a break. And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call,

12:06.120 --> 12:12.520
but I still haven't heard from him. You don't think he's seeing someone else do you? Come on.

12:12.520 --> 12:18.840
Don't be so dramatic. I'm sure everything is going to work out. Just fine. You think so?

12:19.800 --> 12:25.480
Oh no, how could he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me. Why else would he call?

12:26.440 --> 12:32.680
But you two are on a break. He already can do whatever he likes. He's in love with my life.

12:35.640 --> 12:41.720
I really messes up. Come on, hun. Pull your song together. It's going to be all right.

12:41.720 --> 12:55.000
But I... I still love him, and it's all my fault. I can't believe how immature and

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter. It's not like he can just leave someone

13:01.000 --> 13:08.840
in the burning building and meet me for dinner. I'm totally mess this up. You know what Veronica,

13:08.840 --> 13:15.320
I think you should make the first step. I'm sure he'll forgive you. No. This is not going to happen.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.120
I ruined everything. Hey, do you hear something?

13:22.120 --> 13:30.360
Yes, it's your lovely firefighter.

13:53.080 --> 13:59.800
Okay, I really like this dialogue. It's so romantic. Yeah, it's drama, but at the same

13:59.800 --> 14:05.880
time romantic. So we want to know what you think will happen next. Yeah, well, they get back together.

14:05.880 --> 14:09.560
Well, they get married. Well, they have a baby. Maybe they'll break up forever.

14:10.120 --> 14:16.120
Maybe she'll move halfway across the world. Anything could happen. So let us know what you think will

14:16.120 --> 14:21.720
