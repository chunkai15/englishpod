00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
Hello everyone, welcome to EnglishPod.

00:03.440 --> 00:04.940
Today I'm here with Erica.

00:04.940 --> 00:05.780
Hi, Marco.

00:05.780 --> 00:06.600
And I'm Marco.

00:07.600 --> 00:11.200
And we're bringing you a great elementary lesson about a situation at an office.

00:11.200 --> 00:11.880
That's true.

00:11.880 --> 00:16.440
Today we're going to learn some phrases for asking for time off.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.520
Right, asking for time off or asking for leave.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.880
Asking for leave, right?

00:20.880 --> 00:26.440
Right. So we're going to give you some great phrases and vocabulary for when you want to ask for leave.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.400
So let's just listen to our dialogue today.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.440
We're at an office where live wants some time off.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.680
Mr. McKenna, do you have a second?

00:44.680 --> 00:46.280
I need to talk to you about something.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.200
Sure, live.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.440
What kind of do you for you?

00:48.440 --> 00:53.960
Well, I was just wondering, you see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.160
But my sister's getting married and the wedding is over season.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.160
Well, you want to take some time off, is that right?

01:00.160 --> 01:04.960
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.760
What dates are you planning on taking off?

01:06.760 --> 01:10.160
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.960
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.760
Would you be okay with that?

01:16.760 --> 01:19.560
Well, I guess so.

01:23.960 --> 01:29.360
Well, it sounds like the boss wasn't too happy about lives request.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.360
Well, she wanted to take off for 30 days.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.360
So I guess that is a long time.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.560
That is a long time.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.560
I wish I could do that.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.560
Yeah.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.960
Okay, we have some great words for you today.

01:39.960 --> 01:43.960
So let's start with our language takeaway.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.160
Language takeaway.

01:46.160 --> 01:50.360
For words on our language takeaway today, Erica, why don't you tell us the first one?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.960
The first word is vacation days.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.960
Vacation days.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.360
So what are vacation days?

01:57.360 --> 02:02.760
Basically, it's the number of personal leave days.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.960
So the number of days that you can take to go on vacation.

02:05.960 --> 02:06.760
Mm-hmm.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.960
How many vacation days do you have?

02:08.960 --> 02:10.560
Yeah, I think I have not so many.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.760
I only have 10 vacation days.

02:12.760 --> 02:13.760
And vacation.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.560
Well, in some countries, there are 10 vacation days is normal.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.160
Another, I guess, it's 10, 15, even 20, I've heard.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.160
Yeah, yeah.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.360
Well, vacation days.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.960
We can't take too many vacation days.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.560
There also won't make any more podcasts.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.560
I know.

02:27.560 --> 02:35.160
Why don't we look at our second word overseas overseas overseas overseas?

02:35.160 --> 02:38.760
When you travel overseas, you travel over the ocean.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.360
Over the ocean to another country.

02:40.360 --> 02:40.960
Exactly.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.560
Okay, overseas.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.760
Okay, and our third word for language takeaway.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.360
Unpaid leave.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.560
Unpaid leave.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.960
Unpaid leave.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.560
So this is time off without pay.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.560
With our pay.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.560
Simple.

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
Right.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.560
Unpaid leave.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.160
And our last word.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.160
Notice.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.160
Notice.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.160
Notice.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
Notice.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.960
So we have some great examples on how we use notice.

03:05.960 --> 03:11.560
And from these examples, I'm sure you'll be able to understand exactly what they mean.

03:11.560 --> 03:16.960
Example one.

03:16.960 --> 03:20.760
If you want to quit your job, make sure you give enough notice.

03:20.960 --> 03:27.760
You'll need to tell us four weeks in advance.

03:28.760 --> 03:34.760
Example two.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.560
You didn't give me enough notice about this project.

03:37.560 --> 03:44.160
I didn't have enough time to finish it.

03:44.160 --> 03:48.160
So when you give someone notice, you give them information in advance.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.160
In advance, right?

03:49.160 --> 03:54.360
So if I want to take time off, I need to give my boss notice, advance information.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.360
Right.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.360
15 day notice.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.360
20 day notice.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.360
Yeah.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.360
Great.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.960
So that's our language takeaway for today.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.760
Now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

04:04.760 --> 04:13.560
And this time it's going to be really slow.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.560
Mr. McKenna, do you have a second?

04:16.560 --> 04:19.160
I need to talk to you about something.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.960
Sure, live.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.960
What can I do for you?

04:22.960 --> 04:26.960
Well, I was just wondering, you see.

04:26.960 --> 04:32.360
I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister is getting married.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.960
And the wedding is over season.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.360
Well, you want to take some time off.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.760
Is that right?

04:40.160 --> 04:47.160
Well, sir, I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.760
What dates are you planning on taking off?

04:49.760 --> 04:54.560
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

04:54.560 --> 05:00.360
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.240
Would you be okay with that?

05:02.240 --> 05:03.360
I guess so.

05:04.360 --> 05:14.360
A lot of non-native English speakers sometimes feel quite nervous about asking their boss

05:14.360 --> 05:15.360
for time off.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.360
Hey.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.360
Yeah, I guess it's a kind of a difficult subject.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.360
Yeah, but today we're going to teach you some great phrases that you can use next time

05:23.360 --> 05:25.360
you need to ask for some time off.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.360
Great.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.360
So why don't we take a look at putting it together?

05:30.360 --> 05:32.360
Put it together.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.360
Okay, so I'm putting it together today.

05:35.360 --> 05:40.360
We're going to talk about some great phrases that you can use when approaching your boss.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.360
Yes, we heard live say this.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.360
Do you have a second?

05:46.360 --> 05:49.360
Do you have a second?

05:49.360 --> 05:54.360
This is a nice way to make sure your boss isn't busy when you want to ask them something.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.360
Right, right.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.360
Right, but we could also say this in two different ways.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.360
Let's listen.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
Do you have a minute?

06:01.360 --> 06:03.360
I want to ask you something.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.360
Do you have a sec?

06:05.360 --> 06:07.360
I need to talk to you.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.360
A great way to approach your boss.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.360
Yeah, I love this phrase.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.360
Do you have a sec?

06:12.360 --> 06:13.360
Yeah, do you have a sec?

06:13.360 --> 06:15.360
It's really natural.

06:15.360 --> 06:19.360
Okay, so you've asked your boss for leave and you want to make sure that he agrees with you.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.360
Yes.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.360
And this is how lived it.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.360
Would you be okay with that?

06:25.360 --> 06:28.360
Would you be okay with that?

06:29.360 --> 06:34.360
This is a great pattern and we've got two other examples of how you can use it.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.360
Example one.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.360
Are you all right with that?

06:39.360 --> 06:42.360
Example two.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.360
Will you be okay with this?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.360
Example three.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.360
I'm fine with that.

06:50.360 --> 06:54.360
Okay, great examples, great patterns, really useful language.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.360
Yes.

06:55.360 --> 07:05.360
Okay, so now let's listen to her dialogue a third time.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.360
Mr. McKenna, do you have a second?

07:08.360 --> 07:10.360
I need to talk to you about something.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.360
Sure, live.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.360
What kind of do you for you?

07:12.360 --> 07:15.360
Well, I was just wondering, you see,

07:15.360 --> 07:19.360
I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister is getting married

07:19.360 --> 07:21.360
and the wedding is over season.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.360
Well, you want to take some time off.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.360
Is that right?

07:24.360 --> 07:28.360
Well, sir, I was just hoping I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.360
What dates are you planning on taking off?

07:30.360 --> 07:33.360
I'll need at least two months notice so that I can plan for your absence.

07:33.360 --> 07:38.360
I was thinking of taking off from September 1st until the 30th.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.360
Would you be okay with that?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.360
Well, I guess so.

07:43.360 --> 07:53.360
I really noticed how live in this dialogue used a lot of really polite language,

07:53.360 --> 07:54.360
okay?

07:54.360 --> 07:57.360
Yeah, I guess when you're talking to your boss, you really have to be respectful,

07:57.360 --> 07:59.360
and you have to use really polite language.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.360
What sort of things did she do to make herself seem more polite?

08:02.360 --> 08:05.360
Well, she said a couple of interesting phrases.

08:05.360 --> 08:09.360
For example, well, I was just wondering.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.360
Yeah, I was just wondering.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.360
Right.

08:12.360 --> 08:16.360
It's like, well, she's kind of setting up to ask for a favor or something.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.360
Yeah.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.360
And she also used another phrase that I thought was interesting.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.360
Yeah, she also said, I was just hoping that, yes.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.360
Right.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.360
I was just hoping that maybe I could take some time off.

08:28.360 --> 08:32.360
Yeah, again, that sort of doesn't sound too strong.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.360
Right.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.360
So it seems a bit more polite.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.360
Yeah, because if she said, well, I want to take some time off.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
That's too strong.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.360
Yeah.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.360
So I was just hoping.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.360
And then, well, the boss says, okay, well, when do you want to leave?

08:44.360 --> 08:48.360
And she says, well, I was thinking of, right?

08:48.360 --> 08:49.360
I was thinking of.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.360
Yeah.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.360
Again, if she would have said, I want to, yes, too strong, right?

08:54.360 --> 09:00.360
Yeah, in English, sometimes we are careful to not be too direct when we're asking

09:00.360 --> 09:02.360
for something, right?

09:02.360 --> 09:03.360
Right.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.360
Yeah.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.360
Because if you're too direct, you sound a little bit impolite.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.360
Yeah, you sound rude.

09:08.360 --> 09:09.360
Yeah.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.360
Okay.

09:10.360 --> 09:14.360
So great tips and great things to take into consideration the next time you're

09:14.360 --> 09:15.360
talking into your boss.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
All right, guys.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.360
We're out of time, but thanks for listening.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.360
And be sure to check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.360
Right.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.360
Where you can leave all your questions in comments, and we'll be there to answer

09:25.360 --> 09:26.360
them.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.360
But I guess until then, it's goodbye.
