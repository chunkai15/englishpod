00:00.000 --> 00:10.720
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marko and my name is Katherine and we've got a great lesson for you today

00:10.720 --> 00:16.080
What level is this? Marko. This is an elementary lesson and we're gonna be touching one of these

00:16.880 --> 00:22.800
Medical topics today. We're gonna talk about chicken pox. Oh gosh. I hated the chicken pox

00:23.120 --> 00:27.760
They're horrible and they each and you can't do anything about it and your parents say don't scratch

00:28.240 --> 00:37.280
Right so chicken pox is a illness that you get usually as a child and what happens is you start getting these little red dots all over your body

00:37.680 --> 00:44.320
Like little mosquito bites exactly and they come all over your body arms legs a face and

00:44.640 --> 00:49.680
You can only get this disease once unless maybe you didn't really get it too seriously

00:49.680 --> 00:55.680
So most people get this one there children exactly and what makes you very uncomfortable when you get chicken pox as you said

00:55.760 --> 01:01.600
It's these little red dots they itch just like mosquito bites, but you can't scratch because if you do

01:02.240 --> 01:08.000
Then you get your skin gets like marked right you have like things ever for it like scars

01:08.640 --> 01:13.280
So it's best not to scratch and that's what we're gonna talk about today

01:13.360 --> 01:19.520
Somebody has the chicken pox so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and then we'll be right back

01:26.560 --> 01:30.080
What's wrong with you? Why are you scratching so much?

01:30.720 --> 01:37.680
I feel itchy I can't stay anymore. I think I may be coming down with something. I feel like headed in leak

01:38.400 --> 01:40.400
Let me have a look

01:40.400 --> 01:42.400
Whoa get away from me

01:42.400 --> 01:45.360
What's wrong? I think you have chicken pox

01:46.000 --> 01:49.120
You're contagious get away. Don't break it on me

01:49.360 --> 01:55.200
Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy. We can't be sure and die see a doctor well in the meantime

01:55.200 --> 02:01.440
You're a biohazard. I didn't get it when I was a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult

02:01.840 --> 02:07.520
Are you serious you always bloat things out of proportion in any case? I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath

02:08.080 --> 02:10.080
you

02:13.440 --> 02:17.280
All right, we're back so I think this kid does have the chicken pox

02:17.600 --> 02:22.800
Definitely and uh well he's got a funny solution for it, but before we get there

02:22.800 --> 02:28.560
We've got a lot of great medical words. It's not just basic body words for you and today's language take away

02:30.160 --> 02:32.160
Language take away

02:32.720 --> 02:34.560
All right, so let's start with our first word

02:35.760 --> 02:44.800
He mentioned that he felt itchy. I feel itchy itchy so okay. This is often confused even among children who are native speakers of English

02:45.040 --> 02:50.800
There are two words to itch and to scratch, but this person is itchy so it means that you're skin

02:51.360 --> 02:57.120
You want to scratch it. It's it's maybe uncomfortable like a mosquito bite is itchy

02:57.680 --> 03:05.440
Okay, so itchy would be the adjective right to the noun and itch so if you have an itch you feel itchy

03:06.800 --> 03:08.800
Exactly, so and that's when you scratch

03:09.760 --> 03:15.680
All right, so hopefully not he feels itchy and he also felt a little bit light headed

03:16.240 --> 03:22.000
Okay, so you know the word head, you know the word light so here we have a person who feels light had it

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
It means that you kind of feel a little bit strange and your head is a little bit

03:28.560 --> 03:33.440
What's a good word of describe it? Yeah, almost dizzy or faint right so

03:33.760 --> 03:39.040
Usually feel a little bit weak. You don't really feel very well your your head is light headed

03:39.040 --> 03:43.440
The complete opposite of having a headache, right? Exactly. Okay, and

03:43.920 --> 03:49.680
Well then the girl got scared and she said get away you are contagious. Oh gosh

03:49.680 --> 03:55.360
Now this is a dangerous one someone who is contagious can pass their illness to someone else

03:55.920 --> 03:59.840
So for example the flu is very contagious and if I have the flu

04:00.400 --> 04:07.680
Marco doesn't want me to you know come over and touch all this stuff and sneeze and cough into his food right

04:08.320 --> 04:12.800
Exactly, so that's contagious. It's an adjective and that means that you easily

04:13.360 --> 04:15.360
Pass your illness to another person

04:15.360 --> 04:21.120
Exactly. All right, so why don't we take a look at a couple of different examples using this word contagious

04:22.640 --> 04:24.640
Example one

04:25.520 --> 04:28.720
Don't get near me chickenpox are very contagious

04:30.240 --> 04:32.240
Example two

04:32.880 --> 04:35.760
The sickness that is going around the office is very contagious

04:37.760 --> 04:39.760
Example three

04:40.480 --> 04:42.800
H1n1 flu is very contagious

04:44.960 --> 04:50.480
All right, so you want to avoid contagious people but you might also want to avoid people who have this next word

04:50.480 --> 04:56.720
It's called a rash a rash exactly so why do you want to avoid people who have a rash?

04:56.960 --> 04:58.720
They might have the contagious rash

04:59.200 --> 05:03.680
Who knows but you can get a rash for a number of different reasons a rash is just

05:04.000 --> 05:06.880
Basically a part of your skin that becomes

05:07.840 --> 05:10.960
Irritated or uncomfortable and sometimes it turns red or pink

05:11.280 --> 05:16.320
Exactly, so as you said it happens for different reasons sometimes you may be have

05:16.880 --> 05:22.000
Bad seafood and your skin and you have you start to have rash his all over your body

05:22.320 --> 05:25.600
Other times you can touch some plants that are dangerous like

05:26.240 --> 05:33.280
Poison ivy or poison oak and then you get a big rash and are last word for today's a little bit dramatic

05:33.840 --> 05:40.480
She called him a bio hazard bio hazard well, let's take a take a look at these words individually

05:40.800 --> 05:45.200
The first word bio comes from the word biology so that's something that is life

05:45.760 --> 05:50.320
An animal plant or person and hazard is something that is dangerous

05:50.640 --> 05:55.520
So bio hazard is a well something that's alive. That's dangerous

05:56.160 --> 06:00.640
Right or that's dangerous towards a living person right or organism for example

06:00.640 --> 06:05.760
You don't want to be near an area that has a lot of radiation. It's a bio hazard

06:06.000 --> 06:08.720
exactly or some of these diseases like

06:09.840 --> 06:15.840
Ebola virus these are very dangerous towards living things and so bio hazard is the name point

06:15.920 --> 06:22.720
Exactly and usually it's there's a symbol a very clear symbol that kind of looks like a triangle and it's red and

06:23.200 --> 06:28.800
Even in movies it's appeared right. I think in that movie yellow it's red or yellow. Yeah, sometimes

06:29.920 --> 06:33.920
All right, so bio hazard. I think we've taken a look at a lot of words

06:34.400 --> 06:40.080
So why don't we listen to this dialogue again? Let's slow it down a little bit see if we can understand a little bit more

06:45.920 --> 06:54.800
What's wrong with you? Why are you scratching so much? I feel itchy. I can't stand it anymore

06:55.360 --> 07:00.160
I think I may be coming down with something. I feel like headed in a week

07:01.200 --> 07:07.200
Let me have a look whoa get away from me. What's wrong?

07:08.480 --> 07:15.120
I think you have the chickenpox your contagious get away. Don't breathe on me

07:15.920 --> 07:25.040
It's just a rash or an allergy we can't be sure until I see a doctor well in the meantime you are a bio hazard

07:25.600 --> 07:31.440
I didn't get it when I was a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult

07:32.000 --> 07:39.280
Are you serious? You always blow things out of proportion in any case. I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath

07:39.840 --> 07:41.840
you

07:42.240 --> 07:50.320
All right, we're back. So now why don't we take a look at fluency builder and start taking a look at all these phrases

07:51.840 --> 07:54.640
Fluency builder well the first one is

07:55.680 --> 08:04.640
Something that we often say when we're starting to feel ill this phrases coming down with so I could say I think I'm coming down with a

08:04.720 --> 08:12.320
Colt for example, so basically you say I'm coming down with something so a cold or I think I'm coming down with the flu

08:12.880 --> 08:15.280
So you're saying that I think I'm getting ill

08:16.080 --> 08:19.600
Exactly, it means I'm just starting to feel sick and so

08:20.320 --> 08:25.040
You could say I've had a cold for a week you wouldn't use the phrase I'm coming down with in that situation

08:25.040 --> 08:29.760
You don't use it when you're starting to feel sick very good. So you could ask your boss

08:30.240 --> 08:32.800
I think I'm coming down with the flu. Can I go home early?

08:34.080 --> 08:37.600
Right and I think this is a very useful phrase. It's very

08:38.400 --> 08:42.080
Natural to say so why don't we listen to a couple of other examples

08:43.120 --> 08:45.120
Example one

08:45.680 --> 08:49.040
Honey really take my temperature. I think I'm coming down with something

08:51.040 --> 08:55.120
Example two you must be coming down with a cold

08:57.120 --> 08:59.120
Example three

09:00.720 --> 09:02.720
Tommy came down with a flu

09:04.800 --> 09:08.640
All right, so coming down with coming down with the flu coming down with a cough

09:09.280 --> 09:11.760
etc. All right, what's our next phrase?

09:11.760 --> 09:15.040
Well, this one's great. It's a it's a filler phrase. So

09:16.000 --> 09:18.560
In the meantime in the meantime

09:19.120 --> 09:22.160
So it could I could say all right, I'm gonna go cook dinner

09:23.280 --> 09:28.640
In the meantime Marco, can you please clear the table? Okay, so while you are

09:29.280 --> 09:34.400
Cooking dinner, I am doing something else. I'm cleaning the table. So two things happening at the same time

09:34.400 --> 09:37.680
In the meantime very good. So it's a filler you say

09:37.680 --> 09:42.640
Because usually it follows another phrase. So I'm gonna be doing this report for a while in the meantime

09:42.640 --> 09:48.320
Can you just can you just wait here on the sofa please? Okay very good. So in the meantime

09:48.320 --> 09:55.520
So you're connecting two different actions two different ideas exactly very good in the meantime and what about our last phrase?

09:56.480 --> 10:01.440
All right, there are some people who really like to do this and I might be one of them

10:02.000 --> 10:11.600
It's called it to blow things out of proportion. All right, and you're gonna hear this phrase a lot with native English speakers and so to blow things out of proportion

10:12.080 --> 10:14.080
Well, pretty much means that your

10:15.520 --> 10:21.440
Exaggerating or you're making a really big deal out of something that's not very

10:21.760 --> 10:28.480
Serious so for example, if you come over to my house and you break a glass and I start freaking out and yelling at you because you broke my glass

10:28.480 --> 10:33.200
I say Marco you're blowing things out of proportion. I'll just buy you a new one. It's not that serious

10:33.200 --> 10:38.400
All right, so don't exaggerate, right? Right, so often times you feel like this with with

10:39.280 --> 10:46.240
With siblings spouses or bosses who react very seriously, so you can say hey stop

10:46.240 --> 10:51.280
Stop yelling like you're growing you're blowing things out of proportion. This is not a really big deal

10:51.280 --> 10:59.760
Exactly, all right, so um blowing things out of proportion. Let's not do that, but let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll be back

11:07.760 --> 11:14.320
What's wrong with you? Why are you scratching so much? I feel richy. I can't stare anymore

11:14.640 --> 11:18.160
I think I may be coming down with something. I feel like headed in leak

11:18.800 --> 11:20.800
Let me have a look

11:20.800 --> 11:24.080
Whoa get away from me. What's wrong? I

11:24.320 --> 11:29.440
Think you have chicken packs. You're contagious get away. Don't break it on me

11:30.000 --> 11:35.680
Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy. We can't be sure and die. See a doctor well in the meantime

11:35.680 --> 11:41.920
You're a biohazard. I didn't get it when I was a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult

11:42.400 --> 11:49.040
Are you serious? You always blow things out of proportion. In any case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath. Ew

11:55.920 --> 12:03.280
All right, so Catherine have you ever had the chickenpox? I did. I have very very clear memories of when I was a child

12:03.280 --> 12:10.240
And I had the chickenpox because I believe it was Thanksgiving and I was about four or five years old and

12:10.320 --> 12:17.440
I couldn't I didn't have an appetite so I was not hungry and I like to do was itch and drink and so I still have

12:17.440 --> 12:23.440
Little scars like you mentioned from where I couldn't stop myself from scratching my my little marks right

12:23.440 --> 12:29.680
And well, why does this little boy said that he's going to go take a oatmeal bath and oatmeal bath okay?

12:29.680 --> 12:37.040
Well, this is one of the home remedies one of the home cures for the itchiness all right

12:37.120 --> 12:44.160
So it doesn't make your chickenpox go away, but it does make your skin feel better because it's very calming and smooth

12:44.720 --> 12:52.080
So you can have some creams or some lotions, but other other people like to take an oatmeal bath right so then you're not itching anymore

12:52.080 --> 12:54.960
Right, but it's gross because you're sitting in an oatmeal

12:55.760 --> 12:59.920
It is kind of gross. Have you had the chickenpox? I did I didn't know

13:00.400 --> 13:04.160
But because I couldn't remember so I actually my brother had it recently

13:04.160 --> 13:09.120
So I was afraid that I didn't get it, but call my mom she said I got it so I'm good. You're safe

13:09.120 --> 13:12.720
Yeah, so that's the thing right you can only get it once so once you get it

13:12.720 --> 13:14.480
You don't you don't have a problem

13:14.480 --> 13:21.920
Well, we're curious to know have you had the chickenpox and if you did was it was it really itchy or were you a lucky one and it wasn't so bad

13:21.920 --> 13:27.280
So let us know on our website EnglishPod.com right and if you ever had any other common childhood

13:27.760 --> 13:31.920
illnesses like the mumps or the measles right you can also tell us about that

13:32.320 --> 13:35.440
So we'll see you guys there and until next time bye. Bye. Bye
