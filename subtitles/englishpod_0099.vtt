00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello English learners. Welcome back to English pod. My name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
And I'm Erica. And today we're going to go back to the movies, but this time we're going to do it a little bit different.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
That's right. We're going to be listening as two movie critics offer their opinion on the latest release.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
All right. So we're going to be learning how to criticize or give your opinions about something.

00:24.000 --> 00:36.000
That's right. And here we're talking movies, but a lot of this language can be used to offer your criticism or ideas on literature or our artistic pursuits.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
Okay. So before we listen to this dialogue for the first time, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
Well, we're going to look at one word here that we will hear in the dialogue and it is aerodite.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Area-dite. Okay. So this word area-dite. Some people pronounce it aerodite.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
That's true. And basically it's an adjective describing someone who has a lot of knowledge about a subject.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Okay. So an area-dite in engineering.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes. Or an area-dite professor.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Okay. Very good. So that's the word that we're going to preview today.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
And now let's listen to our dialogue and find out what movie they are criticizing.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
Welcome back movie lovers to another premiere movie review.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
My name is Richard Clark and I am joined today by the very aerodite David Watson.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Thank you, Dick. Today we're going to talk about the movie Lion King.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Tell me what is your impression of this film?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, I think this film is simply a fable.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
The picked thing man's eternal greed for power. And in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Even despite the accusations of plagiarism of traditional folk tales from other countries,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
the music score was amazing. The animation was very well done and the story was simply enchanting.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Well, I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
The film lacks certain originality. It lacked heart.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
How? Come on, Dave. It's a g-rated movie. It's for the kids.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
It's not a thriller.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes, for example,

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
when Mufasa dies or the dark grim portrayal of scar.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Even so, the film is linear. Mufasa dies.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Simba runs away thinking it's his fault.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Falson love and returns to retake what's rightfully his.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
It's just too cliche.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
How can it be cliche? It's a fable.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
It's telling a time-honored story. The movie makes a point of how the hunger of power

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
leads to corruption and teaches children of the value of respect, life and love.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
You have always been so soft, Dick.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Open your heart, Dave. Don't shut it down.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Anyway, that's all for today folks.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Join us next time as we talk about how to lose a guy in 10 days.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm sure you'll love that one, Dick.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
All right, so the Lion King, one of my all-time favorites.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
A very good movie and, well, mixed feelings about it, right?

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Some people think it's good, other people think it's not that good.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm in the good camp, as you know.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
But anyway, there's tons of really useful and quite difficult language here.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
So why don't we look at that now in language takeaway?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Language takeaway.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
All right, on language takeaway today, we have five words

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
and we can start with the first one.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
So the first critic said that this was a movie,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
depicting man's eternal greed for power.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Depicting two depicting.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
All right, so this word depicked.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It sounds a little bit strange.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
So before we explain it, let's take a look at some examples.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Example one.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
I don't really like the way that novel depicted the role of women in society.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
It was pretty sexist.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Example two.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
The film depicts the realities of war very accurately.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Example three.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
So this image here is depicting some of the most well-known scene

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
from Australian history.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
All right, so depicting.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
I can basically understand that this means to show something.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
Now we can notice that the word depicked has this short little word

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
picked in there that sounds like picture.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
And when we think about depicting, we're often thinking about

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
in a picture or in a book or in a painting.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
So in this case, the story is depicted in a movie, right?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
That's right.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
So you can see it.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
It's a picture, basically.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Exactly.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
All right, very good.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
So to depict.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Well, moving on, the critic also talked about the grim portrayal

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
of the villain of the movie Scar.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
That's right.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So grim portrayal.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
A grim portrayal.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Okay, let's look at the word grim first.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
When something is grim, it's really unpleasant or uncomfortable

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
or even shocking to think about.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay, so something that is grim.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Now, what about portrayal?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Really close to depict.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
A portrayal is something that shows or describes something,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
especially like in a book or in a picture or in a play.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Okay, so a portrayal.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I guess we can relate it again to a portrait.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
That's right.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
All right, so portrayal.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Now, we can also use this as a verb to portray.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
So this movie portrays man's eternal greed.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Okay, so we can use this as a noun or as a verb.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
That's right.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
So moving on with our third word today,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
we have an enchanting movie.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
That's right.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
The story was simply enchanting.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Okay, so if something is enchanting,

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
it's really attractive and beautiful and interesting

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
and it holds your attention.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Okay, it holds your attention.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
So it's something very nice.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Something that is enchanting has to be nice.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
That's right.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And it has this sense of magic around it.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Okay, very good.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
So an enchanting moment.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Or an enchanting woman.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Okay, and now what about our next word?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
It's a very, and what about our next word?

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
It's French, actually, but we use it in English.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
That's right.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
So the critics had that this story was cliché.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
cliché.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
cliché.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Okay, so we hear this all the time.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
What is a cliché?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, basically a cliché is a phrase or an idea

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
that is used so often that it loses its meaning or importance or interest.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Okay, so can you give us some examples of a cliché moment

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
or maybe a phrase that's cliché?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Well, how about this one?

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
When you're breaking up with your boyfriend and you say, honey, it's not you.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
It's me.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Okay, that's cliché.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
It's typical.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah, or maybe a cliché portrayal of a French man would be a guy

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
writing a bike with a baguette smoking a cigarette and with a beret on his head.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Okay, that's a cliché portrayal.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Very good.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
So it's common.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
It's even to a certain point a little bit stereotypical.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
That's right.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
All right.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
And what about our last word?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Well, they describe this story as a fable.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Fable.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
A fable.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay, so when we were small, we all read fables.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
That's right.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
They are stories about animals that are used to teach people lesson.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Okay, so a fable teaches you a lesson.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
I think the most famous one is the one of the tortoise and the hair, right?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, and another good one would be the three little pigs.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay, that's also a fable.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
We've looked at these five great words.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
And now it's time for us to move on to putting it together.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Let's get together.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
Okay, here we're going to look at some phrases that you can use in a bunch of different ways

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
to help you criticize or give your opinion about a piece of art, like a movie or a book or whatever.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Okay, so let's start right away with our first word.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
So the film critic asked, what is your impression of this film?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
What's your impression of?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
What's your impression of something, right?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
That's right.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
All right, so before we get into explaining in pression, let's listen to some more examples.

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
Example one, I don't know where, but I have the impression that we have met before.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Example two.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
I get the impression that he's a very organized person.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Example three.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Somehow Jim got the impression that I was gay to determine that.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
Okay, so I can see that this means basically what's your opinion or how do you feel about something?

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Okay, so you can have an impression of something or of someone.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yep.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
All right.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
And what about the next word?

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
Well, the critic Richard Clark said that it was a really enjoyable film even despite the accusations of

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
plagiarism.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
Okay, so now we have an interesting phrase here, the accusations of plagiarism.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Accusations of plagiarism.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Okay, so accusations is now, right?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Right, it's the action of accusing.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Okay, of blaming somebody.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yep.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
All right, and what about plagiarism?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
This is an academic term.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
If you plagiarize, you copy someone's work and take credit for it.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
Okay, so if I copy somebody's book and I say, I wrote it, then that's plagiarism.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
That's pretty bad.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
So accusations of plagiarism.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Now we can use this phrase accusations of something in a bunch of different ways.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
So Marco, let's have an example.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
All right, so for example, we can say he was colliered of all accusations of tax evasion.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Okay, he denied accusations of cheating on his wife.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
All right, very good.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
So accusations.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
And now moving on to the final part of putting it together, we have this word, Lacks.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
The film lacks a certain originality.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Okay, so the film lacks a certain originality.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
What does he mean by that?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It doesn't have enough of.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Okay, so if you are lacking something, you don't have enough of it.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Or you don't have it at all.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
All right, so can you give us some more examples of how we can use Lack?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Okay, the same way it's used in the dialogue.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Our team lacks the appropriate talent to complete this project.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
Okay, or I can say our school lacks infrastructure for so many students.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
Or we can also say infrastructure is lacking at our school.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Okay, so you can use it in those two ways, right?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
You can use it as a gerund or as a verb.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
That's right.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Okay, lots of great language here.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
And why don't we hear it one more time in context with the dialogue?

10:56.000 --> 11:07.000
Welcome back, movie lovers to another premiere movie review.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
My name is Richard Clark, and I am joined today by the very aeradite David Watson.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Thank you, Dick.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Today we're going to talk about the movie Lion King.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Tell me, what is your impression of this film?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Well, I think this film is simply a fable.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
The picked thing man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
Even despite the accusations of plagiarism of traditional folktales from other countries,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
the music score was amazing.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
The animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
But I think otherwise, even though the animation was technically strong,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
the film lacks certain originality.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
It lacked heart, and I would dare to say, it was too predictable.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
How?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Come on, Dave.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
It's a g-rated movie.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
It's for the kids.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
It's not a thriller.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, that's just it.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes, for example,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
when Mufasa dies, or the dark grim portrayal of scar.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Even so, the film is linear.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Mufasa dies.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Simba runs away thinking it's his fault.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Falson love and returns to retake what's rightfully his.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
It's just too cliche.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
How can it be cliche?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
It's a fable.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
It's telling a time-honored story.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
The movie makes a point of how the hunger of power leads to corruption,

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
and teaches children of the value of respect, life and love.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
You have always been so soft, Dick.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Hahahaha.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Open your heart, Dave.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Don't shut it down.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Anyway, that's all for today folks.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Join us next time as we talk about how to lose a guy in 10 days.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I'm sure you love that one, Dick.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Alright, so, a good movie.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
What do you think about the Lion King?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
What do you think about his critique?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Well, I am with Dick on this one.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I think that this is a great film.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
It was one of my favorites, and I've seen it about five billion times.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Really?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Yep.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
You really liked it.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
But I'm not interested in my opinion.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
I want to hear criticisms and film criticisms from our users.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000

or maybe the other one that we mentioned

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
how to lose a guy in 10 days.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Personally, not so fond of that one,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
but looking forward to hearing from our users.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
