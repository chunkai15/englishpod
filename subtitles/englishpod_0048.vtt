00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
Hello English learners, welcome back to English pot. My name is Marco.

00:04.640 --> 00:05.760
I'm Erica.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.440
And today we're at a party.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.040
Yeah, this is a great exciting fun energetic lesson.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.440
We're at the biggest party in the world. Carnival in Rio.

00:15.440 --> 00:19.040
Okay, so Rio, this is the name of a city, right?

00:19.040 --> 00:22.640
Yeah, this is a city in Brazil called Rio de Janeiro.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.480
So Rio de Janeiro.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.800
Yeah, different pronunciation.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.080
Yeah, it sounds a lot more.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.040
I don't know.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.120
I've been ticked in mine.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.680
So we sometimes refer to it as Rio just to make it shorter.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.720
Yeah, I think that's actually the most common way it's referred to in Rio.

00:38.720 --> 00:39.200
Yeah, Rio.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.920
It's just like if you would say Los Angeles, you would say a lay.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.040
Yeah, or yeah, if you're talking about quality on poor, you might say KL.

00:45.040 --> 00:45.600
Yeah.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.240
Same idea.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.840
Okay, so we have some words that we're going to preview before we listen to our dialogue.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.680
So let's start with vocabulary preview.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.400
Very vocabulary preview.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.680
Okay, well, vocabulary preview.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.640
We have one word, sambadrome.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.840
sambadrome.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.640
sambadrome.

01:00.640 --> 01:01.440
sambadrome.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.600
This is actually a building.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.120
So it's a proper now, not a common now, right?

01:07.120 --> 01:08.560
No, it's not really a common now.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.320
It's a proper noun, but it is a building.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.720
And what happens in this building?

01:12.720 --> 01:19.120
Basically, it's very similar to a stadium, but each end isn't closed off.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.480
So you have stands on one side, and stands on the other,

01:22.480 --> 01:24.480
and you have like a little street in the middle.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.120
Okay.

01:25.120 --> 01:29.840
So you can sit down, and you can watch people parade or walk by,

01:29.840 --> 01:31.760
and you can see the dancers and everything.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.000
And so what is it used for?

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
The sambadrome is used so that the sambas schools can present their dances

01:40.000 --> 01:44.400
and their dancers and their costumes to judges and all the people that want to watch

01:44.400 --> 01:46.160
them dance sambas.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.120
Okay, so you've been using this word, sambas.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.000
sambas.

01:50.000 --> 01:50.960
What is this?

01:51.040 --> 01:53.600
sambas is a type of dance that Brazil is famous for.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.400
Okay.

01:54.400 --> 02:00.560
It's very fast dance, a lot of hit movements, a lot of, it's very fast,

02:00.560 --> 02:01.840
but it's very, very nice.

02:01.840 --> 02:05.840
And the music is based with many different types of tropical instruments.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.520
So it's really, really fun.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.720
Can you sambas?

02:08.720 --> 02:11.440
I can sambas a little bit.

02:11.440 --> 02:12.960
It's kind of hard.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.320
It's trickier than when it seems.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.480
Okay, well, we're actually going to hear some sambas music in the dialogue, right?

02:18.480 --> 02:22.160
Exactly, we're going to hear some sambas that is actually used during carnival.

02:22.160 --> 02:27.200
So, okay, so let's go to Rio now and listen to some sambas.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.720
I can't believe we're here.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.480
Kind of a win Rio, seriously.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.040
This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.640
Can we believe it?

02:42.640 --> 02:45.280
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.160
I know!

02:46.160 --> 02:48.800
We're still lucky we found tickets for the sambadrum.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.800
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.640
Look, it's starting.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.640
Wow, this is amazing.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.960
Look at how many dancers there are on.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.000
Oh my gosh, the costumes are so colorful.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.360
This is so cool.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.400
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest

03:04.400 --> 03:06.880
and most prestigious sambas schools in Rio.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.720
No kidding, look at them.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.920
They're amazing.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.400
Look at that girl on top of that float.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
She must be the carnival queen.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.840
We're over there, so I can get a picture of her.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.240
Okay, hurry up, take the picture.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.880
Oh, they look like a Jane too.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.880
Oh, really, no, I can't.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.280
Really, I don't know how to dance.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.000
Honey, I'll see you later.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.560
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.720
Woo!

03:44.400 --> 03:47.600
All right, what a lucky guy he got asked out to dance

03:47.600 --> 03:50.560
by a beautiful Brazilian sambadancer.

03:50.560 --> 03:50.960
I know.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.160
I don't think his wife was very happy though.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.520
Well, we've got some language about carnival in Rio, right?

03:57.520 --> 03:58.240
Exactly.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.560
So let's look at that now with language takeaway.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.600
Language takeaway.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.760
All right, our first word on language takeaway today.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.880
Ticket scalper.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.080
Ticket scalper.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.440
Ticket scalper.

04:11.440 --> 04:12.400
Ticket scalper.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.040
This is actually a job title, I think.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.320
Maybe not a totally legal job title.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.280
Exactly.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.960
So what does a ticket scalper do?

04:21.680 --> 04:26.160
Basically, this person will sell tickets at a higher price

04:26.160 --> 04:27.600
to people who don't have tickets.

04:27.760 --> 04:32.160
Okay, so he buys like 100 tickets and goes and stands

04:32.160 --> 04:36.080
outside of the sambadrome or the stadium.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.040
Any, any sells them for twice the price, right?

04:39.040 --> 04:39.920
Yeah, exactly.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.120
Yeah, that's a tickets scalper.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.640
Actually, they come in handy sometimes because you want to go to a concert

04:44.640 --> 04:46.400
or something and you don't have tickets,

04:46.400 --> 04:47.920
you gotta turn to them, right?

04:47.920 --> 04:48.640
Right?

04:48.640 --> 04:51.600
Okay, our next word, prestigious.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.800
prestigious.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.840
prestigious.

04:53.840 --> 04:54.800
prestigious.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.360
Now, this is a very nice word, prestigious.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.440
Before we explain anything, let's listen to some examples.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.440
Example one.

05:05.120 --> 05:09.440
Harvard University is one of the most prestigious schools in North America.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.560
Example two.

05:15.120 --> 05:18.160
The Academy Award is the most prestigious prize

05:18.160 --> 05:20.240
and actor can get in the film industry.

05:20.640 --> 05:25.280
Example three.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.240
He worked really hard and now he is a very prestigious heart surgeon.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.880
I can see that when something is prestigious, it's really well respected, right?

05:38.880 --> 05:41.120
It's well known, well respected.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.760
And you can, and if you are part of this thing,

05:43.760 --> 05:45.360
you can feel a sense of pride.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.560
Right, prestige.

05:47.520 --> 05:54.160
Okay, now let's take a look at our last word, float, float, float, float.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.480
Now this doesn't mean like to float in water, right?

05:56.480 --> 05:58.480
No, this is a now, not a verb.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.240
It's kind of hard to describe, actually.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.280
Yeah, it's hard to describe.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.440
A float is something that you commonly see in parades.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.240
Right.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.440
So it would be like a car, but you can't really see the car.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.680
No, because it's covered with decoration.

06:11.680 --> 06:17.120
But big decorations, and it's made to look like an artificial island.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.120
Yeah, or a tree, maybe.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.880
So you have people standing on there and dancing or waving.

06:22.880 --> 06:23.520
Yeah.

06:23.520 --> 06:28.720
Okay, we'll definitely post a picture of a float on our comment section,

06:28.720 --> 06:30.480
so you can see what a float looks like.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.040
Right.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.040
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue again.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.240
We're going to slow it down a little bit, so you can understand all of these words.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.280
We've just talked about.

06:42.080 --> 06:46.480
I can't believe we're here.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.560
Carnival in Rio, seriously.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.640
This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.400
Can you believe it?

06:57.040 --> 07:00.000
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.080
I know.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.360
We're so lucky that we found tickets for the Somodrome.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.000
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.640
Look, it's starting.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.000
Wow, this is amazing.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.480
Look at how many dancers there are.

07:17.200 --> 07:21.520
Oh my gosh, the costumes are so colorful.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.920
This is so cool.

07:24.800 --> 07:30.480
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious

07:30.480 --> 07:31.920
Somod schools in Rio.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.880
No kidding, look at them.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.280
They're amazing.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.080
Look at that girl on top of that float.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.880
She must be the carnival queen.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.560
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.160
Okay, hurry up, take the picture.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.560
Oh, really? No, I can't. No, really.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.000
I don't know how to dance.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.920
Honey, I'll see you later.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.000
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.400
All right, we're back. So now I think we should take a look at some of the phrases.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.480
Yeah, let's go to fluency builder.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.120
All right.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.520
fluency builder.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.520
So we have this phrase once in a lifetime.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.880
Once in a lifetime.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.080
Once in a lifetime.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.520
Once in a lifetime.

08:27.520 --> 08:31.360
So this is an expression you would use to say that it doesn't happen very often.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.360
Yeah, it's a really special event.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.160
So like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.920
Or a once in a lifetime chance.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.360
Okay, yeah.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.960
Once in a lifetime.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.800
Let's look at our next phrase.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.000
Good thing.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.280
Good thing.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.160
Good thing.

08:46.160 --> 08:46.960
Good thing.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.760
So we have some examples for good thing.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.840
Why don't we listen to them and then we'll come back.

08:52.960 --> 08:53.920
Example one.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.200
Good thing I studied for my exam.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.080
It was really hard.

09:04.000 --> 09:04.720
Example two.

09:05.680 --> 09:10.320
It's a good thing I brought my umbrella.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.680
It rained the whole day.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.040
Example three.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.880
It's a good thing that I bought in my house before the prices went up.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.880
Good thing I had money in my wallet.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.880
You're happy you had money in your wallet.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.960
If you could also maybe use it as a negative, right?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.960
Like, good thing I didn't go.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.160
Right.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.120
I'm happy I didn't go because it was terrible.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.320
Okay, good thing.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.120
Yep.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.280
All right, now let's take a look at our last word.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.160
No kidding.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.280
No kidding.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.080
No kidding.

09:48.080 --> 09:48.800
No kidding.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.080
Okay, so many of you probably already know this word,

09:52.080 --> 09:52.880
kidding, right?

09:52.880 --> 09:54.000
Yeah, I mean, joking.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.440
Yeah, I'm joking, just kidding.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.480
Yeah, okay.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.240
But if I would say, no kidding.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.480
You're saying like, yeah, I totally agree with you.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.760
Right, I agree with you.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.200
I know you are.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.160
I know you're being serious.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.120
I know you're being serious.

10:07.120 --> 10:07.840
I know it's true.

10:07.840 --> 10:08.320
Yeah.

10:08.320 --> 10:11.040
So I could say, wow, this restaurant is really expensive.

10:11.040 --> 10:11.840
No kidding.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.680
Yeah, so you would agree is like, yeah, for real.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.480
Yep.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.440
All right.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.400
So this term, no kidding, is slang, right?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.000
It's a little bit informal, yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:20.160
Yeah.

10:20.160 --> 10:20.320
Yeah.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.360
Okay.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.640
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again for the third time,

10:24.640 --> 10:26.960
and then we'll come back and talk about Brazil.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.160
I can't believe we're here.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.600
Kind of a win Rio, seriously.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.320
This is like a R1Cino lifetime opportunity.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.760
Can we believe it?

10:43.760 --> 10:46.480
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.360
I know.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.920
We're so lucky we found tickets for the Samba drum.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.920
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.760
Look, it's starting.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.760
Wow, this is amazing.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.080
Look at how many dancers there are.

10:58.080 --> 11:01.200
Oh my gosh, the costumes are so colorful.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.560
This is so cool.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.400
It says here that the school that is dancing now

11:04.400 --> 11:08.080
is one of the oldest and most prestigious Samba schools in Rio.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.120
No kidding.

11:09.120 --> 11:09.920
Look at them.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.120
They're amazing.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.600
Look at that girl on top of that float.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.280
She must be the carnival queen over there,

11:17.280 --> 11:18.960
so I can get a picture of her.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.720
Okay, hurry up.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.560
Take the picture.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.880
Oh, they look like a Jane too.

11:24.880 --> 11:25.440
Oh, really?

11:25.440 --> 11:26.880
No, I can't.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.600
Really?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.840
I don't know how to dance.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.840
Honey, I'll see you later.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.760
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.040
All right, Marco, so carnival.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.080
It's a Brazilian celebration, right?

11:50.080 --> 11:52.880
It's a, it's very popular in all Latin America.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.440
Oh, really?

11:53.440 --> 11:56.240
Yeah, but Brazilian carnival is very, very special.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.760
Okay, so what are they celebrating?

11:58.400 --> 12:00.480
So basically, it's the beginning of Lent,

12:00.480 --> 12:04.960
which is this period of time in the Catholic religion right before Easter.

12:04.960 --> 12:05.600
Right.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.360
But carnival in Brazil is very special because of all the dancing

12:09.360 --> 12:12.080
and all of this and costumes and everything.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.840
Yeah, well, from the dialogue, it sounds really wild and crazy.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.120
So what happens?

12:17.120 --> 12:19.200
Well, it definitely is really amazing.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.720
And it's just basically a lot of Samba music and partying.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.680
And it's really nice and especially to be able to see something

12:25.680 --> 12:29.200
so spectacular, it's like hundreds and thousands of dancers in the Samba

12:29.200 --> 12:34.480
drum and they're parading down in their costumes and in floats.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.440
So it's a very, very, it's a very special event.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.440
All right, so it sounds like a lot of fun.

12:39.440 --> 12:40.480
Yeah.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.000
I want to hear from our listeners.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.080
Yeah, for sure, we have a lot of listeners from Brazil.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.720
And carnival is not only celebrating Rio.

12:46.720 --> 12:50.240
It's also in São Paulo, in Bernambuco, in Bahia.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.640
And it's a little bit different in each place, so

12:52.640 --> 12:54.320
so it's not just a thing of Rio.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.600
It's just more popular there.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.440
Is there a Samba drum in each city?

12:57.440 --> 12:59.360
Yeah, there is a Samba drum in São Paulo, yeah.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.240
Oh, cool.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.760
Yeah, let us know if you've ever been to carnival or how you

13:03.760 --> 13:06.000
