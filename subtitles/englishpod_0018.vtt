00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Hello everyone welcome to EnglishPod my name is Marco and I'm Erica and today with

00:06.240 --> 00:11.680
Erica we have a very aggressive lesson for you today. That's true we've got a

00:11.680 --> 00:17.760
revolutionary lesson. Yes today at EnglishPod we're protesting so Erica why don't you

00:17.760 --> 00:25.520
tell us what a protest is? Well when you protest something you go into the streets and show

00:25.600 --> 00:32.800
your disagreement. Right and you yell and you have signs and everyone's just protesting.

00:32.800 --> 00:39.040
And the news comes and if it's not clear now it'll be clear after the dialogue I'm sure.

00:39.040 --> 00:44.000
Definitely definitely so why don't we start with our vocabulary preview.

00:44.560 --> 00:50.560
The vocabulary preview. We have two words in our vocabulary preview today the first is

00:50.560 --> 00:57.520
bankrupt. Bankrupt. Bankrupt. Bankrupt. Bankrupt. Bankrupt. So if a company goes bankrupt what happens?

00:57.920 --> 01:03.120
It means the company doesn't have any more money. So it can't pay salaries. It can't pay any.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.880
It's bills yeah so basically if it's bankrupt it's probably going to close. Exactly.

01:08.880 --> 01:17.120
Okay our second word today is bail out bail out. bail out. bail out. P-A-I-L bail out.

01:17.200 --> 01:22.800
So bail out is when the government gives money to a company that is about to go bankrupt.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.440
That's true it's emergency money that will help save the company. Well these two words are

01:27.440 --> 01:37.120
taken directly from our dialogue and in today's dialogue we're going to bring you live to a newscast.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.520
Right so why don't we just listen to the dialogue?

01:47.600 --> 01:54.960
This is action five news reporter Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington DC

01:54.960 --> 02:00.080
where protests has broken out thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed

02:00.080 --> 02:06.480
bailout of the auto manufacturing industry. Sir Sarah O'Connell tell five news can you tell us

02:06.480 --> 02:12.720
what's happening? Yeah yeah we're here because we feel this is an injustice. The financial

02:13.280 --> 02:18.000
responsibility of big business has to stop. We're here to show the government that we don't

02:18.000 --> 02:23.920
like the way they're spending our tax dollars. Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry?

02:23.920 --> 02:30.320
It's an absolute outrage Sarah the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers

02:30.320 --> 02:36.400
money to the auto industry. These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

02:36.400 --> 02:42.320
I see but many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions

02:43.280 --> 02:47.280
Americans. That may be true and I for what don't want to see anyone lose their job.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.760
But how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars?

02:51.760 --> 02:57.440
And then they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets. This cost hundreds of thousands

02:57.440 --> 03:03.840
of dollars. They're asking for money that is just not right. Good point. This is Sarah O'Connell

03:03.840 --> 03:10.320
reporting live from Washington DC back to Utah.

03:12.560 --> 03:21.360
Wow these people are really angry. I think they're furious. Well I think they have some good

03:21.360 --> 03:26.080
points and we'll talk about that later. But now it's time for language takeaway.

03:27.920 --> 03:34.480
Language takeaway. There was some great language in this dialogue. A lot of language we use to

03:34.480 --> 03:41.440
express our anger. Right and one of those words and the first one for language takeaway is

03:42.160 --> 03:51.520
injustice. injustice. And injustice. So an injustice is something that isn't fair.

03:51.520 --> 03:57.200
It's totally unfair. It's unfair. Yeah. This isn't injustice. Let's look at our second word

03:57.760 --> 04:06.080
outrage. outrage. Outrage. And outrage. So Erica why don't you give us an example on how you would use

04:06.160 --> 04:14.880
outrage. There's no more coffee. This is an outrage. Yeah that's an outrage. Okay. Let's go to our next

04:14.880 --> 04:21.920
word now. Breakout. Breakout. Breakout. Breakout. Breakout. Breakout. So we have some great examples

04:21.920 --> 04:32.480
on how we use breakout. So let's listen. Example one. War is broken out in Antarctica as countries of

04:32.480 --> 04:44.960
the world fight for control of the icy continent. Example two. Officers are warning that

04:44.960 --> 04:59.600
fighting could break out in the border regions. Example three. A forest fire broke out last night.

05:02.720 --> 05:10.480
Well this is a wonderful phrasal verb that means to begin suddenly. Okay so I think that's pretty

05:10.480 --> 05:18.640
clear. Yeah. Breakout. Let's go to our next word now. Mismanaged. Mismanaged. Mismanaged.

05:18.640 --> 05:25.280
So when something is mismanaged it's not managed properly. Managed poorly, right? Yeah.

05:25.360 --> 05:33.200
Our final word today is have the nerve tube. Have the nerve tube. Have the nerve tube.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.080
I think this one also is a little bit difficult to understand. Yeah but we have some great examples

05:38.080 --> 05:42.400
prepared for you. So let's listen to them. Example one.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.480
I've been in love with you since the third grade but I didn't have the left to tell you.

05:50.480 --> 06:04.640
Example two. I don't believe it. You have the nerve to ask me from my name when you know I've

06:04.640 --> 06:19.520
just lost my job. Example three. What? You have the nerve to bring your new girlfriend to visit

06:19.520 --> 06:29.680
my mother. So have the nerve tube is like dare to do something right? Yeah how dare you.

06:29.680 --> 06:34.960
Yeah have the nerve tube. It's like I can't believe you would do that. Yeah I think that's

06:34.960 --> 06:41.200
quite clear. Yeah okay. A lot of great words in our dialogue today and also we have some

06:41.200 --> 06:46.480
really interesting grammar in today's dialogue. Right so today let's look at some

06:46.880 --> 06:57.120
grammar breakdown. Gramma breakdown. In this section grammar breakdown we show you a

06:57.120 --> 07:03.360
particular grammar structure and explain a little bit about how that structure affects meaning.

07:03.360 --> 07:10.000
So it's not really about getting the grammar perfectly right? It's about understanding the meaning.

07:10.880 --> 07:16.080
Right and in today's lesson we saw some really great examples on how we use the present

07:16.160 --> 07:22.640
perfect tense. Let's listen to an example from the dialogue. We're protests has broken out.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.280
We're protests has broken out. See the verb here break out like a protest has broken out

07:31.280 --> 07:39.200
happened in the past right? Right. And it's still going on now. Exactly. So present perfect is used

07:39.200 --> 07:45.040
when we're talking about a event that happened in the past and is continuing on now. Exactly.

07:45.040 --> 07:51.680
Or is continuing to affect now? Exactly. Okay I think that's pretty clear. Yeah but now if you

07:51.680 --> 07:57.280
want to indicate or if you want to demonstrate that the action has finished the event is over

07:58.000 --> 08:07.520
then you would say it like this. A protest broke out. A protest broke out.

08:09.440 --> 08:14.960
This form you see that the protest is over. It happened yesterday already. Right and I think it's

08:15.040 --> 08:22.880
really emphasizing the fact that it is no longer affecting the present moment. Exactly. So remember

08:22.880 --> 08:27.520
the difference between present perfect and simple past. Now if you want to know more about

08:27.520 --> 08:33.520
these tenses present perfect and simple past be sure to go to our website at englishpod.com

08:33.520 --> 08:38.400
in the grammar section you can find some more great examples and a really clear explanation

08:38.400 --> 08:52.320
how these tenses are formed. But now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

08:59.360 --> 09:04.320
This is action five news reporter Sarah O'Connor reporting live from Washington DC

09:04.320 --> 09:09.440
where a protest has broken out thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed

09:09.440 --> 09:16.960
bailout of the auto manufacturing industry. Sir Sarah O'Connor tell us what's happening.

09:16.960 --> 09:23.040
Yeah yeah we're here because we feel this is an injustice. The financial and responsibility

09:23.040 --> 09:28.080
of big business has to stop. We're here to show the government that we don't like the way they're

09:28.080 --> 09:34.720
spending our tax dollars. Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry. It's an absolute

09:34.720 --> 09:40.160
outrage Sarah the US government wants to give twenty five billion dollars of taxpayers money

09:40.160 --> 09:45.760
to the auto industry. These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now newly bankrupt.

09:45.760 --> 09:51.680
I see but many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions

09:51.680 --> 09:56.160
of hardware from the Americans. That may be true and I for what don't want to see anyone lose their

09:56.160 --> 10:01.120
job. But how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars?

10:01.120 --> 10:06.800
And then they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets. This cost hundreds of thousands

10:06.800 --> 10:13.200
of dollars. They're asking for money. That is just not right. Good point. This is Sarah O'Connor

10:13.200 --> 10:16.080
reporting live from Washington DC back to Utah.

10:16.320 --> 10:27.440
Okay Erica so what do you think about this situation?

10:27.440 --> 10:33.920
About the bailout of the auto industry. I think it's a bad idea. Why? There's so many reasons.

10:33.920 --> 10:39.600
I mean I don't think it's fair for us as taxpayers. Well I guess I'm not really an American

10:40.560 --> 10:46.000
but I don't think it's fair for the taxpayers to have to pay for the mismanagement of these

10:46.000 --> 10:50.720
companies. I mean they've got so much debt. They've produced cars that nobody really wants to buy

10:50.720 --> 10:55.760
and now they're in trouble and it's not our money that should be spent on saving them.

10:55.760 --> 11:01.200
Yeah I would agree with you on that but you do have to take into consideration the fact that

11:01.200 --> 11:06.880
if these companies go bankrupt thousands of people will lose their jobs and not only the people

11:06.880 --> 11:13.120
that work at the factories but also people that work for other companies that supply these factories.

11:13.120 --> 11:18.640
Yeah I mean I see what you're saying Marko but at the same time we can't support an industry

11:18.640 --> 11:23.760
that isn't working properly. I mean if one of these companies goes bankrupt it's going to be

11:23.760 --> 11:29.520
terrible but it will force the other two companies perhaps to manage themselves better to

11:29.520 --> 11:33.200
streamline and become more efficient. I just think it will be better in the future.

11:34.080 --> 11:40.160
Well it could be but also maybe all three companies can go bankrupt. It would be sad because

11:40.160 --> 11:46.960
the American car the American auto industry is a symbol of prosperity. It's also the symbol of like

11:46.960 --> 11:54.320
the American culture in general. I guess that's true. So it would be a shame for it to go bankrupt

11:54.320 --> 11:59.360
because everyone owns a car in the United States or most people and it's just something that we can't

12:00.000 --> 12:03.760
but it is an interesting topic and we also want to know your opinions about it.

12:03.760 --> 12:10.800
Yeah listeners please come to our website at englishpod.com and tell us what you think about this

12:10.800 --> 12:15.440
bailout and about this lesson. On the website we'll post a link to the news article where you can

12:15.440 --> 12:21.200
read a little bit more about this because this is actually going on now. That's true. Well everyone

12:21.200 --> 12:31.200
thanks for listening and until next time. Bye.
