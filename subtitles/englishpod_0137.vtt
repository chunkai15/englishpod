Hello English learners, welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marko.

00:05.600 --> 00:13.800
And my name is Katherine, and today we're talking about something very, very important in the computer age internet internet and internet connections.

00:13.800 --> 00:25.600
Right, I think, well, so many people use the internet now and have it, but it's sometimes a little bit complicated to maybe get a plan or maybe if you're not too familiar with the terms, that's what we're going to be looking at today.

00:25.600 --> 00:34.400
So, listen out for some of these words today, we're talking on the phone with someone who's going to help us get a plan, when we come back, we're talking all about what some of these words and phrases mean.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.600
So, if you're confused, just wait a couple seconds and we'll be back.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.800
Welcome to Gallinet, how can I help you? Hi, I would like to get an internet plan for my house, of course.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.600
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.400
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

00:58.400 --> 01:04.400
This is for broadband internet, with a download speed of 512 kbps.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.600
I have no idea what kbps means.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.600
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.600
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.400
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

01:17.480 --> 01:22.600
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month, which includes a connection speed of

01:22.600 --> 01:26.920
two megabytes. That way, you can play games online without any lag.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.640
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.400
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

01:34.600 --> 01:38.440
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

01:38.440 --> 01:43.080
You're saving yourself 100 bucks right there, and we'll throw in this pen drive.

01:43.080 --> 01:43.640
Awesome!

01:47.400 --> 01:53.080
It's so interesting. A lot of these technical terms specifically for internet and computers and

01:53.080 --> 01:54.840
connection and all that stuff.

01:54.840 --> 01:59.960
Yeah, and the nice thing about some of these words is that they can be used in other ways as well.

01:59.960 --> 02:04.920
So, we're learning about these and expanding our vocabulary, but they're useful in many other

02:05.800 --> 02:07.240
contexts as well.

02:07.240 --> 02:11.320
Okay, so let's get started with these words now in language takeaway.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.680
Language takeaway.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.760
So, this first phrase, for example, is something that you see advertised all the time, and it's,

02:20.760 --> 02:23.080
well, it's a kind of internet connection.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.240
Hmm, broad band internet.

02:25.240 --> 02:30.040
Okay, so internet is pretty clear, but broad band, you might be asking what the heck can this mean?

02:30.040 --> 02:31.800
Okay, so you have broad.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.240
So broad means wide.

02:33.240 --> 02:38.760
Wide, and a band is basically kind of like a frequency that which something works.

02:38.760 --> 02:39.800
Like band width.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.840
Band width, huh?

02:40.840 --> 02:44.120
So you have broad band, you have fast or high speed internet.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.280
That means the bigger the space is, the more information can be transferred.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.840
So it's, it's a fast connection, essentially.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.040
Now, before broad band, we had dial-up internet.

02:54.040 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, remember AOL?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.120
Yeah, exactly.

03:00.120 --> 03:05.320
So you had to use your modem and call a number and then get connected by,

03:05.320 --> 03:08.280
by telephone toy was a dial-up connection, but it was so slow.

03:08.280 --> 03:11.720
And every time it broke, the connection would break.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.000
You had to dial-up again.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.080
And again, the whole process is so annoying.

03:15.080 --> 03:15.720
Exactly.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.920
So, fortunately, now not many people use dial-up anymore, and we have broad band internet.

03:21.880 --> 03:27.320
Now, if you have broad band internet, it's really convenient because you can download any type

03:27.320 --> 03:29.960
of application or music, videos, etc.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.600
Right, so this is another key computer word that actually has a couple of different uses.

03:34.600 --> 03:39.000
For example, as you said, you can download music or download photos.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.800
That means you find a photo on the internet that you like, and you could save it on your computer.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.960
But you can also have a download, so it can be a thing, too.

03:48.040 --> 03:53.560
Okay, so if maybe you're downloading three different files, you have three downloads.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.200
Okay, so two download and download.

03:57.000 --> 03:57.800
Very good.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.000
So now we internet, you have different speeds as we talked about, right?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.600
How fast you're downloading something?

04:02.600 --> 04:07.000
And the guy mentioned a 512 KBPS.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.440
Oh, no, not number one of these KBPS.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.600
So this one, actually this is pretty simple.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.040
You can think about kilobytes.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.040
You've heard about megabytes kilobytes.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.480
This is a size.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.240
That how fast you can receive these packets of information.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.800
So 512 kilobytes per second.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.800
Per second, that's, I have no idea how much that is.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.640
It's maybe a lot, it sounds like a lot.

04:31.640 --> 04:37.880
Right, well basically, it is a lot, but we saw later that he was asking for a connection

04:37.880 --> 04:39.480
speed of two megabytes.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.000
Ooh, so mega is bigger than KBPS, right?

04:43.000 --> 04:43.640
Right.

04:43.640 --> 04:47.880
All right, so these are different speeds of transferring information, right?

04:48.040 --> 04:51.880
So this is a way for you to see what kind of internet plan you want.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.000
Exactly.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.560
And so you have kilobytes, we have megabytes.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.360
And basically, you want a faster connection speed

04:58.360 --> 05:00.760
because you want to avoid lag.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.520
Ooh, lag.

05:02.520 --> 05:06.040
All right, this is a word that you can use in a lot of different ways.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.160
For example, my brother always lags behind.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.240
Okay, so it's a verb.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.600
But in this case, what I'm with the noun.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.080
So lag is slowness.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.440
Yeah, it's like a delay.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.280
Yeah, it's delay in something.

05:18.280 --> 05:23.880
So in this case, I can't even play my video games because there's too much lag.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.480
So that means the internet's too slow.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.920
Too slow, exactly.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.680
So that's what happens when you have a slow connection speed, you have lag.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.360
And as you can say, it refers to something that's slow or delayed.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.040
So you can use it in other contexts when you want to say something is a little bit slow.

05:39.400 --> 05:44.440
Well, and another key thing here, as we're talking about internet connections, is the

05:44.520 --> 05:45.080
router.

05:45.080 --> 05:50.760
So router is something that helps us to route an internet connection.

05:50.760 --> 05:57.080
So for example, it basically distributes the internet connection to different computers or

05:57.080 --> 05:58.360
to different users.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.160
And some of these you plug in, and some of them are wireless.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.600
That means without a wire.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.920
So a wireless router is something that a little box in your house that allows you to

06:06.920 --> 06:11.720
maybe have three or four computers on one broadband connection.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.440
Right.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.640
So it's very popular now.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.960
You go to Starbucks, and you have Wi-Fi.

06:15.960 --> 06:20.760
And in order to have Wi-Fi or wireless internet, you need a router, a wireless router.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.000
Okay, so wireless router.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.160
And finally, what is something that might get in the way of a connection?

06:27.160 --> 06:28.680
You have a firewall.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.200
Very important security measure when navigating the internet.

06:32.200 --> 06:36.280
All right, so a personal firewall is a firewall that you have in your computer to keep people

06:36.280 --> 06:37.480
from spying on you.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.240
This keeps other people out.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.240
So it's exactly that.

06:41.320 --> 06:46.360
It's a wall between your computer and the outside world.

06:46.360 --> 06:51.160
So it protects you from any type of maybe malicious intruders.

06:51.160 --> 06:57.080
Right, and oftentimes governments and public offices, things like that, law offices,

06:57.080 --> 07:02.200
they have firewalls to protect the information that they store because it's so important.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.480
That it's secretive.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.120
Yeah.

07:04.120 --> 07:04.840
So firewalls.

07:04.840 --> 07:09.320
There are many different types of firewalls, but a personal firewall is just a basic one.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.080
Great, so that is our language takeaway for today.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.680
Let's check out this dialogue again and slow it down a bit this time.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.760
Welcome to Gallinet.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.200
How can I help you?

07:26.200 --> 07:29.240
Hi, I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

07:29.240 --> 07:34.120
Of course, we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

07:34.120 --> 07:39.080
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

07:39.080 --> 07:44.040
This is for broadband internet with a download speed of 512kbps.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.120
I have no idea what kbps means.

07:48.120 --> 07:52.040
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.720
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.960
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.400
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month,

08:01.400 --> 08:04.200
which includes a connection speed of two megabytes.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.400
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.680
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.040
Absolutely free.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.880
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

08:14.440 --> 08:18.280
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.920
You're saving yourself 100 bucks right there, and we'll throw in this pen drive.

08:22.920 --> 08:23.560
Awesome!

08:26.120 --> 08:30.360
Alright, great, so we just heard all these awards that we looked at before,

08:30.360 --> 08:34.120
but now why don't we take a look at some of these phrases in fluency builder?

08:35.240 --> 08:36.360
Fluency builder.

08:37.000 --> 08:37.960
What's this first one?

08:37.960 --> 08:39.000
I can't read it.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.760
I have no idea.

08:40.760 --> 08:41.320
What?

08:41.320 --> 08:42.280
Well, didn't you write it down?

08:43.160 --> 08:45.320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.320
Alright, enough game, no.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.160
I have no idea.

08:49.160 --> 08:53.560
This is, well, it's going to treat this as a phrase that gets said as is.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.800
We're not going to take bits and pieces of it.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.000
So I have no idea, or he has no idea.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.240
It's a way to say, listen, I don't know.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.080
I don't know, I really don't know.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.360
Right, the guy was talking about KBPS and all these things,

09:06.360 --> 09:09.800
and the other guy was like, I have no idea what you're talking about.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.920
I don't understand.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.840
And I can, I can definitely...

09:12.840 --> 09:14.200
You can relate.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.440
Yeah, well, we'll leave that for another one.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.400
But after this, it got a bucks, alright?

09:19.400 --> 09:22.280
So bucks, what is this slang?

09:22.280 --> 09:24.840
Bucks, 100 bucks, 200 bucks.

09:24.840 --> 09:25.640
A lot of money.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.760
Right, so bucks is basically another way of saying dollars.

09:28.760 --> 09:32.760
Alright, so this is a way for, well, this is a way that most Americans talk about money.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.280
It's one buck is one US dollar, alright?

09:36.280 --> 09:38.680
So, kind of brought 10 bucks, Marco.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.880
Right, so yeah, sure.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.680
There you go.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.400
Now, bucks, you can only use it for American currency, right?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.000
You can't use it for, like, euros, or...

09:45.000 --> 09:45.640
No, no.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.640
You can't say, like, 10 euros would be 10 bucks.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.440
Usually you say this about American dollars,

09:50.440 --> 09:52.600
and you say this, just when you're hanging out,

09:52.600 --> 09:53.800
or how much is this cost?

09:53.800 --> 09:54.840
Oh, five bucks.

09:54.840 --> 09:55.320
Mm-hmm.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.360
Yeah, very good.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.480
So the guy was telling him about the price of the internet and everything,

09:59.480 --> 10:02.680
and he said that he's going to throw in a pendrive, right?

10:03.080 --> 10:04.280
He's going to throw it, right?

10:04.280 --> 10:05.480
I'm going to throw it, I don't know.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.360
He's going to throw in a pendrive for free.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.480
Oh, sweet.

10:09.480 --> 10:13.560
So throw in means to add or include.

10:13.560 --> 10:19.560
Include, so, listen, sir, here's your large popcorn,

10:19.560 --> 10:22.200
and I'm going to throw in a small diet coke for free.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.160
Wow.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.240
So that's interesting.

10:25.240 --> 10:29.080
So you throw in something, it's, you include it for free, right?

10:29.080 --> 10:29.720
Exactly.

10:29.720 --> 10:33.160
So this is usually a complimentary item.

10:33.160 --> 10:36.520
Great, I think this word is really interesting or this phrase.

10:36.520 --> 10:41.160
So why don't we listen to a couple of other examples using throw in?

10:41.160 --> 10:43.960
Example one.

10:43.960 --> 10:49.080
If you buy two pizzas, we will throw in another one for free.

10:49.080 --> 10:49.880
Example two.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.760
Tell you what.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.720
I'll buy this computer if you throw in a pair of headphones.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.080
Deal?

11:01.080 --> 11:02.200
Example three.

11:04.760 --> 11:09.080
The salesman threw in a subscription to the local newspaper for buying his product.

11:09.080 --> 11:09.800
Isn't that great?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.200
All right, great, so good examples.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.720
I think it's clear now, the phrase is all these words related to the internet.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.640
Absolutely, and so useful.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.000
Right, so why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time,

11:23.000 --> 11:24.840
and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.240
Welcome to Gallinet.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.600
How can I help you?

11:32.600 --> 11:35.800
Hi, I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.440
Of course.

11:37.800 --> 11:41.560
We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from.

11:41.560 --> 11:46.520
The first one is the cheapest, but most basic plan, which is $30 a month.

11:46.520 --> 11:51.480
This is for broadband internet with a download speed of 512 KBPS.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.560
I have no idea what KBPS means.

11:55.640 --> 11:59.480
I just want to be able to get online, play games, and chat with my friends.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.160
Oh, and watch movies online as well.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.320
Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.760
I suggest you get the premium package for $50 a month,

12:08.760 --> 12:11.640
which includes a connection speed of two megabytes.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.760
That way, you can play games online without any lag.

12:14.760 --> 12:19.480
This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall, absolutely free.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.240
Do I have to pay an installation fee?

12:22.200 --> 12:26.280
Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation fee.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.080
You're saving yourself 100 bucks right there,

12:29.080 --> 12:30.920
and we'll throw in this pen drive.

12:30.920 --> 12:31.560
Awesome!

12:36.200 --> 12:40.280
So the internet is a big deal nowadays, and now you can do so much on it.

12:40.280 --> 12:46.920
Not only navigate websites anymore, but watch movies, download applications, photos,

12:46.920 --> 12:50.120
Facebook, all this type of things now that you can do on the internet.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.960
You can even do it from your phone.

12:51.960 --> 12:55.320
Like when you're in the bathroom or on the train, and when it's scary,

12:55.320 --> 12:57.640
there's we're always connected.

12:57.640 --> 13:02.920
Right, so it's interesting, you're always connected, you're always online with people,

13:02.920 --> 13:07.480
and it's actually very noticeable when you maybe live somewhere else,

13:07.480 --> 13:09.560
before you used to have to write letters.

13:09.560 --> 13:13.480
I don't think many people will receive handwritten letters anymore.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.200
Never.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.200
I'm speaking for myself, I never receive, and I don't write them either.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.040
So, I guess I'm guilty of it.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.240
So now people just send emails, obviously it's more convenient,

13:23.240 --> 13:26.920
but maybe it's a little bit less significant, maybe,

13:26.920 --> 13:30.360
and actually going to the post office or taking the time to write a letter,

13:30.360 --> 13:31.880
going to the post office and stuff.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.800
Well, I don't know, there's something nice about having a physical thing you can hold on to,

13:35.800 --> 13:38.440
but I wonder if one day we're going to forget how to write.

13:38.440 --> 13:38.920
Yeah.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.440
You know, like write with a pen?

13:40.440 --> 13:41.880
With a pen and pencil, exactly.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.600
We're going to have these little PDAs and these little iPhones,

13:44.600 --> 13:46.280
and they're going to just, you're going to talk,

13:46.280 --> 13:48.440
and they're going to take everything down and note form for you.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.400
Well, now it's kind of happening with the Kindle, right?

13:51.400 --> 13:56.840
Now you can have books on this electronic device that lets you read through them, and, huh?

13:56.840 --> 13:58.280
You can carry a hundred books with you.

13:58.280 --> 13:58.600
Exactly.

13:58.600 --> 13:59.560
So, beach.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.600
So, now you don't even really need physical books,

14:02.600 --> 14:06.520
and you know, which is good on some level, because, you know, you're saving trees,

14:06.520 --> 14:08.520
and space, and all that stuff.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.280
But, but there's something, I don't know, physical, about reading a book.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.720
You hold it, you flip the pages, you know how many pages you have left.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.400
I don't know, we'll see.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.520
Maybe I'll be a Convert one day, but for now, I'm good with paper books.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.400
All right, so, well, what do you guys think about the internet

14:23.400 --> 14:25.160
about electronic book?

14:25.160 --> 14:28.520
You can also tell us any problems, or confusion you have with the things that we

14:28.520 --> 14:29.640
