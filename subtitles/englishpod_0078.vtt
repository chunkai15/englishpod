00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we're

00:07.200 --> 00:11.400
bringing you an advanced lesson for all of our advanced learners out there.

00:11.400 --> 00:15.960
That's right and in this lesson we're visiting a history class.

00:15.960 --> 00:21.200
Yes, we're going to be talking about a very interesting topic that's known around the

00:21.200 --> 00:23.800
world which is international workers day.

00:23.800 --> 00:29.480
That's right and we're going to learn a little bit about the history of the workers movement

00:29.480 --> 00:30.480
in the United States.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.480
Right, but we're also going to be taking a look at some great words and of course a little

00:34.480 --> 00:37.480
bit more advanced or complicated structures.

00:37.480 --> 00:52.840
That's right, so I guess without further ado, we can get started with the dialogue.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.840
All right, everyone settled down.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.480
Let's get started.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.440
As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis

01:01.440 --> 01:03.520
of our legal system.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.720
It's not enough to simply memorize our laws.

01:05.720 --> 01:10.800
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.320
This brings me to our topic for today.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.920
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May 1st?

01:15.920 --> 01:17.920
Syncod of my own?

01:17.920 --> 01:26.040
No, that's May 5th in Spanish James.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.880
No wonder you're failing my Spanish class.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.880
No.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.680
May 1st is international workers day.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.960
Do we get a day off from school, eh?

01:33.960 --> 01:34.960
No.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.200
It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the U.S., but another country is it?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.480
Oh man.

01:41.480 --> 01:46.400
In the 19th century, working conditions were appalling with workers being forced to work

01:46.400 --> 01:49.560
10, 12 and 14 hours a day.

01:49.560 --> 01:54.300
Support for the 8-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and

01:54.300 --> 01:56.860
hostility of many union leaders.

01:56.860 --> 02:03.180
And by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.

02:03.180 --> 02:08.060
Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers

02:08.060 --> 02:09.860
took drastic measures.

02:09.860 --> 02:14.660
They passed the resolutions stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

02:14.660 --> 02:18.540
And on May 1st 1886, the resolution took effect.

02:18.540 --> 02:19.540
Cool.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.620
Is that why we only work eight hours now?

02:21.620 --> 02:22.780
Yes.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.420
Well, the happy ending came at a high price.

02:25.420 --> 02:31.740
On May 3rd 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reber Works Factory,

02:31.740 --> 02:36.580
killing four and wounding many, a mass meeting was called for the next day to protest

02:36.580 --> 02:37.580
the brutality.

02:37.580 --> 02:39.140
And then what happened?

02:39.140 --> 02:48.220
Well, as we say, the rest is history.

02:48.300 --> 02:53.100
All right, so we were in a history class and we learned something new, something interesting,

02:53.100 --> 02:54.100
right?

02:54.100 --> 02:55.700
Yeah, international workers' day.

02:55.700 --> 02:59.100
It's not celebrated in the US, but in many other countries it is.

02:59.100 --> 03:03.220
Right, on May 1st, a lot of people have a day off, so that's always good.

03:03.220 --> 03:04.220
Yes.

03:04.220 --> 03:07.700
All right, so why don't we take a look at some of the words that we saw in this dialogue,

03:07.700 --> 03:12.980
which were maybe a little bit different or difficult in language takeaway?

03:12.980 --> 03:14.260
Language takeaway.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.500
All right, we're just going to look at five words here and the first one.

03:18.500 --> 03:22.260
We talked about the genesis of the movement.

03:22.260 --> 03:23.620
Right, genesis.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.740
Genesis.

03:24.740 --> 03:28.780
Okay, so many of you may know that Genesis is a book in the Bible, right?

03:28.780 --> 03:30.780
That's right, that's where this word comes from.

03:30.780 --> 03:32.780
It's the first book in the Bible.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.980
So it's the beginning or the origin.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.460
Origin, so that's a genesis.

03:36.460 --> 03:40.180
So the genesis of our legal system, you would say.

03:40.180 --> 03:43.420
Right, or the genesis of this problem.

03:43.580 --> 03:44.580
So it's the origin.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.980
Yeah, it's a little bit of a formal word, isn't it?

03:46.980 --> 03:50.380
Yeah, I guess maybe you can say the origin or the beginning.

03:50.380 --> 03:54.340
Yeah, but maybe in an academic setting, you can talk about the genesis.

03:54.340 --> 03:55.820
Yes, very good.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.420
All right, what do we have next?

03:57.420 --> 04:03.420
Well, one of the reasons why the workers movement got started was because of the appalling,

04:03.420 --> 04:05.660
working conditions, appalling,

04:05.660 --> 04:08.700
appalling if something is appalling.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.980
It's shockingly bad.

04:10.980 --> 04:11.900
Very, very bad.

04:11.900 --> 04:15.660
Yeah, so now if something is appalling, like the working conditions were appalling,

04:15.660 --> 04:17.700
that's right, you would feel appalled.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.140
Exactly, I'm appalled at your behavior.

04:20.140 --> 04:22.580
Okay, so it's almost like you are disgusted.

04:22.580 --> 04:23.620
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

04:23.620 --> 04:24.620
Very, very strong word.

04:24.620 --> 04:25.860
Yeah, very strong.

04:25.860 --> 04:30.020
Okay, okay, so the working conditions were appalling and people were setting up this

04:30.020 --> 04:32.740
movement, right, but what happened?

04:32.740 --> 04:35.540
They met some hostility, hostility.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.380
Hostility.

04:36.380 --> 04:37.780
Hostility from the police, right?

04:37.780 --> 04:38.580
That's right.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.100
So what is hostility?

04:40.260 --> 04:44.380
Hostility is the state of receiving an unfriendly reaction.

04:44.380 --> 04:48.460
Okay, they acted in a very unfriendly way and it also suggests, you know,

04:48.460 --> 04:53.380
a hint of violence, even if somebody is hostile.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.860
They can maybe be aggressive and maybe to a point violent.

04:57.860 --> 05:01.220
That's right, okay, so a hostile person.

05:01.220 --> 05:04.500
Yeah, or a hostile environment to dangerous environment.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.540
Okay, hostility, hostile, very good.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.540
Yeah, now because of these appalling working conditions,

05:09.540 --> 05:14.060
the labor movement decided to take drastic measures.

05:14.060 --> 05:15.380
Drastic measures.

05:15.380 --> 05:16.740
Yeah, drastic measures.

05:16.740 --> 05:19.900
This is a really wonderful phrase and I think it would help us to listen

05:19.900 --> 05:23.620
to a few examples of this phrase in use.

05:23.620 --> 05:24.780
Example one.

05:27.540 --> 05:29.620
The president was faced with some difficult decisions.

05:29.620 --> 05:32.740
I was forced to take drastic measures to solve the crisis.

05:36.340 --> 05:37.420
Example two.

05:39.700 --> 05:43.500
The police took very drastic measures to control the protesters outside

05:43.500 --> 05:44.820
the government palace.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.340
So we understand drastic measures as extreme actions or decisions, right?

05:51.340 --> 05:52.340
Yeah, exactly.

05:52.340 --> 05:56.380
I think there's a saying that says desperate times call for drastic measures.

05:56.380 --> 05:58.700
No, desperate times call for desperate measures.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.140
I have.

06:00.140 --> 06:03.020
Well, okay, but it goes around there somewhere, right?

06:03.020 --> 06:07.180
So if you really have an emergency, you need to do something drastic.

06:07.180 --> 06:12.100
You have to take drastic measures or you can even say take drastic action.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.660
Okay, very good.

06:13.660 --> 06:14.980
And what about our last word?

06:14.980 --> 06:20.660
After the protest ended in violence, people started to get angry

06:20.660 --> 06:23.500
because of the brutality, the police showed.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.860
Okay, brutality.

06:24.860 --> 06:25.860
Brutality.

06:25.860 --> 06:30.260
So again, maybe brutality and hostility are maybe similar, right?

06:30.260 --> 06:31.540
It's a little bit similar.

06:31.540 --> 06:35.620
So brutality is the state of being harsh or very forceful.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.100
Okay, so brutality.

06:37.100 --> 06:40.060
Now, we also use the word brutal, right?

06:40.060 --> 06:42.380
So that means harsh or very forceful.

06:42.380 --> 06:47.180
Now, sometimes we can use that word, but not in a harsh or forceful way, right?

06:47.180 --> 06:50.220
Yeah, and it's quite, yeah, I might say something like,

06:50.220 --> 06:52.540
oh my god, that test was brutal.

06:52.540 --> 06:56.140
Uh-huh, it was brutal or so it was really hard or really difficult.

06:56.140 --> 06:56.660
Right.

06:56.660 --> 07:01.180
So that's what you're saying with this word that it's very hard or it was very intense.

07:01.180 --> 07:02.980
Yeah, maybe one more, one more example.

07:03.060 --> 07:07.700
Okay, so for example, I can say, oh, I went for a run today and it was brutal.

07:07.700 --> 07:08.700
So so tired.

07:08.700 --> 07:09.940
So it was really difficult.

07:09.940 --> 07:14.420
Yeah, and Marco, is this something that's used by everyone?

07:14.420 --> 07:18.820
That phrase brutal, using in, in that context would be for younger people, maybe,

07:18.820 --> 07:21.260
not really, you wouldn't really hear older people using it.

07:21.260 --> 07:23.140
So it's a little bit slang, yeah.

07:23.140 --> 07:24.220
Okay, all right.

07:24.220 --> 07:25.220
Great, great.

07:25.220 --> 07:28.300
So those are five interesting vocabulary words.

07:28.300 --> 07:32.340
As Marco mentioned, we want to look at some more difficult structures now

07:32.340 --> 07:37.260
in fluency builder fluency builder.

07:37.260 --> 07:42.820
Okay, so we have some phrases that we saw in this dialogue and, well, let's start with

07:42.820 --> 07:43.820
the first one.

07:43.820 --> 07:47.460
Well, the teacher opens his discussion by talking about how an understanding of the

07:47.460 --> 07:51.940
legal system is an important aspect of being a good citizen.

07:51.940 --> 07:54.140
Okay, an important aspect.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.140
An important aspect.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.140
So well, maybe we know the word important, right?

07:57.140 --> 07:58.140
So what's the aspect?

07:58.140 --> 08:00.780
A part of something, an important part of something.

08:00.780 --> 08:01.780
Okay.

08:01.780 --> 08:06.260
The teacher started with an important aspect of and then specified the idea or what part

08:06.260 --> 08:07.260
it belongs to.

08:07.260 --> 08:08.260
Right.

08:08.260 --> 08:09.260
So it usually follows this form.

08:09.260 --> 08:12.380
Now, is an important aspect of noun.

08:12.380 --> 08:13.380
Okay.

08:13.380 --> 08:19.500
So for example, quality control is an important aspect of keeping customers happy.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.300
Okay, perfect, a part of very good.

08:22.300 --> 08:26.020
So aspect sounds a little bit more formal or just a lot more intelligent, right?

08:26.020 --> 08:27.180
Yeah, professional.

08:27.180 --> 08:30.820
And actually this, it's a wonderful way of setting up your idea.

08:30.820 --> 08:34.780
So the teacher said that it's an important aspect of understanding the legal system was

08:34.780 --> 08:37.140
understanding its origins or its genesis.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.140
Yep.

08:38.140 --> 08:42.820
And then she moved on and said that it's not enough to simply memorize laws.

08:42.820 --> 08:43.820
That's right.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.820
It's not enough to simply do something.

08:45.820 --> 08:46.820
Okay.

08:46.820 --> 08:52.020
So the beginning of this sentence, it's not enough to simply something.

08:52.020 --> 08:55.740
By starting a sentence like this, you are indicating that more is required, right?

08:55.740 --> 08:59.460
So here, it's not enough to simply memorize the laws.

08:59.460 --> 09:04.100
They're saying that most people just memorize the laws, but they need to go further.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.100
And understand them.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.100
Exactly.

09:06.100 --> 09:11.540
Another example would be, it's not enough to simply pass your exams.

09:11.540 --> 09:14.340
You must get good grades as well.

09:14.340 --> 09:15.340
Right.

09:15.340 --> 09:19.700
Or maybe in a business context, it's not enough to simply satisfy your customers.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.060
You must impress them.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.060
Okay.

09:22.060 --> 09:23.060
Very good.

09:23.060 --> 09:27.020
So that's a very good way of starting out this idea of more is required.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.020
That's right.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.020
More is required.

09:29.020 --> 09:30.020
All right.

09:30.020 --> 09:32.300
Well, I want to move on to one final point here.

09:32.300 --> 09:36.220
I found this sentence to be really, really interesting.

09:36.220 --> 09:42.180
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

09:42.180 --> 09:43.180
Okay.

09:43.180 --> 09:44.900
So, why is this interesting?

09:44.900 --> 09:48.860
Well, I found that, you know, there's two verbs going on here.

09:48.860 --> 09:55.460
They passed a resolution that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

09:55.460 --> 09:58.780
So we've got two verb times going on here at the same time.

09:58.780 --> 10:01.540
I'm wondering what this one would.

10:01.540 --> 10:02.540
Okay.

10:02.540 --> 10:03.540
So what's happened here?

10:03.540 --> 10:04.820
Obviously this happened in the past.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.340
It's like about a hundred years ago, right?

10:06.340 --> 10:07.340
Right.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.220
So the resolution was passed a hundred years ago.

10:10.220 --> 10:11.220
Right.

10:11.220 --> 10:12.860
So this is going on in the past.

10:12.860 --> 10:13.860
Right.

10:13.860 --> 10:17.380
But there was a future action that was going to happen in consequence of this.

10:17.380 --> 10:18.380
Right.

10:18.380 --> 10:23.220
So the resolution stated that eight hours would constitute.

10:23.220 --> 10:27.220
So that's like the primary action was the passing of the resolution.

10:27.220 --> 10:32.820
And the result is this sort of event that happens in the past, but is a future event

10:32.820 --> 10:35.100
to the first time we're event.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.780
Does that make any sense at all?

10:36.780 --> 10:38.780
So this is called the future in the past, right?

10:38.780 --> 10:39.780
That's right.

10:39.780 --> 10:40.780
Okay.

10:40.780 --> 10:41.780
So it's a grammar structure.

10:41.780 --> 10:46.980
Manio, you may be know the simple present or the future tenses, but this is a little

10:46.980 --> 10:47.980
strange one.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.300
And as we said, so it may be it's a little bit difficult to understand the grammar in

10:51.300 --> 10:52.300
general.

10:52.300 --> 10:55.860
So why don't we take a look at some more examples of how we would use this future in

10:55.860 --> 10:56.860
the past?

10:57.700 --> 11:01.100
Example one.

11:01.100 --> 11:07.780
The president said that he would cut taxes by 5%.

11:07.780 --> 11:12.140
Example two.

11:12.140 --> 11:17.620
I made a promise that I would not smoke anymore.

11:17.620 --> 11:22.220
Example three.

11:22.260 --> 11:27.700
How told me he would buy a new car?

11:27.700 --> 11:28.700
Okay.

11:28.700 --> 11:32.540
So now I think it's clear this whole idea of the future in the past and will also be

11:32.540 --> 11:35.220
answering any questions on the site if you have any problems, right?

11:35.220 --> 11:36.220
That's right.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.220
Okay.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.580
So why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk

11:39.580 --> 11:50.660
about this holiday, which is the International Workers Day.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.580
All right, everyone settled down.

11:52.580 --> 11:54.300
Let's get started.

11:54.300 --> 11:58.660
As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the

11:58.660 --> 12:01.340
genesis of our legal system.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.580
It's not enough to simply memorize our laws.

12:03.580 --> 12:08.620
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.700
This brings me to our topic for today.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.780
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May 1st?

12:13.780 --> 12:20.780
Sing good to my O.

12:20.780 --> 12:26.780
That's May 5th in Spanish James, no wonder you're failing my Spanish class.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.580
No, May 1st is International Workers Day.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.780
Do we get a day off from school then?

12:31.780 --> 12:37.220
No, it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but another country

12:37.220 --> 12:38.220
is it?

12:38.220 --> 12:39.420
Oh man.

12:39.420 --> 12:44.340
In the 19th century working conditions were appalling with workers being forced to work

12:44.340 --> 12:50.940
10, 12 and 14 hours a day, support for the 8 hour work day movement was growing rapidly,

12:50.940 --> 12:54.780
despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders.

12:54.780 --> 13:01.180
And by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.

13:01.180 --> 13:05.980
Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers

13:05.980 --> 13:07.780
took drastic measures.

13:07.780 --> 13:12.540
They passed the resolutions, stating that 8 hours would constitute a legal day's work.

13:12.540 --> 13:16.540
And on May 1st, 1886, the resolution took effect.

13:16.540 --> 13:17.540
Cool.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.540
Is that why we only worked 8 hours now?

13:19.540 --> 13:20.540
Yes.

13:20.540 --> 13:23.300
But the happy ending came at a high price.

13:23.300 --> 13:28.740
On May 3rd, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikeers at the McCormick Reaper Works

13:28.740 --> 13:33.820
Factory, killing four and wounding many on mass meeting was called for the next day

13:33.820 --> 13:35.540
to protest the brutality.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.140
And then what happened?

13:37.380 --> 13:39.900
Well, as we say, the rest is history.

13:45.140 --> 13:48.100
All right, so, Erica, in Canada, do you celebrate this?

13:48.100 --> 13:49.700
We do, but not on May 1st.

13:49.700 --> 13:50.500
Oh, really, when is it?

13:50.500 --> 13:51.940
The first weekend in September.

13:51.940 --> 13:53.020
Oh, really, and why?

13:53.020 --> 13:56.300
Um, I am not 100% sure.

13:56.300 --> 14:01.580
I think it's because we already have a long weekend in May, because we sell it because

14:01.580 --> 14:04.740
on the 24th of May is the Queen Victoria's birthday.

14:04.740 --> 14:05.780
So we have to celebrate that.

14:05.940 --> 14:06.780
Really?

14:06.780 --> 14:08.780
Yeah, it can have two vacations in the same month.

14:08.780 --> 14:09.780
Oh, wow.

14:09.780 --> 14:12.020
Well, yeah, I mean, it's not productive, right?

14:12.020 --> 14:13.020
Exactly.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.020
What about an Ecuador?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.260
Yeah, we do on May 1st.

14:15.260 --> 14:21.100
It's a holiday, and we actually have two holidays in May as well, because on the 24th,

14:21.100 --> 14:25.580
we actually celebrate the Battle of Pigeoncha, which is one of the decisive battles for

14:25.580 --> 14:26.940
the independence of Ecuador.

14:26.940 --> 14:30.220
So, we don't mind having two holidays in the same month.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.420
Well, it sounds like Ecuador is a better holiday.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.420
I don't really care that so much.

14:34.420 --> 14:38.940
So yeah, on May 1st, people take vacations, or companies usually on May 1st will do something

14:38.940 --> 14:39.940
special for their employees.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.940
Oh, that's kind of a nice gesture as well.

14:41.940 --> 14:46.780
Yeah, so it's like, it's workers' day, so they'll set up maybe a barbecue or a trip

14:46.780 --> 14:47.900
or something like that.

14:47.900 --> 14:50.100
So that's what usually happens on May 1st.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.100
Great.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.900
Well, what about in your countries?

14:52.900 --> 14:53.900
Listeners.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.900
Do you celebrate May Day?

14:55.900 --> 14:56.900
May Day.

14:56.900 --> 14:57.900
Yeah.

14:57.900 --> 14:58.900
May 1st, right?

14:58.900 --> 15:02.620
And if you do, well, let us know, come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and leave your

15:02.620 --> 15:04.300
questions and comments there as well.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.300
That's right.

15:05.300 --> 15:08.540
Well, thanks for downloading this lesson, and until next time, bye.
