00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
And today we're bringing you the third part of this series that we've created called, I'm sorry I love you.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
That's right, the third part in our story about our EnglishPod couple.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Yeah, it's a romantic series, but today we're bringing you an argument.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
That's right.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I can every relationship, you have fights, you have discussions.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
So we're going to teach you how to do that in English.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
That's right.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
In today's lesson, you'll learn some great language that people use when they get into an argument with their boyfriend or girlfriend.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Right. So when do we take a look at vocabulary preview?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
We have one phrase today.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Get a hold.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Get a hold.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Get a hold.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
To get a hold.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
To get a hold of someone means to try and communicate with that person.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Exactly.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
So to try and call that person.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
For example, I can say, I've been calling his phone all day, but I can't get a hold of him.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Or I could say, finally, Marco, I got a hold of you.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Where have you been all day?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Exactly.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Now we're going to listen to our dialogue.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
And as always, it's going to be at a normal pace, but you don't have to worry about it.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
We'll come back and teach you all of the important words.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Stephen, where have you been?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I, uh, there was an emergency at work.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I was looking for you in the restaurant for three hours.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
And you didn't even have the decency to call me.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
It's just that I...

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, right.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I've heard it all before.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
This is the fence time you stood me up in two weeks.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
You need to get your priority straight.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Come on Veronica, that's not fair.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I do care about you a lot.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
You know that.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I try to...

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
What?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Maybe we should just take a break.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
But Veronica, would you listen to me?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
There was a fire alarm at my office building today.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
And I was...

02:20.000 --> 02:30.000
Okay, so a little bit of trouble in the relationship.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah, that's too bad.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah, well, I think she's overreacting.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
You do?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
We'll talk about that later on.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
But we saw some great words and phrases here,

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
so it's time for language takeaway.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Language takeaway.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Today on language takeaway, we're bringing you three words.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
The first word is stood me up.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
stood me up.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
stood me up.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
stood me up.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
The phrase stand someone up.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
When do we use this?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
If, for example, you have a date and you don't go.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Okay, so let's say you and I were supposed to have dinner together.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Right.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
And you just didn't come.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Right.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
And didn't call.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Right.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
So I stood you up.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Stand someone up.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Our next word, priorities.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Priorities.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Priorities.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
So priorities are something that's really important in your life.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
That's right, like family or maybe work or making a lot of money.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Whatever it is.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
What are your priorities in life?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Right.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Okay.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And our last word for language takeaway, heading.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Heading.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Heading.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
This is a bit of a funny verb.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
So let's listen to a couple of examples of how it's used so we can understand it's meaning.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Example one.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
I don't know where our relationship is heading.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
Example two.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Where's this bus heading?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Example three.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Where is this project heading?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
So basically heading means going.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Exactly.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
A heading is where you're going.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yep.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Okay.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Easy word.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Interesting.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Okay.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
So now it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
It's going to be slower.

04:31.000 --> 04:41.000
So now we can understand the words that we just talked about.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Stephen.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Where have you been?

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I...

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
There was an emergency at work.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
So I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And you didn't even have the decency to call me.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
It's just that I...

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah right.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I've heard it all before.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm going to take any more of your empty promises.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
This is the fifth time you've stood me up in two weeks.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
You need to get your priority straight.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Come on, Veronica, that's not fair.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I do care about you a lot.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
You know that.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I tried.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
You know what?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Maybe we should just take a break.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
But Veronica, would you just listen to me?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
There was a fire alarm at my office building today.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
And I was stuck.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Okay, now we saw some interesting phrases in dialogue.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah, we saw some great phrases that people use when they're getting in a fight.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Right.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Why don't we take a look at some of them in Fluency Builder?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Fluency Builder.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
The first phrase that I want to take a look at today is, do you have any idea?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Do you have any idea?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Do you have any idea?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
This is a great way to set up an argument.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
So let's listen to some examples of how you would set up an argument using this phrase.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Example one.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
You forgot my birthday.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Do you have any idea how angry I am?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Example two.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Julie kissed my boyfriend.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Does she have any idea how mean that was?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Example three.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Don't you have any idea how sad I am?

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
So it's a great phrase to make that person understand that you were really worried or really angry.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Okay.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Another second phrase that we can take a look at is, I've heard it all before.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I've heard it all before.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I've heard it all before.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I've heard it all before.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
So this is a great phrase of just saying, you don't have to give me an excuse.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I know what you're going to say.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Exactly.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
And our last phrase today, take a break.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Take a break.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Take a break.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
So when a couple takes a break, they sort of stop their relationship, right?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
They're breaking up.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Yeah, but it's, is it really like forever, like a break up that lasts forever?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Not will maybe.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
It could be forever, but they're saying let's just take some time away from each other for a couple of days or weeks.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
And see what happens.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yes.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Take a break.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Take a break.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Okay.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
So our happy couple is going to take a break.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Well, I guess they're not that happy that happened.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
So let's listen to our dialogue again.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And then we'll come back and talk us more.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Stephen, where have you been?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I, uh, there was an emergency at work.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
I was waiting for you in the restaurant for three hours.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And you didn't even have the decency to call me.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Honey, I promise this won't happen again.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
It's just that I...

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah, right.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I've heard it all before.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
This is the fit time you stood me up in two weeks.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You need to get your priority straight.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm tired of you putting your job first all the time.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Come on, Veronica.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
That's not fair.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I do care about you a lot.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
You know that.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
I try to...

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
There's what?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Maybe we should just take a break.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I need some time to think about where this relationship is heading.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
But Veronica, would you listen to me?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
There was a fire alarm at my office building today.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
And I was...

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
So, Marco, this phrase to take a break really reminds me of a friend's episode.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, that really famous friend's episode.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
When Ross and Rachel were on a break...

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And Ross went with another girl.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And then they definitely broke up after that.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
So, that's one of the key issues, right?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Right.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
If you're taking a break, can you start to date someone else?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I've got to agree with Rachel.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Really?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah, no, you can't.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You can't.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
So, what's the point of taking a break?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
You need some time away.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You need some time to think.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
But you're not really broken up.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Exactly.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
That's convenient.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
I don't know.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
They were on a break.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I agree with Ross.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Well, you would.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Wouldn't you?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
All right, guys.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
We're out of time today.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Hope you enjoyed our lesson.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
And be sure to listen next time because we will definitely have a part for this.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Yes.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Coming out soon.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yep.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
And also come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave all your questions and comments.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah, Marco and I are always happy to hear from you and we love answering your questions.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Right.
