00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us here at English Pod.

00:07.280 --> 00:13.640
My name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we have a lesson for all our university students

00:13.640 --> 00:14.640
out there.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.640
That's right.

00:15.640 --> 00:22.680
We're talking about registering for university okay so it's a difficult process sometimes

00:22.680 --> 00:27.680
even in your own language so we're going to try and make it a little bit easier by giving

00:27.680 --> 00:32.440
you some of the common words you would need to register at a university.

00:32.440 --> 00:38.040
Alright well I think it's time we get started by listening to the dialogue and we're

00:38.040 --> 00:53.120
going to listen to a young female student as she tries to choose her classes.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.880
Excuse me is this where I register?

00:55.880 --> 00:58.560
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.560
Yes of course I need your student ID please.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.560
Here you are.

01:03.560 --> 01:09.720
Okay Susan it says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year

01:09.720 --> 01:11.720
is this information correct?

01:11.720 --> 01:16.640
Yes I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.200
Sure that's not a problem.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.160
Do you have the list of courses that you want to take this semester?

01:21.200 --> 01:23.400
Yeah here's my list.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.680
I'm not sure if the class schedule allowed me to take all of them though.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.120
Yeah that's perfect.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.120
What about the subjects for your minor?

01:30.120 --> 01:32.320
Oh yeah I was forgot.

01:32.320 --> 01:37.280
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology and neuro anatomy.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.840
Wow you're going to be busy this semester.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.920
Okay here you go.

01:44.920 --> 01:50.840
You registered now you have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

01:51.440 --> 01:58.360
All right great a very good student taking a lot of classes this semester.

01:58.360 --> 02:01.960
I know and it sounds like some of them are pretty hard as well.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.000
Yeah they are.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.960
Well she used some of those very common phrases that we would need when we are registering

02:08.960 --> 02:13.400
at university so let's take a look at them now in language takeaway.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.400
Language takeaway.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.760
Okay so the first thing I think we need to deal with this word

02:20.800 --> 02:23.960
to register register.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.960
So register for university.

02:25.960 --> 02:31.080
Okay so we've mentioned this word many times so I think it would be a good idea to listen

02:31.080 --> 02:35.520
to some examples and then we'll come back and explain it.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.520
Example one.

02:39.520 --> 02:45.520
I registered to attend the conference on international trade this month.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.520
Example two.

02:48.560 --> 02:53.960
It is your obligation as a good citizen to register to vote.

02:53.960 --> 02:57.400
Example three.

02:57.400 --> 03:02.600
It is necessary to register on our website before joining the conference.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.960
So when you register for something you put your name down on a list right?

03:07.960 --> 03:13.160
So in this case when you register for university you put your you officially put your name

03:13.160 --> 03:16.000
on the list of students in that course.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.200
Okay so you can register for university.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.960
What else can you register for register for a class?

03:22.960 --> 03:25.360
You can even register to vote.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.320
Okay so register.

03:28.320 --> 03:34.360
Now she was registering for her classes and we saw these words that we know already but it's

03:34.360 --> 03:37.000
a good idea to take a look at them.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.040
We heard that she is a business major.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.560
So a major.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.560
A major.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.560
Business major.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.120
And what is your major?

03:46.120 --> 03:52.440
The major is the major area that you study the most important area that you study.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.440
The area where you are specialized.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.120
Yeah the area that you focus on.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.880
Okay now we heard another one that's called a minor.

03:59.880 --> 04:06.840
So this is another area that you study but it is less important than your major.

04:06.840 --> 04:10.040
Okay so major and your minor.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.400
So let's give an example.

04:11.480 --> 04:17.000
Imagine you must take 100 classes to graduate from university.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.720
Maybe you have to take 50 for your major and maybe 30 for your minor.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.320
Okay very good and now on your degree on your title.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.360
Does it say what is your major and minor?

04:28.360 --> 04:32.520
Um well I think it depends on the university but in my case yes.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.320
Okay very good so major and minor.

04:35.320 --> 04:40.040
Yeah now related to this and what you were saying about your classes.

04:40.040 --> 04:46.520
It takes us to our next word which is credits credits credits credits credits.

04:46.520 --> 04:50.920
Now this is easily confused with classes sometimes.

04:50.920 --> 04:54.920
That's right um well a credit is kind of a point.

04:54.920 --> 05:02.120
So like maybe so in university you need a certain number of credits or points to graduate.

05:02.120 --> 05:06.760
Okay so suppose you need 100 credits to graduate.

05:06.760 --> 05:13.480
So that's not 100 courses because each course might be worth four or six or eight credits.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.560
Depending on how important it is.

05:15.560 --> 05:20.600
Very good so maybe the classes that are part of your major will have more credits.

05:20.600 --> 05:28.280
All right very good so and now we have our last word in this dialogue and it was tuition tuition.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.600
She had to pay her tuition.

05:30.600 --> 05:35.080
So tuition is the money that you must pay for education.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.760
Okay only for education.

05:36.760 --> 05:43.480
That's right so university tuition private school tuition or even language course tuition.

05:43.480 --> 05:47.240
Okay so a tuition is the money you must pay for school.

05:47.240 --> 05:52.920
Um yeah so we've seen a lot of great words used for registering at university.

05:52.920 --> 05:58.120
So I think it's time to listen to the dialogue for the second time a little bit slower

05:58.120 --> 06:00.760
and then we'll come back and take a look at some phrases.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.760
Excuse me is this where I register?

06:08.760 --> 06:11.160
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

06:12.280 --> 06:16.040
Yes of course I need your student ID please.

06:16.040 --> 06:16.920
Here you are.

06:16.920 --> 06:22.760
Okay Susan it says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.040
Is this information correct?

06:24.920 --> 06:30.360
Yes um I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.800
Sure that's not a problem.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.240
Do you have a list of courses that you want to take this semester?

06:35.240 --> 06:37.080
Yeah here's my list.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.440
I'm not sure if the class got to allow me to take all of them though.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.720
Yeah that's perfect.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.960
What about the subjects for your minor?

06:43.960 --> 06:45.560
Oh yeah and I was forgot.

06:46.200 --> 06:51.320
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology and neuro anatomy.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.160
Wow you're going to be busy this semester.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.480
Okay here you go.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.520
You registered now.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.240
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.160
All right so it's time for putting it together.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.440
Put you in together.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.920
And we're going to look at some phrases here that we can use to talk about education and

07:12.920 --> 07:15.640
university and we can use them in different ways.

07:16.280 --> 07:20.200
All right and our first phrase is actually very similar to register.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.920
Hmm to sign up for something.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.480
Okay I want to sign up for.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.800
I'd like to sign up for my courses.

07:27.960 --> 07:32.360
I think it would be a good idea if we'd listen to some examples of how we can use this phrase.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.360
Example one.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.080
I signed up for a one year gym membership.

07:41.160 --> 07:41.880
Example two.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.680
If you want to assist our meeting you need to sign up first.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.840
Example three.

07:51.240 --> 07:55.400
I hate signing up for things online because they just send you spam emails.

07:56.360 --> 08:03.640
Okay so I can see that two sign up for something is to agree to take part in it.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.760
Okay so it's a little bit more informal than register.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.520
Yeah exactly less formal.

08:08.520 --> 08:13.080
All right so moving on to our second phrase.

08:13.080 --> 08:17.080
This is very important because it's often used improperly right?

08:17.080 --> 08:20.200
Yeah people often make mistakes with this phrase.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.040
All right so let's look at this phrase second year.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.760
So she is in her second year.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.280
Now it seems very simple.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.280
So why are we explaining this?

08:30.280 --> 08:34.280
Well it often gets confused with grade.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.920
So when we talk about university we talk about first year, second year, third year, fourth year.

08:39.640 --> 08:43.240
We cannot say grade one, grade two, grade three, grade four.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.920
Or year one year two.

08:44.920 --> 08:48.840
No it's always first year, second year, third year, fourth year.

08:48.840 --> 08:49.880
Okay very good.

08:49.880 --> 08:50.840
Or last year.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.720
Yeah last year.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.240
My last year of college.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.120
Exactly.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.000
Very good so.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.200
So now you know how you can explain to someone what year of college or university you're in.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.240
Yes that's right.

09:01.240 --> 09:01.960
Very good.

09:01.960 --> 09:07.240
And we have one more phrase to you and it was when she was getting her class schedule.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.400
So class schedule.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.240
Class schedule.

09:11.240 --> 09:16.200
Now a schedule is the list of things you do at what time.

09:16.200 --> 09:20.440
Right so it's the time table of your day or your week.

09:20.440 --> 09:20.920
Yep.

09:20.920 --> 09:21.560
All right.

09:21.640 --> 09:26.760
And your class schedule will say all the classes that you have and what time they're at.

09:26.760 --> 09:30.200
So what other types of schedules can we have?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.360
You also have maybe a gym schedule.

09:32.360 --> 09:32.920
That's right.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.160
Or even a work schedule.

09:35.160 --> 09:35.800
Right.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.440
So we have different types of schedules and you can use it depending on what you are doing.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.640
Those are all the phrases we have for putting it together today.

09:43.640 --> 09:48.600
And now let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

09:51.560 --> 09:58.600
Excuse me.

09:58.600 --> 09:59.640
Is this where I register?

09:59.640 --> 10:02.280
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.640
Yes of course.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.120
I need your student ID please.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.480
Here you are.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.920
Okay Susan.

10:08.920 --> 10:13.720
It says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.560
Is this information correct?

10:15.560 --> 10:16.520
Yes.

10:16.520 --> 10:20.360
I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.880
Sure, that's not a problem.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.000
Do you have a list of courses that you want to take this semester?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.280
Yeah, here's my list.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.520
I'm not sure if the class schedule allowed me to take all of them though.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.800
Yeah, that's perfect.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.800
What about the subjects for your minor?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.400
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

10:36.040 --> 10:41.160
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.000
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.520
Okay, here you go.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.560
You're registered now.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.200
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

10:58.920 --> 11:02.920
All right, so we were talking about second year, first year, third year, etc.

11:02.920 --> 11:09.720
Yeah, now there are also other names that we give to each year, both for high school and university.

11:09.720 --> 11:15.080
And I think this is only for America, like in the United States.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.280
We don't do this in Canada, and I always get so confused.

11:18.280 --> 11:22.680
So Marco, what is the name you give to first year students?

11:22.680 --> 11:25.960
Okay, so first year students are called freshman.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.000
Okay, because they're fresh.

11:27.000 --> 11:27.720
Because they're fresh.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.320
Yeah, they're just came from middle school.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.520
They just came from high school.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.200
All right, and what about the second year students?

11:32.200 --> 11:33.880
They're called sophomores.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.000
Okay, because they're soft.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.760
Well, it's not soft.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.520
It's soft more like this.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.720
Oh, pH.

11:41.720 --> 11:42.520
Soft more.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.560
Soft more.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.360
And then third year students are called juniors.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.560
Okay, because they're almost like junior manager.

11:49.560 --> 11:50.360
Exactly.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.160
Yeah, because then last year students are called seniors.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.200
Aha, so the oldest guys in the school.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.160
Exactly.

11:57.160 --> 12:01.560
So you can say, yeah, I'm a sophomore at Arizona State University.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.120
Okay, so we only use this in America though, right?

12:04.120 --> 12:05.320
Yes, yes, it's very.

12:05.320 --> 12:09.560
And not only for university, but also for high school.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.840
Okay, all right, guys, that's all the time we have for today.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.600
I hope you enjoyed this lesson.

12:14.600 --> 12:20.280
And if you have any questions or comments or you want to share with us your experiences in high school

12:20.280 --> 12:24.680
or university, please come to the website at EnglishPod.com.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.640
That's right, so Marko and I are there to answer your questions.

12:27.640 --> 12:31.240
And until next time, thanks for listening and goodbye.
