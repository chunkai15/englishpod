00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to the English pod, my name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
And I'm Erica.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
And today we have a special lesson for Arlar's sci-fi or science fiction fans.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Yes, and actually one special user was the inspiration for this lesson.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Wolfgang.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Exactly.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
This one is for you.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Well, sci-fi is very popular Star Trek Star Wars.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
There are some really interesting words that maybe you wouldn't use in real life or in normal circumstances,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
but you do want to understand these movies or why they say these words, right?

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
So we're going to look at some sci-fi language in this lesson.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
But before we start, let's look at vocabulary preview.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
And in vocabulary preview today, we have one phrase only.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
That's right.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Unidentified spacecraft.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Unidentified spacecraft.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Unidentified spacecraft.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Okay, so unidentified.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
You don't know which one it is.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
You don't know the name.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, you don't know the identity.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Okay, and a spacecraft.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
A spacecraft is a vehicle that travels in space.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Okay, also known as a spaceship.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
That's right.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Actually, this is interesting because you know the word UFO.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
That comes from unidentified flying objects.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Exactly.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
So unidentified spacecraft.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
An unknown vehicle flying in space.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Right.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
A UFO.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Have you ever seen a UFO?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
No.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
No.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Have you?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Of course.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Hasn't any of it?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
All right.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Well, I think the people in our dialogue may or may not have seen a UFO.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
So why don't we take a listen.

01:51.000 --> 02:02.000
They are breaking through such a blast of full power.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Excellent job.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Search the ship.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
She's got to be in here somewhere.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Bring her to me.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Lord Hanger, we have a survivor here.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Where is she?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Don't make me destroy you.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Tell me where she is.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Not so fast.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
She will no longer be a prisoner.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
You are unwise and think you can defeat me.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
You know nothing of the power of your obscure side.

02:49.000 --> 03:04.000
So we will stop you.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
Lord Hanger, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rare dock.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
They somehow managed to escape our treasure beam.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
After that.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
They are accelerating towards the speed of light.

03:17.000 --> 03:37.000
Let's go, sir.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Okay, so a really cool Lord Hader.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, you may have noticed that it's similar to a certain movie out there.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Why don't I?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Seems quite original to me.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
But everything for educational purposes.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
That's right.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Okay, so we saw some words that were maybe a little bit difficult.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
So let's take a look at these now in language takeaway.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Language takeaway.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I guess in the dialogue, the bad guys were breaking through.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Breaking through.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Breaking through.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
In the simple present, it would be to break through.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Okay, break through.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
And what does that mean?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, let's listen to some examples to help us find out.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Example one.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
After 15 minutes, the workers broke through the wall and rescued everyone from the fire.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Example two.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
He is such a good player. He broke through the entire defense.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Example three.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
They are breaking through our impenetrable wall.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Run.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
All right, so it's kind of like to enter by four somewhere.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah, to maybe break some glass and come into a room or something like that.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Break through.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
All right, so Lord Hader had a fight with his enemy and he said he wants to settle this.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
To settle this.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Settle.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
So what do you do when you settle something?

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
Well, when you settle something is you end a fight or a dispute or an argument or an argument or a problem.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
When you settle an argument, does everyone always agree?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
No, not always, right?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Right.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Sometimes you are forced to agree.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Okay, not everyone agrees but you have no other choice.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
So it's a little bit different from reaching an agreement because those usually a winner and a loser.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Right, exactly.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
Well, now another very popular word and within sci-fi is this word tractor beam.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Tractor beam.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
A tractor beam.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Tractor beam.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Now I'm not sure of this really exists in real life.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Well, I've never heard of it.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
But a tractor beam in sci-fi movies is like this invisible force.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Uh-huh.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
That grabs an object and doesn't let it escape and brings it towards another spaceship.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
So it's like almost like a rope that you can't see.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Right.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
And it brings it in.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
So the spaceship managed to escape their tractor beam.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Okay, I think that is definitely not true.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Well, maybe.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't know.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
But in sci-fi, you will always hear this tractor beam.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Okay.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Now let's move on to our final word.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
This spaceship was accelerating towards the speed of light.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Accelerating.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Accelerating.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
To accelerate.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
That's right.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
So that means to increase speed, right?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Yeah, just to go faster.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
To go faster.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
So if you are in your car, you want to accelerate so you can pass another car.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Okay.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Or even when you stop at a red light and it turns green.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
You got to accelerate.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Okay.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
To accelerate.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Let's listen to our dialogue again.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
And then we'll come back and take a look at some of the phrases that came up in this

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
dialogue.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
They are breaking through.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Such a blaster.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
A full power.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Excellent job.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Search the ship.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
She's got to be in here somewhere.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Bring her to me.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Lord, hey, we have a survivor here.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Where is she?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Don't make me destroy you.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Tell me where she is.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Not so fast.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
She will no longer be a prisoner.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
We will stop you.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Lord, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
After them, they are accelerating towards the speed of light.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
We lost them, sir.

07:57.000 --> 08:11.000
Well, great.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Well, great.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I think that's a little bit more clear this time.

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
But like Marco said, I want to look at now some phrases that you might hear in a sci-fi context.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Fluency Builder.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
First phrase that we can take a look at and maybe it looks a little bit strange.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
He said, she will no longer be your prisoner.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
No longer be.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
No longer be.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
So what does he mean by no longer?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Any more.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Any more, right?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So you will not be my prisoner anymore.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Okay.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So how would I use it in this form no longer be?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
You've always got to use it in the future tense.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Okay.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
So she'll no longer be your prisoner.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I will no longer be your employee.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Okay.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Or I can say I will no longer be your boyfriend.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Okay.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
So it's always will no longer be.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
It's always in the future.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Okay.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
One more thing, Marco.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Is this quite commonly used or maybe a little bit formal?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I think it's a little bit formal.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
And it's very, I don't know, to a certain point poetic.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
But I think it's why we hear a little bit more often in sci-fi movies.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
All right.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
No longer be.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
What about our next phrase?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Okay.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
You know nothing of.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
So again, it's very poetic.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Basically meaning you don't know about.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
You don't know about.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
So again, let's take a look at how you would use it.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
You know nothing of and then science fiction.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
You know nothing of science fiction.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
So you would use a noun afterwards.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Exactly.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Okay.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
So interesting phrases.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Again, the formal and probably quite often used in science fiction movies.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Mm-hmm.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
But now you can understand when they use some of these words that maybe are a little bit difficult

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
and very common in these types of movies.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Now let's go to our last phrase.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Then this one actually can be used in many different circumstances.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Let's settle this once and for all.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Okay.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So we saw the word settle already.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Now let's settle this once and for all.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Mm-hmm.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Once and for all.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
So what does that mean?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Finally.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
That's right.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Forever.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Okay.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
So once and for all forever.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Mm-hmm.

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use this phrase once and for all in different contexts?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Example one.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
I'm fed up with arguing about this.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Exactly the argument once and for all.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Example two.

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
He claims his photographs prove once and for all that UFOs do exist.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Example three.

11:01.000 --> 11:08.000
I told him once and for all that I don't want to be his girlfriend anymore.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Okay.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
So now I think it's clear we've seen a lot of words.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
We've seen a lot of phrases.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Let's listen to our dialogue one more time.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
They are breaking through such a blast as the full power.

11:36.000 --> 11:45.000
Excellent job.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Search the ship.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
She's got to be in here somewhere.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Bring her to me.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Oh.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Lord Hanger, we have a survivor here.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Where is she?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Don't make me destroy you.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Tell me where she is.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Not so fast. She will no longer be your prisoner.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
You are unwise and think you can defeat me.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
We will stop you.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
More Hanger.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
We have an unwise identified spacecraft taking off from the rare dock.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
They somehow managed to escape our treasure bay.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
After that.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
They are accelerating towards the speed of light.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
We lost them soon.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Okay, so are you a big sci-fi fan?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I think as you can tell, no.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Actually, I've seen some of the Star Wars movies, but everyone that I've watched, I've

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
fallen asleep in the middle of the world.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Really?

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Even in the movie theater, I fell asleep in the movie theater watching Star Wars.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Wow, was it too boring?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
It was too boring.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
You're not really into the fantasy.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
No, I just have the whole time sitting there going, this cannot happen.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, that's why it's called science fiction, right?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yes.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
But it is interesting to some people and well, behind Star Wars, there is a huge culture.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
Even some people know some of the languages or symbols that are used in it, or the names

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
of some of the robots and models of spacecraft.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Well, maybe we'll have to come up with Star Wars pies.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Exactly.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Well, that's all for today, guys.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I hope you enjoyed our lesson.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
