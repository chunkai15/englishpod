Hello English learners. Welcome back to English pod. My name is Marco.

00:06.320 --> 00:11.040
And I'm Erica. And today we're going to have a fun, funny lesson.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.360
That's right. So I think this lesson's going to be a little bit different than most of our lessons, right?

00:15.360 --> 00:21.360
Right. Today we're going to be looking at jokes, which is a very important part of English-speaking culture.

00:21.360 --> 00:26.400
Yeah. So we're actually going to teach you a few pretty hilarious jokes.

00:26.480 --> 00:33.440
But we're also going to teach you some language related to jokes, funny things, and that sort of stuff.

00:33.440 --> 00:38.080
All right. So in order for us to understand a little bit better, the jokes that we're going to be

00:38.080 --> 00:43.920
looking at, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview. Very vocabulary preview.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.960
Two of these words you'll hear in the dialogue, but one you won't, but you still need to know this

00:48.960 --> 00:53.680
word so you can understand the jokes. All right. So the word that we're talking about is not really

00:53.760 --> 01:01.440
a word. It's a sound. Yeah. Moo. So moo is the sound that cows make. That's right. M-O-O.

01:01.440 --> 01:07.920
Right. They go moo. Very nice, Marco. I could do a good cow. Yeah. All right. So we all know now that

01:07.920 --> 01:13.040
that's what cows say. Exactly. So it's going to be important for the joke. You'll see why.

01:13.040 --> 01:23.600
Okay. Now another word that you need to understand is a dam. So a dam. A dam is like a big wall, right?

01:23.600 --> 01:30.720
Well, it's a wall in water that stops the river from flowing. Okay. So usually you built dams in rivers

01:30.720 --> 01:36.160
and then the water can pass or not. Yeah. It's something that you should generate electricity, right?

01:36.160 --> 01:40.320
Very good. But there's another word that sounds exactly the same way, but it's just built

01:40.320 --> 01:45.600
a little differently. That's right. And we might hear someone say, oh dam. And that's an

01:45.600 --> 01:52.240
interjection, which basically means, oh no. Right. That's terrible. Yeah. Dam. I can say dam. I

01:52.320 --> 01:57.920
forgot my keys. Dam. We're late for the movie. Okay. So it's an interesting interjection and

01:57.920 --> 02:03.920
we'll also see it in one of our jokes. And now let's move on to our last word. Nostrils.

02:04.640 --> 02:11.440
Okay. Nostrils. Nostrils. So a nostril or your nostrils. The two holes in your nose. Right.

02:11.440 --> 02:17.200
You breathe through your nostrils. All right. So now that we've taken a look at these three words,

02:17.200 --> 02:21.520
why don't we listen to our comedian for the first time and then we'll come back and talk a little

02:21.600 --> 02:33.520
bit more. Hello, everyone. And welcome to Open Mike Knight. You're in for a real treat

02:33.520 --> 02:39.280
as we've got a lot of great comics here with us tonight. First up, we have a very funny man

02:39.280 --> 02:47.920
coming straight from the state of Montana. Robert Picks. Thank you, everyone. Well, what a lovely

02:47.920 --> 02:54.240
crowd. You know, there's nothing I love better than stand up comedy. You know, I've been working

02:54.240 --> 03:00.240
on my routine for months now and I've got some real singers for you tonight. Let's start out

03:00.240 --> 03:08.800
with some short jokes. How about that? Where do you find a one-legged dog? Where you left it?

03:09.440 --> 03:20.800
Get it? Hmm, anyways. What do you call a sheep with no legs? A cloud?

03:23.200 --> 03:28.800
Tough crowd. All right. Now you're going to love this joke. It's hilarious. What do cows do for

03:28.880 --> 03:43.120
entertainment? They read movies, movies. Okay, okay, okay, we've got a, okay, we've got a few

03:43.120 --> 03:48.560
hecklers in the audience, but this one is good. What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

03:48.880 --> 04:02.560
Day home. Okay, okay, okay, okay, last one. Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

04:04.160 --> 04:14.240
Because they got big fingers. They got big fingers. Thanks, everyone. That was my time.

04:19.440 --> 04:25.280
Okay, so some pretty hilarious jokes, huh? I don't think the crowd really enjoyed them all that much.

04:25.280 --> 04:30.160
Okay, well, maybe I'm just a fan of really terrible jokes. Well, they were pretty funny,

04:30.160 --> 04:34.480
but I guess the crowd just didn't appreciate his sense of humor. But you know what? They did

04:34.480 --> 04:39.200
use quite a lot of really interesting language. So why don't we look at that now in language takeaway?

04:41.040 --> 04:46.560
Language takeaway. On language takeaway, we're going to be looking at six words today,

04:46.560 --> 04:52.240
so let's get started. The announcer welcomed everyone and said that it's open mic night.

04:52.240 --> 04:58.640
Open mic night. So an open mic night. Okay, well, we know mic is short for microphone, right?

04:58.640 --> 05:04.480
Now an open mic night is a chance or anyone can come up in talking to the microphone.

05:04.480 --> 05:09.760
So you can come up and sing or you can tell jokes, you can do anything basically. Yeah.

05:09.760 --> 05:14.720
All right, open mic. So it's not for professionals, but for people who maybe want to be professionals.

05:14.800 --> 05:20.800
Right, amateurs. So it was open mic night and he said they had a lot of great comics there.

05:20.800 --> 05:28.960
So comics. A comic. A comic. So basically a comic is a person that makes a living by making people

05:28.960 --> 05:34.640
out. Yeah, someone who who stands up on stage and tells jokes. All right. Would you say a clown is kind of like a

05:34.640 --> 05:41.280
comic? No, the different. The different. A comic doesn't wear a red nose and a crazy costume.

05:41.280 --> 05:47.520
Yeah. All right. Yeah, because I hate clowns. We do know that. All right. So a comic and what

05:47.520 --> 05:53.760
comics do is they perform a stand-up comedy. Stand-up comedy. Stand-up comedy. Stand-up comedy.

05:53.760 --> 06:00.640
Okay, so stand-up comedy is really exactly what its name suggests, right? Right. You stand up in

06:00.640 --> 06:05.840
front of an audience and you tell jokes or you make them laugh. Yeah, tell funny stories.

06:05.840 --> 06:10.560
It's a very popular form of entertainment in the United States and the UK.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.400
That's right. And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the end of the lesson.

06:14.400 --> 06:21.040
But why don't we move on to our next word, which is routine. A routine. So the guy says I've been

06:21.040 --> 06:29.600
working on my routine. So what does he mean by his routine? Well, I guess a routine is like a series

06:29.600 --> 06:36.240
or a collection of jokes or maybe movements that you use in a performance. All right. A routine.

06:36.240 --> 06:42.720
So you can talk about a dance routine or in this case a comedy routine. So the series of jokes

06:42.720 --> 06:46.880
he's going to tell. That's right. That he practices again and again and again and again. All right.

06:46.880 --> 06:54.080
And in his routine he said he's got a lot of singers. Zingers. A singer. So what's a singer?

06:54.080 --> 07:00.000
Basically a singer is like a strong maybe a little bit rude joke. Yeah, but like a kind of a

07:00.000 --> 07:06.240
one-line joke, right? Exactly. Yeah. And the people that were in the crowd and they were booing

07:06.240 --> 07:11.760
and they were like boo, those we call hecklers. Exactly. And that's our last word, a heckler.

07:11.760 --> 07:17.040
A heckler. Heckler is a. So let's listen to some hecklers in action.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.600
All right. Well, I think that's pretty clear. Those are definitely hecklers. Right. They're very annoying.

07:30.160 --> 07:35.040
So now that we've finished looking at all the words that are related to comedy and performances,

07:35.760 --> 07:43.840
let's take a look at the jokes now in fluency builder fluency builder. Okay. Well, we're not really

07:43.840 --> 07:49.280
focusing on on new phrases for you here, but we thought it would be helpful to talk a little bit

07:49.280 --> 07:53.440
about the jokes to help you understand that, right? Because they are well, I think pretty funny.

07:53.440 --> 07:58.320
Yeah, they're pretty funny, but maybe sometimes they're kind of hard to understand.

07:58.400 --> 08:03.200
So why don't we start with the first joke? So you said, where do you find a one-legged dog?

08:03.200 --> 08:07.440
So what's a one-legged dog? Basically, it's a dog that has one leg.

08:07.440 --> 08:12.400
Okay. And the pronunciation here is important, right? One leg is not one leg, duh. No.

08:12.400 --> 08:18.160
One leg-ed. So you can say a one-legged dog, a two-legged dog, or three-legged dog.

08:18.160 --> 08:25.840
Six-legged dog? A six-legged spider, maybe lost two legs in a war. Oh dear. Okay. So the dog obviously didn't

08:25.840 --> 08:31.360
go anywhere, so that's why you find it, where you left it. Exactly. So that's why it's kind of funny.

08:31.360 --> 08:36.000
Okay. All right. So then he said, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

08:36.720 --> 08:42.720
I don't know. It cloud, basically because, you know, sheep are fluffy and they're white, so if you

08:42.720 --> 08:49.280
take away their legs, they look like a little cloud. Boo! All right. Let's look at the next one.

08:49.360 --> 08:57.280
He asked, what do cows do for entertainment? And then the answer was, they rent movies. Exactly.

08:57.280 --> 09:03.840
So it's kind of funny because he's relating this word movies with what the sound that

09:03.840 --> 09:09.600
cows make, which is mou. Right. And actually, there are a million jokes in English

09:09.600 --> 09:13.840
following the same pattern, right? Yeah, exactly. So I'm sure you can find a lot more of them,

09:13.840 --> 09:18.560
and you can share them with us. Now my personal favorite joke is the guy says,

09:18.560 --> 09:24.160
what does a fish say when it runs into a wall? So to run into a wall basically is to crash against

09:24.160 --> 09:29.600
the wall. Yep. So what does a fish say? Damn. So what, why is this funny? Why is this a dam?

09:29.600 --> 09:34.160
Well, because I mean, if you, if you're a person and you run into a wall, you damn, like,

09:34.160 --> 09:40.560
that, you know, just like, oh no, yeah. But a fish is swimming under the water. And like we saw,

09:40.560 --> 09:46.080
a dam is actually like a wall in the water. So he's saying like, uh, a wall. Yeah. Yeah.

09:46.240 --> 09:52.320
So it's that I like that one. All right. The last one was pretty good. Why do gorillas have big

09:52.320 --> 09:58.160
nostrils? Okay. So the big poles in their nose. Right. And basically it's because they have

09:58.160 --> 10:02.960
big fingers. So they can put their fingers in the nose? Yeah, exactly. How do you? If the gorilla

10:02.960 --> 10:07.200
didn't have big nostrils, he wouldn't be able to pick his nose. Maybe he'd have to use a stick.

10:07.200 --> 10:12.000
Yeah. But that wouldn't be convenient, see? All right. So that's why those jokes are funny.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.680
They're very short jokes. Some, of course, some of them are not actually really funny. But

10:16.480 --> 10:21.760
it's just a little bit of a taste of short American jokes. Okay. Well, I think we need to

10:21.760 --> 10:28.400
hear them one more time in contact. So, um, you can all know how funny or maybe not so funny. They are.

10:34.960 --> 10:40.480
Hello, everyone. And welcome to Open Mike Night. You're in for a real treat. As we've got

10:40.480 --> 10:46.000

10:46.000 --> 10:54.480
from the state of Montana. Robert Picks. Thank you, everyone. Well, what a lovely crowd.

10:55.040 --> 11:00.640

11:00.640 --> 11:06.320
routine for months now. And I've got some real singers for you tonight. Let's start out

11:06.400 --> 11:11.040
with some short jokes. How about that? Where do you find a one-legged dog?

11:13.760 --> 11:24.240
Where you left it? Get it? Anyways, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

11:26.240 --> 11:33.600
A cloud. Oh, tough crowd. All right. Now you're going to love this joke. It's hilarious. What

11:33.600 --> 11:48.320
do cows do for entertainment? They read movies, movies. Okay, okay, okay, we've got a, okay, we've got a,

11:48.320 --> 11:54.640
okay, we've got a few hecklers in the audience, but this one is good. What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

11:54.960 --> 12:08.720
Day home. Okay, okay, okay, okay, last one. Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

12:10.240 --> 12:20.320
Because they got big fingers. They got big fingers. Thanks, everyone. That was my time.

12:25.280 --> 12:32.800

12:32.800 --> 12:38.400

12:38.400 --> 12:44.080
by the way. No, no, no, no swears. It's no swearing in the jokes. Yep. All right, so we'll see you guys there

12:44.080 --> 12:49.040
and until next time. Thanks for listening and goodbye. Bye.
