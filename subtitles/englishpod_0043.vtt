00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.200
And I'm Erica.

00:07.200 --> 00:10.800
And today we're going to be talking about a very special topic.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.600
That's right, this topic was actually suggested by one of our listeners.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.400
Exactly, so keep those comments coming because we want to create lessons that you need that you want.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.400
Exactly.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.400
So what are we talking about today?

00:23.400 --> 00:26.600
Today's lesson is about applying for a visa.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.800
A very, very important topic.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.000
And specifically, it's about visa interview.

00:33.000 --> 00:33.600
Exactly.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.600
As you all probably know, when you apply for a visa, especially for the US, you have an interview.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.400
Yes.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.000
Where you have to answer some questions.

00:41.000 --> 00:41.600
Yes.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.200
And that's what we're going to be talking about today.

00:43.200 --> 00:48.600
So before we jump into the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.200
The vocabulary preview.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.800
Okay, so let's talk about visa.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.400
Right.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.200
A visa.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.400
It's not a credit card.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.000
No, not visa or massacre.

00:58.800 --> 01:06.000
So a visa is an official document that you get in your passport that allows you to travel legally to a country.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Exactly.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.600
So with this document, you can go into a country.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.000
Okay, so we have different types of visas.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.200
Today, we're going to be talking about a B2 visa.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.000
Right.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.400
A B2 visa is a tourist visa.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.600
A tourist visa.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.200
This is only for the United States.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.600
Other countries may have different classifications for their visas, but B2 is for the United States.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.200
Right.

01:27.200 --> 01:32.600
So Marco, we use a tourist visa when we want to be a tourist and just travel in the US.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.400
What about a resident visa?

01:34.400 --> 01:39.800
Well, you can have a temporary resident visa, like for example, an F1.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
Yep.

01:40.800 --> 01:48.800
And F1 is for foreign exchange students who go and live in the States maybe for a year or do a MBA for two years or three years.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.000
So that's an F1 visa.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.600
You can also get a J1 visa, which is a temporary exchange visitor.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.600
Okay.

01:57.600 --> 02:02.400
So it could be to maybe do some temporary work for two or three months and then go back to your country.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.600
So basically a resident visa allows you to live in that country.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.600
Yeah, you can live in that country legally for a determined time.

02:09.600 --> 02:10.600
Okay.

02:10.600 --> 02:11.600
So let's listen to our dialogue.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.600
Where are we going to be exactly?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.600
In this dialogue, we're going to hear two people.

02:14.600 --> 02:18.600
A visa officer and a person who's applying for the visa.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.600
Now, the person who's applying for the visa has an accent, right?

02:22.600 --> 02:23.600
Yes.

02:23.600 --> 02:28.600
This is really good practice for helping you to understand people with different accents.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.600
Exactly.

02:29.600 --> 02:45.600
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all the great vocabulary.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.600
So you're applying for a B2 visa, where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the States?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.600
I'm going to visit my brother.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.600
He's just had a baby.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.600
He lives in Minneapolis.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.600
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

02:59.600 --> 03:02.600
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.600
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.600
And who's sponsoring your trip?

03:10.600 --> 03:11.600
My brother.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
Here.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.600
This is an invitation letter from him.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.600
I will stay with him and he's family in their home.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.600
All right.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.600
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.600
Well, I own a house.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.600
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.600
I have a car at home.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.600
I know my job.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.600
I'm employed by Tornell as an engineer.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.600
Actually, I only have three week vacation.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.600
So I have to go back to work at the end of March.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.600
What evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

03:41.600 --> 03:43.600
Well, I do have assets in my country.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.600
Like I said, I own a house and see.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.600
Here's a bank statement showing my investments.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.600
My bank balance.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
I'm sorry, sir.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.600
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.600
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
Congratulations.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.600
You are the millionth person to apply for visa.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.600
You win!

04:01.600 --> 04:03.600
Congratulations!

04:08.600 --> 04:09.600
All right.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600
What a lucky guy.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.600
He applied for a tourist visa.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.600
And now he's getting a resident visa.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.600
Yeah.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.600
That's great.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.600
But does this really happen?

04:17.600 --> 04:18.600
No.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.600
No, no.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.600
That would never happen at a consulate.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.600
Okay.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.600
Well, we can dream that this might happen for us.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.600
Yeah, exactly.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.600
All right.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.600
Let's take a look at the words in language takeaway today.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.600
Language takeaway.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.600
All right.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.600
On language takeaway, we have sponsoring.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.600
Sponsoring.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.600
Sponsoring.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.600
Sponsoring.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.600
So Erica, what does it mean to sponsor somebody?

04:43.600 --> 04:47.600
When you sponsor somebody for a visa, you take care of them.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.600
And make sure they have enough money.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.600
Okay.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.600
So you are the one who's responsible for all of their expenses.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.600
And making sure they just have enough money.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.600
Okay.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.600
So for example, when I was 16, I made a trip to another country.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.600
Yep.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
And my parents were my sponsors.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.600
So they took responsibility for your money.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.600
Exactly.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
Okay.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
Let's look at our next word.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.600
Invitation letter.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.600
Invitation letter.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.600
Invitation letter.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.600
Invitation letter.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.600
Now, this is a really important part for a visa application.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.600
Yes.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
Very important.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.600
What is an invitation letter?

05:21.600 --> 05:27.600
Well, an invitation letter is a formal letter that a friend or a relative or maybe a business

05:27.600 --> 05:31.600
writes to ask you to come to their country.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.600
Exactly.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.600
So you're being invited for a specific purpose to the United States.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.600
Yeah.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.600
And you have to give this letter to the visa officer.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.600
Okay.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
Invitation letter.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.600
Our next word.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
Ties.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
Ties.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.600
Ties.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
Ties.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
Looks exactly like a tie.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
Like the one you wear in your suit.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.600
Not quite the same, though.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
All right.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.600
So what are ties?

05:55.600 --> 06:01.600
The ties you have to your country are the things that keep you attached to your country.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.600
Okay.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.600
That make sure that you will return to your country.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.600
Okay.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.600
So what are some examples of ties?

06:07.600 --> 06:13.600
Like maybe a house or a wife or a child or maybe some money in your bank account.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.600
Okay.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.600
Or a job, even.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.600
Okay.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
Okay.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.600
Perfect.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.600
Yeah.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.600
A good way to think of this is imagine like a rope that's attached to you and tying you to

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
your country, to your house, to your job, to your kids.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
Okay.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
So you can't run away.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.600
Exactly.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
Okay.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.600
Okay.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.600
That was clear.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.600
But let's listen to some more examples of how we would use ties.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.600
Example one.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.600
I sold my house and closed my bank account.

06:40.600 --> 06:46.600
I don't have any more ties to my home country.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.600
Example two.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.600
Alvin enjoyed being single.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.600
He wasn't ready for the ties of family life.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.600
Example three.

07:00.600 --> 07:08.600
Diplomatic relations have improved and the ties between the two countries are stronger.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.600
All right.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.600
Let's look at our next word financially independent.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600
Financially independent.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.600
Financially independent.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.600
Financially independent.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.600
So that means that you don't need anyone that you have enough money.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.600
You have enough money for yourself.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.600
Right.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.600
So you don't have to ask your parents to pay for your ticket or pay for your food or whatever.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.600
Okay.

07:31.600 --> 07:36.600
And our last word for today assets assets assets assets.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.600
Okay.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.600
So your assets are kind of like your ties.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.600
Right.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.600
There are things of value that you own.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.600
Things that are expensive that you own in your home country.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.600
So it would be a house, a car.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.600
Yeah.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.600
Maybe stocks, stocks, investments.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
Okay.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.600
So all of those things are your assets.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.600
Okay.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.600
So we've seen a lot of great words.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.600
And I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.600
We're going to slow it down for you.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.600
Yeah.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.600
This will help you understand it a little bit better.

08:06.600 --> 08:15.600
So you're applying for a B2 visa.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.600
Where is your final destination?

08:17.600 --> 08:21.600
And what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.600
I'm going to visit my brother.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.600
He's just had a baby.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.600
He lives in Minneapolis.

08:27.600 --> 08:32.600
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

08:32.600 --> 08:35.600
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.600
See, here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.600
And who is sponsoring your trip?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
My brother.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.600
Here.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.600
This is an invitation letter from him.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.600
I'll stay with him and his family in their home.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
All right.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.600
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.600
Well, I own a house.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.600
Actually, I'm living my dog there with my neighbors.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.600
I have a car at home.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.600
I know my job.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.600
I'm employed by Tornell as an engineer.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.600
Actually, I only have three weeks vacation.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.600
So I have to go back to work at the end of March.

09:18.600 --> 09:23.600
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

09:23.600 --> 09:26.600
Well, I do have assets in my country.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.600
Like I said, I own a house and see,

09:30.600 --> 09:36.600
here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.600
I'm sorry, sir.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.600
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.600
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.600
Congratulations.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.600
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
You win.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.600
Congratulations.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.600
Yay.

10:00.600 --> 10:07.600
Okay, today we're not going to do a regular tool kit,

10:07.600 --> 10:09.600
like Fluency Builder, or putting it together.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.600
No, we're going to do something a little bit different today.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.600
We're going to talk about the questions you will probably be asked

10:14.600 --> 10:17.600
at an interview for a US visa.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.600
Yes.

10:18.600 --> 10:22.600
And the useful language that you can use to answer these questions in a good way.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.600
Okay.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.600
So let's take a look at our first question.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.600
Where is your final destination?

10:27.600 --> 10:32.600
And what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

10:32.600 --> 10:35.600
Where is your final destination?

10:35.600 --> 10:40.600
And what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

10:40.600 --> 10:44.600
So this is probably going to be the first question the interview is going to ask you.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.600
Yeah, so Marco, I know you have a lot of experience with US visas.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.600
How should we answer this question?

10:50.600 --> 10:52.600
Well, it depends on what you're doing, right?

10:52.600 --> 10:56.600
So if you're a tourist, you would say I'm going on vacation to New York or anywhere.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.600
Also, if you're visiting a family member like in our dialogue, you would say,

10:59.600 --> 11:02.600
Oh, I'm going to visit my sister or my brother or my cousin.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.600
If you're applying for a business visa, then you would say, Oh, I'm going to visit a company or

11:06.600 --> 11:07.600
etc.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.600
Right.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.600
So you just have to say why you are going to the state.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.600
Now, is it important to be really specific?

11:13.600 --> 11:15.600
Yeah, the more specific you are, it's probably better.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.600
So if you can name the state and the city where you're going, it's much better.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
Okay.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
All right.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.600
Well, let's listen to our next question.

11:22.600 --> 11:27.600
How long do you plan to remain in the United States?

11:27.600 --> 11:32.600
How long do you plan to remain in the United States?

11:32.600 --> 11:36.600
Okay. So this is a really important question also because in your application,

11:36.600 --> 11:39.600
you have to put how long you plan to stay in the US.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.600
Right.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.600
It's a pretty straightforward answer.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.600
You know, two months, one month, three weeks.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.600
Right.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.600
But you just have to make sure that your answer matches.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.600
What's written in your application?

11:50.600 --> 11:51.600
Yeah.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.600
Okay.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.600
Now let's take a look at our last question.

11:55.600 --> 12:00.600
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.600
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.600
Well, I think this is maybe the most important question that the last key, right?

12:08.600 --> 12:09.600
Yeah.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.600
This is the most important question.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.600
This is what the interviewer is most interested in.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.600
Okay.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.600
So why is he interested in this?

12:16.600 --> 12:23.600
Because he has to be sure that you will not become an illegal immigrant to the United States.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.600
So that you will return to your home country.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.600
Exactly.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.600
Here she has to be convinced that you're going to return to your home country.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.600
So how can you convince him?

12:31.600 --> 12:33.600
Basically by demonstrating your ties.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.600
So showing the things that will pull you back to your home country.

12:36.600 --> 12:41.600
So if you take documents to support this bank statements,

12:41.600 --> 12:43.600
maybe a copy of your mortgage.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.600
Yep.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.600
Maybe you're wedding certificate.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.600
Wedding certificate.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.600
I don't know.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.600
Even a letter from your office from your job.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.600
So the shows that you have to return to your work.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.600
The more things you bring the better,

12:54.600 --> 12:58.600
even though the interviewer might not ask for the documents.

12:58.600 --> 12:59.600
Okay.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.600
Just be it's better to be safe, right?

13:00.600 --> 13:01.600
Exactly.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
So come with a huge file.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
Oh, thanks.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.600
Exactly.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.600
I've had friends who have arrived to the embassy with a huge file of documents

13:07.600 --> 13:10.600
and weren't asked to to show any of the documents.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.600
All right.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.600
But other interviewers will maybe ask for it.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.600
So now let's listen to the dialogue again.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.600
And you'll hear how our traveler answers these questions.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.600
So you're applying for a B2 visa.

13:30.600 --> 13:34.600
Where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?

13:34.600 --> 13:36.600
I'm going to visit my brother.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.600
He's just had a baby.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.600
He lives in Minneapolis.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.600
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

13:43.600 --> 13:46.600
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

13:46.600 --> 13:50.600
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
And who's sponsoring your trip?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
My brother.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.600
Here.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.600
This is an invitation letter from him.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.600
I will stay with him and he's family in their home.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.600
All right.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.600
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.600
Well, I own a house.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.600
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.600
I have a car at home.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.600
I know my job.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.600
I'm employed by Tornell as an engineer.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.600
Actually, I only have three week vacation.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.600
So I have to go back to work at the end of March.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.600
What evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.600
Well, I do have assets in my country.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.600
Like I said, I own a house and see.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.600
Here's a bank statement showing my investments.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.600
And my bank balance.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
I'm sorry, sir.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.600
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.600
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.600
Congratulations.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.600
You are the millionth person to apply for visa.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.600
You win.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.600
Congratulations.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.600
Well, I hope this was a useful lesson for all of our listeners.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.600
Because I'm sure that in one point or another, in the future,

14:59.600 --> 15:01.600
you're going to apply for a visa.

15:02.600 --> 15:07.600
So now you know all the language that you need to more or less answer all these questions that you're going to be asked.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
Yes.

15:08.600 --> 15:12.600
And Marco, I'm sure that people have already applied for visas for the US, right?

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
Probably, yeah.

15:13.600 --> 15:18.600
And I want to hear from our users any stories that they have about applying for a visa.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.600
