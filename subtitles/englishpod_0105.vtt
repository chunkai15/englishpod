00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello English learners. Welcome back to English pod. My name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
And I'm Erica. Today we're bringing you a lesson about the office. So something related to business, right?

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
That's right. And in this lesson, we're learning language you can use to tell someone they did a good job.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Okay, so a job well done. You want to praise somebody.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
So we're going to listen in as a manager praises his employee on a presentation.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
Okay, so before we listen to the dialogue, let's take a look very quickly at vocabulary preview.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Well, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
And the first one is a whiz.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
To be a whiz.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Okay, so it's an adjective somebody is a whiz.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
That's right. And whiz comes from the word whizard.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
Okay, so kind of like a like a whiz is someone who is really good at something.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay, so I can say David is a computer whiz.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Or Anthony is a math whiz.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay, so he's really good at computers or he's really good at math or he knows a lot about math.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Exactly.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Okay, and our second word.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Well, we're going to hear about slides slides.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
PowerPoint slides.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
PowerPoint slides. Okay, so everyone knows PowerPoint, right?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
A computer program.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
A computer program that you use to make presentations.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And a slide is one page in that presentation.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay, so if you have ten pages in your PowerPoint presentation, you basically have ten slides.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Exactly.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Very good.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
So now let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
And we're going to see what's happening in this business meeting.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Thank you very much for your time.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
I've got to say Alex, you really wowed me today.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Ah, come on.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
He was nothing.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm just doing my job.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
No, I think he deserves some recognition here.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Well, Kristen did give me a head of the slides.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
You made some really good points.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Really, you did a great job.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
All right.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
Well, it sounds like the employee is a little bit shy or embarrassed by receiving all of these compliments.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, I guess he's kind of being humble about it.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Exactly.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
So why don't we move on to the language now?

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
There are so many really useful phrases in this dialogue.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
But I think we're just going to focus on those today.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
So let's get started with Fluency Builder.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Fluency Builder.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Okay.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
So today I'm Fluency Builder.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Let's start with our first phrase.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
The boss was so impressed with the presentation that he said,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
I was completely blown away.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
To be completely blown away.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Okay.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
So to be completely blown away.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Or to be blown away.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
All right.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
So what does that mean to be blown away?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
To be surprised and amazed.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
But in a very positive way.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Okay.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
So I can say, I'm surprised.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I'm amazed.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
But I'm still not very clear on this.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Why don't we listen to a couple of examples of how we could use this phrase?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Example one.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
Carled Lumiaway with his knowledge of political science.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Example two.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I was blown away when I heard that Jenny and Rick had gotten married.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
They had known each other for less than a month.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Example three.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
My parents were blown away when they found out I had a tattoo.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Okay.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
So I think that's a little bit clearer now.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
And this is a wonderful way to give your praise to someone when they do something really amazing.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
So completely blown away.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
You blew me away.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
That's right.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Now what about our second word?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Well, it's quite similar.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
The boss said that you really wowed me.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
You wowed me.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
To wow someone.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Okay.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So it spelled W-O-W.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Wow.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
So when you wow someone, you make that person go wow.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Okay.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
So you impress somebody.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yep.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
To wow someone.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I can use it as a verb.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Wowed me.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I want to wow you.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Well, I want you to wow me.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Okay.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
So wow.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Now let's take a look at our third phrase.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
The guy he's a little bit shy.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
He's trying to be a little bit humble about, you know, receiving so many compliments.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
So he says, oh, it was nothing.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
It was nothing.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Really.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
It was nothing.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
It was nothing.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
So that's the way of saying it wasn't hard or it's not a big deal.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
It's not that important.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Exactly.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
So if somebody's saying, wow, thank you so much for lending me your car.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It was nothing.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
It was nothing.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
All right.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
It's a polite way actually to respond to a nice compliment.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Very good.

05:35.000 --> 05:42.000
So before we move on to our next phrase, let's listen to a couple of examples with it was nothing.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Example one.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Thanks for lending me your car this week.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I really appreciate it.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
It's okay, really.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
It was nothing.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Example two.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I can't believe you organized the surprise birthday party.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Thank you so much.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Don't worry about it.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
It was nothing.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Okay.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
So I think that's pretty clear.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Now our final phrase here for fluency builder.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
The employee said that Kristen gave him a hand.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Okay.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
So to give someone a hand.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Give me a hand.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Give me a hand.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Basically to help someone help me or assist me.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Okay.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
So to help someone to give me a hand or let me give you a hand.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
That's right.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
All right.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Very good.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
So great phrases and fluency builder today.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue for the second time.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
We're going to slow it down a little bit so we can catch all these phrases.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
And then we'll come back.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy for next year.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Thank you very much for your time.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
I've got to say Alex, you really wild me today.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Ah, come on.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
It was nothing.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm just doing my job.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
No.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
I think you deserve some recognition here.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Well, Kristen did give me a hand with the slides.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Well, that was some good advice.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
You made some really good points.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Well, I just wanted to say well done.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Really, you did a great job.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Okay.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
So like I said before, there's a lot of really helpful phrases in here.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
And we're going to look at a few more of these and putting it together.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Let's get together.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
So let's start with the first phrase.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
The boss was quite impressed with him.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And he said that was quite the presentation.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
That was quite the presentation.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
All right.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Quite the presentation.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
So this phrase, quite the presentation.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
It means it was good, right?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Mm-hmm.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
It was special.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
It was very good.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yep.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Now we can take the noun presentation out and replace it with any other noun.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
All right.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
So I can say Bob is quite the basketball player.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Mm-hmm.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Why don't we listen now for a few more examples?

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Example one.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I heard you are quite the dancer.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Can you teach me some moves?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Example two.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Carl is quite the ladies man.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
He is very good when it comes to talking to girls.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Example three.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Nancy is quite gifted at math.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
She can solve any math problem you give her.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
So you're saying in a very good way that something is very good.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Or special.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Very special.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
All right.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So the boss was very impressed with the employee.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
And he said, and I saw that you took on board my feedback.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
To take on board my feedback.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Okay.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
So take on board something.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Mm-hmm.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
So here my feedback is my suggestions, right?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Mm-hmm.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
And when you take on board my feedback, you accept my feedback and you use it.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Okay.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
So I can say for example, I want you to take on board my ideas.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Mm-hmm.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Jenny took on board a few of my suggestions.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I was really happy.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Very good.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
So to take on board to accept and use.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
All right.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
So take on board feedback, take on board suggestion, take on board ideas.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Okay.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Very good.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
And we have one more phrase I'm putting it together today.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
To think something through.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
To think it through.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Okay.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
So think it through.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
So here the boss said that he took the time to think through my suggestions.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Mm-hmm.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
So think through.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
What does that mean?

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
To think carefully about all of the details of something.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Okay.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
So to take into consideration all the aspects.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Right.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
So why don't we give an example.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
If you're thinking through a plan, right?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
You don't just think about the end.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Mm-hmm.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
The outcome.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Okay.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
You want to think about all of the small details, the steps in that plan.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Okay.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
So maybe I want to buy a new car, but it's a lot of money.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
You really have to think it through.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
So you have to think carefully about everything that is involved in buying the new car.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
All the money you're going to have to, you know, not spend on parties.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Exactly.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
You have to think it through.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
You have to analyze it very carefully.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
That's right.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
So let's give a few examples of how we can use this phrase.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Hey, Marco.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Have you thought through my suggestions?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I can say you guys are very young.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I think you should think it through before you get married.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Mm-hmm.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Good advice.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Okay.

11:12.000 --> 11:22.000
So three great phrases and why don't we hear them one more time in our dialogue.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Thank you very much for your time.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I've got to say Alex, you really wowed me today.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Nah, come on.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
He was nothing.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I'm just doing my job.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
No, I think he deserves some recognition here.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, Kristen did give me a head of the slides.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You made some really good points.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Really, you did a great job.

12:16.000 --> 12:25.000
Okay, great dialogue and some interesting phrases for giving praise, right?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
That's, I think, very important in the workplace.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah, and, you know, I read recently that something like six out of every ten employees

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
don't get regular praise from their boss.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, it's very important.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
And in some cultures, well, it's not very common to praise or to give positive feedback

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
to their employees.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah, but I think for Western employees, actually, it's really important, and it helps

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
them work harder, the more times they hear job well done.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Yeah, very good.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
So now you have the tools that maybe you can use with your employees or with your friends.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
With your friends.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000

Bye.
