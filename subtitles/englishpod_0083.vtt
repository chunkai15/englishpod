00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.560
My name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we're going to be getting money.

00:11.560 --> 00:17.360
That's right, we're going to have a lesson about the ATM, the ATM or automatic

00:17.360 --> 00:22.800
teller machine. Okay, that's what it stands for, ATM. So we're going to be looking at

00:22.800 --> 00:28.080
the language that you'll probably find in an ATM maybe in the United States or in English

00:28.080 --> 00:32.720
speaking country. That's right, but before we begin, why don't we look at some vocabulary

00:32.720 --> 00:40.400
that we'll hear in the dialogue? Very vocabulary preview. As we mentioned, the ATM or automatic

00:40.400 --> 00:46.240
teller machine is a machine where you get your money, right? Exactly. And also will some people

00:46.240 --> 00:51.360
or in different places, they may call it the bank machine? Yeah, or maybe the cash machine.

00:51.600 --> 00:58.880
Or just a money machine or something. All right, so ATM and now let's take a look at our next

00:58.880 --> 01:06.160
word, local authorities. The local authorities. So local authorities. So what are the local authorities?

01:06.800 --> 01:10.960
Well, basically it's the police. The police. Why do you say local authorities? Okay, well,

01:10.960 --> 01:17.840
authority is the person in charge, right? The boss. So the local authorities are basically the

01:17.840 --> 01:23.440
people who are the boss of this place in that area. Yeah, okay. The police, the local authorities.

01:23.440 --> 01:28.160
So why don't we start now with our dialogue? Why are we talking about local authorities and

01:28.160 --> 01:30.800
ATM machines? I don't know. We got to listen to find out.

01:48.640 --> 01:55.440
I have to get it from the ATM. Hello. Welcome to Universal Bank. Please insert your card into the

01:55.440 --> 02:00.560
slot. I know what I put my card. Stupid machine talking me like I'm an idiot. Please input your

02:00.560 --> 02:07.040
sixth digit. Pinko followed by the pound key. Thank you. Please select an option. Thank you.

02:07.600 --> 02:13.360
You have selected withdrawal. Yeah, yeah. I know what I selected. Just give me my money. Please

02:13.360 --> 02:20.560
type the amount you would like to withdraw. Thank you. You want to transfer.

02:21.440 --> 02:28.400
$10,000 US dollars, too. The World Wildlife Foundation. If this is correct, please press one.

02:28.400 --> 02:34.800
No, no. Stupid machine. What are you doing? No. Confirmed. Thank you for using our bank.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.320
Please remove your card from the slot. Goodbye. No way. What happened? Give me my money.

02:40.400 --> 02:46.960
Danger. Danger. The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked

02:46.960 --> 02:51.600
until the local authorities arrive. Thank you for using our bank. Have a nice day.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.240
No.

02:59.680 --> 03:06.160
All right, so it's not his day today. I think he was very unlucky and I maybe he's going to be in trouble.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.480
I know. And he was on a date. This is probably one of the worst things that can happen to a guy

03:10.480 --> 03:16.160
when he's on a date. All right. Yeah. So, well, we saw some of the language that was related to an

03:16.160 --> 03:21.760
ATM money and banking. So why don't we take a look at that now in a language takeaway?

03:23.760 --> 03:32.320
Language takeaway. All right. So the guy had to insert his card into the slot. Okay. So

03:32.400 --> 03:41.200
slot. All right, slot. And that is an opening, right, or a type of hole, maybe. Yeah. It's a hole that is usually long.

03:41.200 --> 03:47.120
Long and it's like a rectangular hole. Yeah. It's a slot. It's never a circle. Okay. So for

03:47.120 --> 03:53.040
example, when you get mail, the mail mail will put it into your mailbox through the slot. That's right.

03:53.040 --> 04:01.120
Okay. Now, well, and now that he put his card into the slot, he had to input a six digit pin code.

04:01.200 --> 04:06.880
Want to just do both together. Diget and pink code. Yeah. Okay. So a six digit pin code. All right.

04:06.880 --> 04:13.600
Now, we have two words here that are new. Diget. Diget is basically a number between zero and nine.

04:13.600 --> 04:20.720
Okay. So any number between zero and nine is considered a digit. Yes. So 100 is made up of

04:20.720 --> 04:27.600
three digits. Three digits. Okay. And what about pin code? A pin code is your secret number that you

04:27.600 --> 04:34.080
used to take money out. Now, why wouldn't we say password? password is usually letters. Okay.

04:34.080 --> 04:41.200
And pin code is numbers. Exactly. All right. He had to input his six digit pin code. And then

04:41.200 --> 04:48.560
after that, he had to press the pound key. Pound key. Now, this is strange. A pound key. What is that?

04:48.560 --> 04:56.880
Well, you know, on a phone on the bottom right, there's a key or a button that looks like a number

04:57.360 --> 05:02.720
number sign. So kind of like two vertical lines and two horizontal lines. Yeah. Two lines going up and

05:02.720 --> 05:08.320
down. Two lines going across. Okay. So that's called the pound key. Mm-hmm. All right. What about the

05:08.320 --> 05:13.920
other one? It's called the star. The star key. The star key. All right. So after the pin code,

05:13.920 --> 05:21.360
after the pound key, now he's ready to withdraw money. Mm-hmm. So we heard with draw. Okay. So

05:21.360 --> 05:28.960
with draw is is a noun. It's the action of taking money out. Okay. A withdrawal. Oh, withdrawal.

05:28.960 --> 05:35.280
Okay. And two withdrawal. Two withdrawal is just the verb to take out money, right? Exactly.

05:35.280 --> 05:40.000
So we have the noun and the verb. The only difference is an L at the end. Yes. So with draw,

05:40.000 --> 05:47.520
noun and withdraw, verb. Okay. And well, he wanted to withdraw money, but something happened with the

05:47.520 --> 05:54.800
ATM and it turned out that he was going to transfer money. Uh-oh. So transfer. Transfer. Transfer.

05:55.360 --> 06:01.040
Transfer. When you transfer money, you take it from one place and put it in another. Okay. And

06:01.040 --> 06:05.840
usually in banking when you transfer money, you don't really see it, right? Exactly. It's all

06:05.840 --> 06:10.640
electronics. So you just put it from one bank account to another, but you never actually see you this

06:10.640 --> 06:16.800
money. Exactly. So transfer money. Transfer. And now this one also has a verb in a noun, right? Right?

06:16.800 --> 06:23.600
A transfer. And two transfer. Same word. Yeah. Easy. All right. So why don't we listen to our dialogue

06:23.600 --> 06:28.800
for the second time? It's going to be slowed down a little bit. And then we'll come back and look at some

06:28.800 --> 06:29.600
phrases.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.680
Stupid girl making me spend so much money. Now I have to get it from the ATM.

06:42.560 --> 06:47.920
Hello. Welcome to Universal Bank. Please insert your card into the slot.

06:47.920 --> 06:51.760
I know what I put my card. Stupid machine talking me like I'm an idiot.

06:51.760 --> 06:58.080
Please input your sixth digit. Pink code followed by the pound key. Thank you. Please select an

06:58.080 --> 07:04.480
option. Thank you. You have selected withdrawal. Yeah. Yeah. I know what I selected. Just

07:04.480 --> 07:11.280
give me my money. Please type the amount you would like to withdraw. Thank you. You want to transfer.

07:12.160 --> 07:19.920
10,000 US dollars too. The world wildlife foundation. If this is correct, please press one.

07:19.920 --> 07:26.800
No. No. Stupid machine. What are you doing? No. Confirmed. Thank you for using our bank. Please

07:26.800 --> 07:34.560
remove your card from the slot. Goodbye. No way. What happened? Give me my money. Danger. Danger.

07:34.560 --> 07:40.720
The exits have been sealed. And the doors will remain locked until the local authorities arrive.

07:40.720 --> 07:46.240
Thank you for using our bank. Have a nice day. No.

07:51.120 --> 07:56.640
Okay. So that was a little easier to understand. But Marko, there's some interesting phrases here.

07:56.640 --> 08:02.800
Some instructions that you commonly read or hear when you're using a bank machine. So why don't we

08:02.800 --> 08:10.320
take a look at these phrases in fluency builder? Fluency builder. Well, the bank machine told

08:10.320 --> 08:19.600
this guy to insert your card. Insert your card. Insert your card. So this verb to insert to place

08:19.600 --> 08:26.480
inside. Exactly. So what else can we insert? Well, for example, commonly you insert a disk.

08:26.480 --> 08:33.200
Yeah, in your computer. In your computer. Or maybe insert a CD into your CD player.

08:33.200 --> 08:39.360
Our DVD into your DVD player. Yeah. All right. So to insert something to put inside. Yes.

08:39.440 --> 08:47.680
So he had to insert his card into the slot. And then the bank machine asked him to select an

08:47.680 --> 08:54.640
option. Select an option. Select an option. Now, this is a very common phrase that you'll not only

08:54.640 --> 09:00.800
see in 18 years, but basically everywhere, right? Like in computers or the internet or many many

09:00.800 --> 09:06.400
things where you're dealing with machines. So it's an order that says, well, select one of these

09:06.480 --> 09:13.040
choices that you have. Make a choice. Make a choice. Yeah. Select an option. All right. So two simple

09:13.040 --> 09:18.480
phrases, but very useful and also very high frequency, right? Yeah. And you know what, when you use phrases

09:18.480 --> 09:24.000
like these two, it sounds quite professional. Doesn't it? Yeah. A little bit formal. Mm-hmm. Okay.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit

09:28.000 --> 09:40.320
more.

09:40.320 --> 09:44.240
Stupid girl, making me spend so much money. Now I have to get it from the ATM.

09:45.680 --> 09:51.680
Hello. Welcome to Universal Bank. Please insert your card into the slot. I know what I put my card.

09:51.680 --> 09:55.840
Stupid machine talking me like I'm an idiot. Please input your six digit,

09:55.920 --> 10:01.440
pink code followed by the pound key. Thank you. Please select an option. Thank you.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.760
You have selected withdraw. Yeah. Yeah. I know what I selected. Just give me my money. Please

10:07.760 --> 10:14.960
type the amount you would like to withdraw. Thank you. You want to transfer.

10:15.840 --> 10:23.440
10,000 US dollars. Two. The world wildlife foundation. If this is correct, please press one. No,

10:24.320 --> 10:30.000
stupid machine. What are you doing? No. Confirmed. Thank you for using our bank. Please remove your

10:30.000 --> 10:38.240
card from the slot. Goodbye. No way. What happened? Gimme my money. Danger. Danger. The exit

10:38.240 --> 10:44.000
has been sealed. And the doors will remain locked until the local authorities arrive. Thank you for

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
using our bank? Have a nice day. No!

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
All right, Erica. So what about you? Have you ever had any problems with the ATM?

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
I've had more problems than I can count. What have been?

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
Well I think in the last two years I've probably lost about seven bank cards in an ATM.

11:07.000 --> 11:07.840
You get it.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.840
Yes, in the slot.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.080
I leave it in the slot and then walk away from the bank machine

11:12.080 --> 11:14.840
and no bank card.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.680
Well, I think now the ATMs,

11:16.680 --> 11:18.320
because this is a common problem.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.920
Now they have like a little alarm

11:20.920 --> 11:23.760
that when you take out your money and everything,

11:23.760 --> 11:26.560
it just starts beeping and beeping until you take out your card.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.320
Yes, and I like the bank machines

11:28.320 --> 11:30.520
that actually give you your card first

11:30.520 --> 11:32.120
and then give you your money.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.560
Because if they give me my money first,

11:33.560 --> 11:34.560
that's all I want, right?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.480
So I run away with my money and leave my card

11:36.480 --> 11:38.000
in the bank machine.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.480
Right, I think that's a good idea.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.440
I've never seen it before though.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.600
It's what's a land they have that like.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.440
That's right.

11:43.440 --> 11:47.000
What about the ATMs that you only have to swipe your card?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.200
Oh yeah, I've done that as well

11:48.200 --> 11:50.920
and also ruined a bank card with that.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.080
It's liked it too many times,

11:52.080 --> 11:54.720
put in the wrong pin code and it blocks your card.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.400
Yeah, terrible.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.560
Well, what about you guys?

11:57.560 --> 12:00.000
I'm sure everyone has some experience

12:00.000 --> 12:03.040
or some inconvenience with ATMs machines.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.520
