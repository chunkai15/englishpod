00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.800
And I'm Erica.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.100
And today we're back in the office.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.400
We have a lesson that's talking about something that goes wrong in the office.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.900
Yes, something that I can really understand well.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.400
But we'll talk about that later.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.200
So this lesson is about a photocopier.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.200
A photocopier.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.600
So let's take a look at this word in vocabulary preview.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.000
Very cablory preview.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.600
All right, so a photocopier makes copies.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.800
Yeah, it makes copies of documents.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.200
We often call it a copier or a copy machine.

00:38.200 --> 00:38.800
Mm-hmm.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.500
Yeah, so you can call it a photocopier, copy machine, or copyer.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.900
Yes, or zerox machine as well.

00:44.900 --> 00:45.900
Zerox machine.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.600
Yeah, we can talk about that a little bit later.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.900
Because that's an interesting story.

00:48.900 --> 00:49.400
Okay.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.800
All right, let's take a look at our next word.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.800
Toner.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.800
Toner.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.600
Toner.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.600
Toner.

00:55.800 --> 01:00.200
So toner is what the copy machine uses to make copies.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.000
It's like the ink.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Right.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.400
It's a very fine black powder.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.200
So it's not an ink.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.400
No, it's actually dry.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
Okay.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
Yeah, yeah, it's dry.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.200
It's a powder.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.000
So you don't want to get that all over you.

01:14.000 --> 01:14.800
All right.

01:14.800 --> 01:19.000
We'll get advice, Marco, and our last word in vocabulary preview.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.200
Mal function.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.400
Mal function.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
Mal function.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
Mal function.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.600
Let's break down this word.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.200
All right.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.600
Function.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.800
To work.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.800
Uh-huh.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.800
Mal.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.800
I guess Mal maybe comes from Latin or something.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.400
Because in Spanish, we say Mal, which is something evil or not good.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
Okay.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
So I think we can understand.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.400
Mal function is not good working.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.400
Right.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.400
Yeah.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.400
Um.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
Okay.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.400
More or less.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
It's not working properly.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
Not working properly.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
Yeah.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
Okay.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.840
Well, why don't we listen to the dialogue and find out what isn't working properly.

01:53.840 --> 02:05.240
Hey Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me please?

02:05.240 --> 02:10.240
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub branch.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.240
Sure.

02:11.240 --> 02:25.840
I think I broke this thing.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.440
Maxine, can you help me out here?

02:27.440 --> 02:29.840
I'm not really a tech guy.

02:29.840 --> 02:30.840
Yeah, sure.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.640
I think it's just out of toner.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.040
You can go use the other one upstairs.

02:35.040 --> 02:40.040
When you're way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

02:40.040 --> 02:41.040
Sure.

02:41.040 --> 02:47.440
Damn it.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.440
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

02:49.440 --> 02:54.240
I'll send this stupid fax later.

02:54.240 --> 02:58.840
Oh, great.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.440
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

03:00.440 --> 03:02.440
This is ridiculous.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.840
The elevator has some sort of mild function to take the stairs to you.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.040
What's all right, you're going to it?

03:08.040 --> 03:10.040
I have to go up 15 floors.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.240
Never mind.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.840
Made it.

03:22.840 --> 03:24.840
There's a copy here.

03:40.840 --> 03:45.840
OK, so this copy machine is definitely not working properly.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.440
A serious malfunction.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.840
A serious malfunction.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.040
I think the whole building exploded.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.840
All right, very dramatic here at English Pod, but we have fun, right?

03:54.840 --> 03:55.640
Exactly.

03:55.640 --> 04:01.840
OK, let's take a look at some of the great language that we saw in language takeaway.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.440
Language takeaway.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.040
All right, three words for you here in language takeaway.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.040
And we heard all of these in the dialogue.

04:11.040 --> 04:18.440
So this guy needs to get a copy, a sap, a sap, a sap, or a SAP.

04:18.440 --> 04:22.840
Yes, meaning as soon as possible.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.040
So really, really fast.

04:24.040 --> 04:24.840
Really fast.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.040
Yeah, this is a very, very common phrase, right?

04:28.040 --> 04:33.240
So it's an acronym, and you can say it like a sap, or a SAP.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.040
Exactly.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.040
Yeah, usually people say like that because it's too long, I guess,

04:37.040 --> 04:38.240
to say as soon as possible.

04:38.240 --> 04:42.240
So hey, I need this document, a sap, or a SAP.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.240
Exactly.

04:43.240 --> 04:47.040
OK, let's look at our next word, a practical joke.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.640
Practical joke.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.040
Practical joke.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.840
Practical joke.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.240
OK, so a practical joke.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.840
I'm sure we have all played a practical joke on some of our friends, right?

04:57.840 --> 04:58.440
Yes.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.640
Basically what you do is you do something funny on purpose to someone.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.440
Yeah, but something crazy.

05:04.440 --> 05:05.440
Crazy, right?

05:05.440 --> 05:11.440
For example, when I was in university, there was this guy in our building.

05:11.440 --> 05:17.040
And we took all of his bedroom furniture, so his bed, his desk, everything, and put it

05:17.040 --> 05:18.440
down on the football field.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.440
Nice.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.440
Yeah, that was a practical joke.

05:21.440 --> 05:25.440
That is a very good and elaborate practical joke.

05:25.440 --> 05:30.440
OK, so practical joke, do something crazy or funny to your friends.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.440
OK.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.440
And now let's look at our last word.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.440
Never mind.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.240
Never mind.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.240
Never mind.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.240
Never mind.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.240
OK, so if you say never mind, it means.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.240
Don't worry about it.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.240
Don't worry about it.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.240
Forget it or get it.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.240
Yeah.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.240
Never mind.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.240
Yep.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.240
Yeah, this is so common.

05:46.240 --> 05:50.240
And I think it would be helpful to understand how it's used.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.240
So let's hear some examples.

05:53.240 --> 05:57.240
Example one.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.240
Someone stole my wallet.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.240
Oh, wait.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.240
Never mind.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.240
Here it is.

06:05.240 --> 06:10.240
Example two.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.240
Can you get some milk on your way home?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.240
Oh, never mind.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.240
We still have some.

06:18.240 --> 06:23.240
Example three.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.240
The printer's broken?

06:24.240 --> 06:25.240
Never mind.

06:25.240 --> 06:29.240
I'll do this later.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.240
OK, great examples.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.240
And I think our language takeaway is clear.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.240
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time?

06:37.240 --> 06:48.240
And then we'll come back and talk about putting it together.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.240
Hey, Carl.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.240
Can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

06:52.240 --> 06:57.240
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub branch.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.240
Sure.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.240
I think I broke this thing.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.240
Maxine, can you help me out here?

07:02.240 --> 07:04.240
I'm not really a tech guy.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.240
Yeah, sure.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.240
I think it's just out of toner.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.240
You can go use the other one upstairs.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.240
On your way up, can you fix this while I try and fix this thing?

07:13.240 --> 07:14.240
Sure.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.240
Damn it.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.240
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.240
I'll send this stupid facts later.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.240
Oh, great.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.240
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

07:23.240 --> 07:24.240
This is ridiculous.

07:24.240 --> 07:28.240
The elevator has some sort of malfunction to stick to stairs to you.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.240
What's all are you going to?

07:29.240 --> 07:31.240
I have to go up 15 floors.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.240
Never mind.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.240
Made it.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.240
There's a copier.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.240
No!

07:43.240 --> 07:49.240
In this dialogue, there's some great language that can be used in many different patterns or many different ways.

07:49.240 --> 07:55.240
So in today's putting it together, we're going to show you how to use three of these patterns.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.240
Put you in together.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.240
Okay, the first pattern that we can look at is out of toner.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.240
Out of toner.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.240
Right.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.240
So we already talked about toner.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.240
Yep.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.240
Let's talk about out of.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.240
Okay.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.240
So when you are out of you, you have none.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.240
Right.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.240
So let's change a little bit.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.240
So I can say I am out of milk.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.240
Uh-huh.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.240
I'm out of time.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.240
Out of time, right?

08:22.240 --> 08:23.240
Yep.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.240
If you're driving, I'm out of gas and gasoline.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.240
Yep.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.240
Out of plus noun.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.240
Mm-hmm.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.240
Perfect.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.240
It means you don't have none.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.240
You don't have none.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.240
I think it's pod.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.240
Yeah.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.240
You ain't got none.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.240
You bonnicks.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.240
All right.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.240
Out of time.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.240
Let's take a look at our second one.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.240
On your way up.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.240
Yeah.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.240
On your way up.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.240
On your way, right?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.240
Mm-hmm.

08:47.240 --> 08:51.240
So this is a great way when you are talking to someone and they're going somewhere.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.240
Yes.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.240
Right.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.240
So on your way up, can you bring this to HR?

08:56.240 --> 08:57.240
Okay.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.240
On your way to the store.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.240
Can you mail this letter?

09:01.240 --> 09:02.240
Mm-hmm.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.240
Or maybe on your way home.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.240
Can you buy me some flowers?

09:06.240 --> 09:07.240
Mm-hmm.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.240
Nice.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.240
All right.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.240
So on your way, it means...

09:11.240 --> 09:13.240
It means while you are going there.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.240
Right.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.240
Yeah.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.240
Taking advantage of the fact that you are going somewhere.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.240
Yes.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.240
Okay.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.240
Now let's take a look at our last one.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.240
And this is a really great phrase.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.240
Mm-hmm.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.240
Break down.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.240
Break down.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.240
In our dialogue, we heard breaking down.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.240
Yes.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.240
Right.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.240
The everything in the office seems to be breaking down.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.240
Right.

09:30.240 --> 09:33.240
So when something breaks down, it stops working.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.240
It stops working exactly.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.240
So we can change it a little bit.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.240
What happens if we say break up?

09:39.240 --> 09:40.240
Ooh.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.240
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.240
Right.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.240
They end their relationship.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.240
Okay.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.240
So we can maybe think about it as their relationships stops working.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.240
Ah, nice one.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.240
Right.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.240
Okay.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.240
What about break in?

09:51.240 --> 09:52.240
Mm.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.240
Enter a place using force.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.240
Right.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.240
You enter a house that's not yours.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.240
Yeah.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.240
So if you break into a house, maybe you break the window and climb in.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.240
Okay.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.240
What about break out?

10:03.240 --> 10:04.240
So the opposite.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.240
Right.

10:05.240 --> 10:08.240
So for example, you might break out of jail.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.240
Break out of prison.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.240
Yeah.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
So this is a great phrase.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.240
You can change the, you can change the last word from break down.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.240
Break up break in.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.240
Yeah.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.240
And it means different things.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.240
Yeah.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.240
So use different prepositions for different meanings.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.240
Perfect.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.240
Okay.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.240
So now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

10:25.240 --> 10:30.240
And then Erica and I will be back and talk a little bit more about mouth functioning

10:30.240 --> 10:40.240
office supplies.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.240
Hey Carl.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.240
Can you make a copy of this contract for me please?

10:44.240 --> 10:49.240
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub branch.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.240
Sure.

10:50.240 --> 10:55.240
Sure.

10:55.240 --> 11:05.240
I think I broke this thing.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.240
Maxine, can you help me out here?

11:07.240 --> 11:09.240
I'm not really a tech guy.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.240
Yeah.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.240
Sure.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.240
I think it's just out of toner.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.240
You can go use the other one upstairs.

11:14.240 --> 11:19.240
When you're way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

11:19.240 --> 11:26.240
Sure.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.240
Damn it.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.240
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

11:29.240 --> 11:37.240
I'll send this stupid fax later.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.240
Oh great.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.240
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

11:40.240 --> 11:41.240
This is ridiculous.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.240
The elevator has some sort of mouth function.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.240
Just take the stairs to you.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.240
What's all right?

11:46.240 --> 11:47.240
You're going to.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.240
I have to go up 15 floors.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.240
Never mind.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.240
Made it.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.240
There's a copier.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.240
No!

12:17.240 --> 12:21.240
All right.

12:21.240 --> 12:26.240
So Erica, everything that you touch that's electronic seems to malfunction, right?

12:26.240 --> 12:28.240
This is absolutely true.

12:28.240 --> 12:31.240
I don't know what it is, but you know what?

12:31.240 --> 12:36.240
If I turn on a computer, it will suddenly get a virus.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.240
And even if I'm very careful, it still breaks.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.240
Right.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.240
Yeah, it happens sometimes.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.240
I can relate to that.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.240
But you are much better at computers and technology than I am.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.240
Well, I really really like them.

12:49.240 --> 12:53.240
And well, I guess even I know a little bit about copy machines or

12:53.240 --> 12:57.240
copyers because my uncles are like copy technicians.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.240
Really?

12:58.240 --> 12:59.240
Yeah.

12:59.240 --> 13:03.240
So, you know, they fix copiers that broke down or they replace

13:03.240 --> 13:06.240
toner and you know, they do all that stuff.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.240
So that's why you know a little bit about it.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.240
But actually the original term is a zerox machine.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.240
Yes.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.240
Why is that?

13:13.240 --> 13:14.240
From the brand, right?

13:14.240 --> 13:18.240
The brand called Zerox and Zerox invented and patented this

13:18.240 --> 13:20.240
technology of making copies.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.240
All right.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.240
Well, the next time my photocopier explodes.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.240
I'll call you.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.240
I'll call my uncles, right?

13:26.240 --> 13:27.240
All right.

13:27.240 --> 13:31.240
And well, let us know how things in your office break down

13:31.240 --> 13:35.240
or if you have any stories of like Erica that breaks everything

13:35.240 --> 13:36.240
she watches.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.240
It's true.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.240
All right.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.240
