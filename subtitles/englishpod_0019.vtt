Hello English learners and welcome to another lesson with English pod my name is Marco and I'm

00:06.560 --> 00:11.520
Erica and today we're bringing you a great Christmas lesson. That's right we've got a lot of

00:11.840 --> 00:17.280
Christmas vocabulary in today's lesson for you. Yeah it's almost Christmas time so everyone is

00:17.280 --> 00:21.600
getting into the spirit especially here at English pod so we're gonna teach you a little bit more

00:21.600 --> 00:28.080
about this. Speaking of the spirit I think it's time for us to look at our vocabulary preview.

00:28.800 --> 00:34.800
The vocabulary preview. So in this part of our show we'll look at some key language in the

00:34.800 --> 00:40.400
dialogue that you'll need to know to understand the dialogue and actually today we only have one word

00:41.120 --> 00:51.200
Eggnog Eggnog Eggnog EGG and OG Eggnog So Eggnog is a really popular Christmas drink.

00:51.200 --> 00:59.840
It's a traditional Christmas drink. Right what is it made of? Eggs, cream, sugar and usually rum.

00:59.840 --> 01:06.000
Rum. Oh so it has alcohol. Yeah normally it has alcohol. Okay all right that's interesting.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.320
There's actually a drink very similar to this in chili. Really? Yep they call it monkey tail.

01:12.320 --> 01:18.480
So in Spanish that would be gualade mono. Very nice. Yeah so it's actually really really good

01:18.480 --> 01:23.680
men it's really similar to Eggnog. Okay well with that in mind let's take a listen to our dialogue

01:23.680 --> 01:27.120
for the first time.

01:33.680 --> 01:40.320
I hate working on Christmas Eve. Whoa get a load of this guy coming central I think we got our

01:40.320 --> 02:00.160
ourselves a situation here last incident registration please have you been drinking tonight sir?

02:01.120 --> 02:08.320
I had one or two glasses of eggnog but nothing else. Step out of the vehicle please. Sir what

02:08.320 --> 02:14.960
do you have in the back? Just a few Christmas gifts. Two's the season after all. Don't take that

02:14.960 --> 02:22.800
tone with me. Do you have an invoice for these items? Oh no I make these in my workshop and the north

02:23.600 --> 02:29.360
you are under arrest sir you have the right to remain silent you better not power you better not cry.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.920
Anything you say can and we'll be used against you you have the right to an attorney if you can't

02:33.920 --> 02:37.840
afford one the state will appoint one for you. Do you understand these rights that have just been

02:37.840 --> 02:44.320
read to you? You can't take me to jail or in about my sleigh it's Christmas Eve. I have

02:44.320 --> 02:57.280
present still ever. We're the whole. Prens are cancer. Good health.

03:05.360 --> 03:12.640
Well I did not see that one coming. That was interesting Santa Claus is being taken to jail.

03:12.720 --> 03:17.040
What's going to happen next Marco? I don't know. We'll talk about that in a little while let's take a

03:17.040 --> 03:24.720
look at some language from this dialogue. Language takeaway. So the first word that we have on

03:24.720 --> 03:32.480
our language takeaway today is vehicle. Vehicle. Vehicle. Vehicle. So this is a vehicle.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.520
And this is a vehicle.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.760
And this is a vehicle.

03:58.400 --> 04:15.520
So all of those are vehicles. Now I thought that a vehicle was a car specifically.

04:15.520 --> 04:22.320
No any machine that carries people from one place to another is a vehicle. Great. All right let's

04:22.320 --> 04:29.440
take a look now at our second word attorney attorney attorney. So what is an attorney?

04:29.440 --> 04:35.120
Alloyer. Well that's simple enough. Yeah. Alloyer. Let's move to our third word which is

04:35.840 --> 04:44.160
a point. A point. A point. A point. So a point means choose. Okay so the president of a country

04:44.240 --> 04:52.880
might appoint his chief of staff. Right or I can appoint my attorney. True. So can you

04:52.880 --> 05:00.160
appoint a thing? Can I appoint my coffee cup? No no you only use it for people. You choose someone.

05:00.160 --> 05:05.360
Okay I'll choose something. So I appoint someone. Exactly. All right let's move to our final word.

05:05.520 --> 05:13.040
Slay. Slay. Slay. Slay. So Erica you're from Canada you can tell us about slays. All right

05:13.040 --> 05:21.840
a slay is a vehicle that is pulled by a horse and travels over snow or ice. Okay so you know like

05:21.840 --> 05:28.560
Santa drives a sleigh. He drives a sleigh. So do you drive a sleigh or ride a sleigh? Good question.

05:29.520 --> 05:35.120
Well the song says you ride in a one horse opens like. Right okay. Well you know what I think it's

05:35.120 --> 05:40.240
time for us to look at some interesting phrases that we found in this dialogue so let's look at

05:40.240 --> 05:48.320
putting it together. Put it together. Today I'm putting it together we have two great phrases for you

05:48.320 --> 05:55.680
and let's take a look at the first one. Step out. Step out. Step out. So step out means to

05:55.760 --> 06:02.880
go out of a place for a short period of time. Right so in our dialogue for example the police

06:02.880 --> 06:10.320
officer said step out of the vehicle. Get out of your vehicle. You can also say step out of the office.

06:10.320 --> 06:17.840
You can say I just stepped out of the shower. Right now we can also say step in. It's the opposite.

06:17.840 --> 06:25.600
The opposite right. I can ask Marco step into my office for a moment. Oh okay so that's

06:25.760 --> 06:31.440
step out and step in. Great phrases. Let's take a look at our final phrase. Get a load of.

06:31.440 --> 06:39.360
Get a load of. Get a load of. So when I say get a load of something I mean look at. Right. Right.

06:39.360 --> 06:43.920
Look at this guy. Get a load of this guy. Yeah that's what we heard in the dialogue. Now you can use

06:43.920 --> 06:49.520
this phrase in a number of different ways and we have some examples for you. Example one.

06:50.080 --> 07:03.040
Get a load of this. A war is started in an article. Example two. Get a load of that house. It's so big.

07:06.320 --> 07:13.040
Example three. Get a load of him. He's wearing a pink suit.

07:13.360 --> 07:20.640
Okay I think we've covered a lot of interesting words and phrases so we are ready to listen

07:20.640 --> 07:25.760
to our dialogue a second time but this time it's going to be a little bit slower so we can pick up

07:25.760 --> 07:37.440
all these great words. I hate working on Christmas Eve. Whoa get a load of this guy. Come in central.

07:38.080 --> 07:45.680
I think we got ourselves a situation here. License and registration please. Have you been drink

07:45.680 --> 07:55.920
in tonight's serve? I had one or two. License of Agnog but nothing else. Step out of the vehicle please.

07:56.800 --> 08:04.080
Sir what's you having the back? Just a few Christmas gifts. Just the season after all.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.320
Don't take that tone with me. Do you have an invoice for these items?

08:11.040 --> 08:20.320
No I make these in my workshop in the north pole. You are under arrest sir. You have the right

08:20.320 --> 08:26.960
to remain silent. You better not pout. You better not cry. Anything you say can and will be used

08:26.960 --> 08:32.800
against you. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one the state will appoint

08:32.800 --> 08:39.200
one for you. Do you understand all these rights that have just been read to you? You can't take

08:39.200 --> 08:48.080
me to jail. What about my sleigh? It's Christmas Eve. I have presents to deliver. Rudolph,

08:48.080 --> 08:59.200
Prancer, dancer, get help. Okay so we noticed some really great words and phrases and with this now

08:59.280 --> 09:06.560
we can start with some fluency builder. Fluency builder. Today on fluency builder we have two

09:06.560 --> 09:12.160
great phrases that you can use to sound a little bit more natural when you speak. That's right.

09:12.160 --> 09:18.160
Our first phrase you can use if you want to say don't speak to me like that.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.640
Don't take that tone with me. Don't take that tone with me.

09:25.040 --> 09:31.280
So you often hear this phrase coming out of the mouth of a mother or a father.

09:31.280 --> 09:36.160
Yeah, when their children are maybe talking back. Yeah. Don't take that tone with me,

09:36.160 --> 09:44.000
young man. I used to get that a lot. Really? Sorry about that. Okay our second phrase we use it

09:44.000 --> 09:50.240
when we have a problem. The phrase we heard in the dialogue was I think we've got ourselves the

09:51.120 --> 09:57.360
situation here. Let's listen to another example. Houston, we've got ourselves a situation here.

09:59.520 --> 10:06.720
Houston, we've got ourselves a situation here. Sometimes I use this phrase when I want to tell

10:06.720 --> 10:13.920
my boss that I have a problem. I might say boss, I've got a bit of a situation. Can you help me with it?

10:13.920 --> 10:18.240
Okay. Yeah. I have a little bit of a problem. Yeah. Useful phrases, hey?

10:18.320 --> 10:22.960
Really useful phrases. Great stuff. So now we can listen to our dialogue a final time.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.080
And this time we can understand everything that's in it.

10:35.200 --> 10:41.760
I hate working on Christmas Eve. Whoa, get a load of this guy coming central. I think we got

10:41.760 --> 10:43.040
ourselves a situation here.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.760
Come on, come on, come on.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.760
Last incident of registration, please. Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

11:03.120 --> 11:09.680
I had one or two glasses of haynog, but nothing else. Step out of the vehicle, please. Sir,

11:09.680 --> 11:15.760
what do you have in the back? Just a few Christmas gifts. Tis the season after all.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.120
Don't take that tone with me. Do you have an invoice for these items?

11:20.000 --> 11:27.280
Oh, no. I make these in my workshop and the North Pole. You are under arrest, sir. You have

11:27.280 --> 11:32.160
the right to remain silent. You better not power, you better not cry. Anything you say can,

11:32.160 --> 11:36.080
and we'll be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford one,

11:36.080 --> 11:39.840
the state will appoint one for you. Do you understand these rights that have just been read to you?

11:40.480 --> 11:45.440
You can't take me to jail or about my sleigh. It's Christmas Eve.

11:45.440 --> 11:50.240
I have presents to deliver. Ruhal, prancer, dancer. Good help.

12:07.280 --> 12:13.680
So when the police officer was arresting Santa Claus, he said something a little bit strange, hey.

12:13.760 --> 12:18.320
Yeah, you said you better not pout, you better not cry. Now are those part of the normal

12:18.880 --> 12:23.680
rights that a police officer reads? No, no. They're not part of the normal rights,

12:23.680 --> 12:27.360
but it's actually from a Christmas song, so let's listen to how it goes in the song.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.320
I'm pretty happy we had a song to play there instead of us having the same.

12:49.200 --> 12:54.080
But that's great because if the children cry or if they are not good kids,

12:54.080 --> 13:00.160
then Santa Claus will not give them presents. Uh-oh. So that's why. Okay, listeners. I hope that

13:00.160 --> 13:06.880
you're not pouting. I hope you're not crying, but it's time for us to go. So be sure to go to our

13:06.880 --> 13:13.680
website at EnglishPod.com and be sure to leave all your questions in comments and maybe

13:13.680 --> 13:27.120
some of your Christmas stories. All right, thanks for listening and until next time. Bye bye.
