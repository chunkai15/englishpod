00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marko, and I'm Erica, and we're bringing you another great elementary lesson for all those elementary learners.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
In today's lesson we've got some excellent language that will help you to describe someone's appearance.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
It's something that everyone has learned before in school, describing people, so we're going to review that and give you some better phrases.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Some real English phrases.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Real English phrases.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
Okay great, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and then we'll come back and talk about it.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
I heard you were in a day-less night, so how did it go?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
I went all the juicy details.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Um, well, actually we had a fantastic time last night.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
He was amazing.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay, now you really have to fill me in.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
What's he like?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
He's really good looking.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
He's quite tall around 6-1.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
He's in his early 30s, and he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
He sounds hot!

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
What does he do for a living?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
You know what?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
This is the best part.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, so he's got a great career path ahead of him.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Hold on a sec, his name is David.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yeah?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
That's my brother!

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Alright, so interesting dialogue.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Small world.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
It is a small world.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
I don't know how I would feel about dating my friend's brother.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Really?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
No, I wouldn't feel good about it.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Why?

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
Because if you break up with the brother, then like, that means you'll have to end the friendship with your best friend.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Maybe.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
David's.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Girls are more complicated with that.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
We, guys, we're not that complicated.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, um, you know what?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Let's look at the language before this gets too far.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Alright, let's take a look at language takeaway.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Language takeaway.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I language takeaway today.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
We're bringing you three words.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
The first one is herd herd herd herd.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
So you guys know this word.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Past tense of here, right?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Right.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
But the way it's used is quite interesting.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Mm-hmm.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Let's listen to a couple of examples of how it's used.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Example one.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I heard you're dating a new guy.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Example two.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Julie told me she heard that you're pregnant.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Example three.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
What? You got fired? I heard that you quit.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
So when you say for example, oh, I heard you were pregnant.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Whoa.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
This is like telling someone that you've found some information about them,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
but you're not sure if it's true or if it's false.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Okay.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Our next word.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Fill me in.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Fill me in.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Fill me in.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Fill me in.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
So when you tell someone to fill you in,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
you're saying tell me about it.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Tell me the details.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Uh-huh.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I could say, I'm sorry I was late for the meeting.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Can you fill me in on what happened?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Exactly.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Or I could say, I missed the first five minutes of the movie.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Fill me in.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Exactly.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Okay. Great word.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
And our last phrase today.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Career path.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Career path.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Career path.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Career path.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Career path.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
So what's a career path?

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
I guess this is the plan for your job over several like 10 or 20 years.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Right.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
All the different jobs and things you do during your career.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
That's your career path.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
So in this case, David has a really good career path

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
because he's going to be a really rich and powerful investment banker.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
So career path.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Very good.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
So now let's listen to our dialogue again

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
and pay special attention to the language used to describe David

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
because when we come back, we're going to talk about this.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Irene, I heard you were on a date last night.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
So how did it go?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I won all the juicy details.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Um, well, actually.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
We had a fantastic time last night.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
He was amazing.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Okay.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Now you really have to fill me in.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
What's he like?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
He's really good looking.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
He's quite tall around 6-1.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
He's in his early 30s.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
And he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
He sounds hot.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
What does he do for a living?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
You know what?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
This is the best part.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
So he's got a great career path ahead of him.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Hold on a sec.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
His name is David.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
That's my brother.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
So we found some really great words and phrases used to describe someone.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Exactly.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
There's a lot of language in here talking about the way someone looks.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
So let's listen again as Irene describes David.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
He's really good looking.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
He's quite tall around 6-1.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
He's in his early 30s.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
And he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Okay.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
So let's break this down.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
The first thing she says is he's really good looking.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Good looking.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Good looking.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
So good looking is the equivalent of handsome.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Or pretty.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Pretty.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Good looking.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
But I think good looking sounds a lot more natural than that.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I think that's a lot more natural than that.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
But I think that's a lot more natural than that.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
But I think that's a lot more natural than that.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
He's really good looking.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
He's quite tall around 6-1.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
He's in his early 30s.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
And he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
But I think good looking sounds a lot more natural than handsome.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
You wouldn't really use handsome.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I would never say that.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Even though it's correct, it's just good looking sounds much more natural.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I guess for me, whenever someone says handsome,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
it sounds like an older person.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
It sounds old-fashioned.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Exactly.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Exactly.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Okay.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Now let's look at the next thing she's saying.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
He's quite tall.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
White tall.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Quite tall.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Quite tall.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
So we know quite means very.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And tall, we know.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Right.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
So you can describe a person in different ways.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
He's quite tall.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
He's kind of tall.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
He's sort of tall.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
He's a bit short.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
He's not that short.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Okay.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
So these are great words we can use to describe someone's height.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Okay.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Then she talked about his exact height.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yes.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Right.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
She said he was 6-1.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Around 6-1.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
This is interesting because in the United States and Canada,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
you give a person's height using feet and inches.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
That's right.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Right.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
So we don't talk about meters and centimeters.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Right.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
So 6-1 would be 6 feet one inch.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Exactly.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
But in other countries, you would talk about centimeters or meters.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
So 6-1 is like,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
6-1 is about 180.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
But that.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
So this is an interesting difference between,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
like English speaking countries and European countries.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Right.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Okay. So the next time you give your height to someone,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
make sure you do it in feet more or less.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It sounds a lot more natural.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
And actually, if you say to somebody in Canada, for example,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I'm 175 centimeters.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Right.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
They wouldn't know really how tall that is.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Okay.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Now, the next part is really, really useful.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
She said he's in his early 30s.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
In his early 30s.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
His early 30s.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Early 30s.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
So this is a way of describing someone's age without actually

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
getting the exact number.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Exactly.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
So for example, early 30s.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
So like 32, 33,

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
mid 30s.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Like 34, 35,

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
36.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Oh, 36.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And then late 30s would be 38, 39.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
And you could do the same thing for like 40s.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
40s, 50s, 60s.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
20s.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Right.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Starting at 20s, you wouldn't do that.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You wouldn't do this before your 20s.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't think it's really common to talk about your teens.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Right.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You can say like his mid teens or early teens.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Sounds a bit weird.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Okay.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Great language used to describe people.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
But one more word.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Right.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
He's hot.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
He's hot.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Or he sounds hot.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Yeah.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
He's hot.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
So this is another sort of informal way of describing someone

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
who's really good looking.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Good looking.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Really sexy.

09:15.000 --> 09:15.500
Right.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.500
That's a little bit of a horrible boy.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.500
She's hot.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.500
Yeah.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.500
But it is informal.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.500
It is really informal.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
Maybe even a little bit offensive.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
You wouldn't go up to a girl to say, wow, you're hot.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.500
No.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.500
It's a little bit too impolite.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.500
Right.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
You would say, wow, you're really pretty, you're gorgeous.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.500
Yeah.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.500
You wouldn't say, wow.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.500
No.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.500
You would never say that to somebody.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
Right.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.500
That's something you would comment with your friends.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.500
Yeah.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
Okay.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
So we've looked at some really good language for describing people.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
Now we could listen to our dialogue a third time.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
And I'm sure you will understand everything.

09:42.500 --> 09:57.500
I heard you were in a day last night.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
So how did it go?

09:58.500 --> 10:00.500
I went all the juicy details.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
Um, well.

10:02.500 --> 10:06.500
Actually, we had a fantastic time last night.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
He was amazing.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.500
Okay.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.500
Now you really have to fill me in.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.500
What's he like?

10:12.500 --> 10:13.500
He's really good looking.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.500
He's quite tall around 6-1.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.500
He's in his early 30s.

10:17.500 --> 10:21.500
He's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.500
He sounds hot.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.500
What does he do for a living?

10:25.500 --> 10:26.500
You know what?

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
This is the best part.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.500
David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.500
So he's got a great career path ahead of him.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
Hold on a sec.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.500
His name is David?

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
Yeah.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.500
That's my brother!

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
Okay.

10:43.500 --> 10:49.500
So we looked at really useful language for describing people.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.500
And we want you to describe your girlfriend, boyfriend, or even yourself.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
Or even yourself.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.500
What do you look like?

10:55.500 --> 10:56.500
How tall are you?

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
How old are you?

10:57.500 --> 10:58.500
Yeah.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.500
And try and use the language from today's lesson.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
Right.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.500
So come to EnglishPod.com and leave your questions and comments on our website.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.500

Yep.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.500
And we'll definitely be there to answer any doubts as well.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.500
Yes.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.500
Well guys, thanks for listening today.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
