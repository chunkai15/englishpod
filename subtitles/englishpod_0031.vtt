00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Hello English learners, welcome back to English Pod, my name is Marco.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.600
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about appointments.

00:09.600 --> 00:14.800
That's right, we've got an elementary lesson about canceling and appointment.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.280
It's a really common situation sometimes.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.760
You have an appointment at the doctors or something.

00:19.760 --> 00:20.800
Or at work.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.080
And you have to cancel it.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.720
Yes, so we're going to learn some great language to help you cancel appointments today.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.640
Let's go straight to the dialogue then.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.040
We're going to be listening as Samantha and Angela have a phone conversation,

00:33.040 --> 00:36.080
and Angela is trying to cancel an appointment.

00:36.080 --> 00:39.680
And it's going to be a little bit fast in the beginning, but when we come back,

00:39.680 --> 00:41.760
we will explain all the great vocabulary.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.760
Hi Samantha, this is Angela Calling.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.520
Oh hi Angela, what's up?

00:59.520 --> 01:02.160
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.320
I wonder is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

01:06.320 --> 01:10.000
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.040
Let me see.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.800
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.320
I'm really sorry.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.960
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.200
It's just this thing came up and...

01:19.200 --> 01:21.920
Angela, you know what, I can't make it to our meeting either.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.960
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.960
Sounds great, see you tomorrow.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.520
Angela, Angela, look up.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.400
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

01:34.400 --> 01:35.760
Isn't that Samantha?

01:35.760 --> 01:36.880
What?

01:36.880 --> 01:39.840
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.600
Oh no, I think she saw me.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.560
Okay, we have some really interesting words that you probably listened to in this dialogue,

01:50.560 --> 01:52.800
so let's start with language takeaway.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.360
Language takeaway.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.960
Today on language takeaway, we're bringing you three words.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.320
Uh, Erica, what's the first one?

02:00.320 --> 02:03.200
The first word is reschedule.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.320
Reschedule.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.600
Reschedule.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.120
Reschedule.

02:07.120 --> 02:12.160
When you reschedule an appointment, you change it for another day or time.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.360
Exactly.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.720
Great, the second word that we have is inconvenience.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.320
In convenience.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.520
In convenience.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.360
In convenience.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.840
So to inconvenience, someone is to...

02:23.840 --> 02:27.760
To make things not convenient for that person.

02:27.760 --> 02:32.240
So to make things a little bit difficult to make things a little bit uncomfortable.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.520
A little comfortable.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.800
In convenience.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.960
And our third word is...

02:36.960 --> 02:37.920
Puzzpone.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.280
Puzzpone.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.480
Puzzpone.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.280
Puzzpone.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.760
We have some examples of the word postpone.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.640
That will help you to understand it's meaning a little bit better.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.200
Let's listen.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.040
Example one.

02:49.120 --> 02:54.080
Since Robert is late again, we have to postpone the meeting.

02:57.920 --> 02:58.720
Example two.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.520
I'm sorry Simon, but your vacation has been postponed until next month.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.080
Example three.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.880
Unfortunately, the flight will be postponed.

03:15.440 --> 03:20.560
Okay, so basically postpone is to delay.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.440
That's right.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.720
Make it at a later time.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.440
At a later time.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.080
Okay, some great words there.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.920
And we can listen to our dialogue a second time at a slower speed.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.640
Hello, Samantha speaking.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.880
Hi Samantha.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.320
This is Angela calling.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.160
Hi Angela.

03:46.160 --> 03:46.640
What's up?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.920
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

03:50.480 --> 03:55.440
I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

03:56.240 --> 04:00.000
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.640
Let me see, it shouldn't be too much of a problem.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.560
I'm really sorry.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.000
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.960
It's just this thing came up in.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.360
Angela, you know what?

04:15.360 --> 04:17.360
I can't make it to our meeting either.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.800
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon?

04:20.800 --> 04:23.360
At the same time, sounds great.

04:23.920 --> 04:24.960
See you tomorrow.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.960
Angela, Angela, look up.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.960
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

04:33.680 --> 04:34.880
Isn't that Samantha?

04:35.840 --> 04:36.240
What?

04:37.280 --> 04:40.560
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.000
Oh no!

04:42.560 --> 04:44.160
I think she saw me.

04:50.800 --> 04:55.360
Alright, so in this dialogue we had some really great phrases that we should look at in fluency builder.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.520
Fluency builder.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.320
We have three phrases for you today in fluency builder.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.600
And the first one is so common, it's a great phrase.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.200
What's up?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.080
What's up?

05:06.080 --> 05:06.720
What's up?

05:08.240 --> 05:10.320
So this is a very common way of saying,

05:10.400 --> 05:11.040
Hi.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.160
Yeah, what's up?

05:12.160 --> 05:12.880
How's it going?

05:12.880 --> 05:13.760
What's going on?

05:13.760 --> 05:14.160
Right.

05:14.160 --> 05:18.320
And now the interesting thing is that many people don't know how to answer this phrase.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.480
Yes, I see that's all the time with my students.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.480
So if you say what's up, you should say,

05:22.480 --> 05:23.200
No much.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.080
Not much.

05:24.080 --> 05:24.640
Nothing.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.360
Nothing.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.160
So what's up?

05:26.160 --> 05:26.960
Not much.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.680
Not much.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.360
Alright, so the next time someone tells you what's up,

05:31.360 --> 05:32.480
now you know what to answer.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.280
Yeah.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.040
Okay, our second phrase is,

05:35.600 --> 05:36.640
can't make it.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.080
Can't make it.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.440
I can't make it.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.360
We use this phrase when we want to say,

05:41.360 --> 05:42.800
I cannot attend.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.760
I cannot make it.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.120
Yeah, I can't come.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.600
Right, so if you're having a party today,

05:47.600 --> 05:49.280
I say, oh, I'm sorry, I can't make it.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.080
Mm-hmm.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.200
I mean, I can't go.

05:51.200 --> 05:51.760
Exactly.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.280
Maybe one more example.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.520
So Marko, we've got a meeting today at three o'clock.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.280
I can't make it.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.320
I'm recording today.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.160
Oh, okay.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.680
So can't make it.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.080
Our last word for Fluency Builder.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.440
This thing came up.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.640
This thing came up.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.880
This thing came up.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.280
This is a great way of giving an excuse

06:11.280 --> 06:13.280
or why you can't make it.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.160
Right.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.640
So I can't make it today because

06:16.640 --> 06:17.520
this thing came up.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.800
Like something...

06:18.800 --> 06:19.520
Something happened.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.320
Something happened.

06:20.320 --> 06:20.880
Yeah.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.040
Let's listen to a few examples of this phrase.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.760
So we can see how it's used in the wild.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.720
Example one.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.520
I'm sorry that I'm late.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.720
This thing came up at work.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.240
I had to stage take care of it.

06:35.680 --> 06:36.480
Example two.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.920
I can't talk right now.

06:39.920 --> 06:40.640
Something came up.

06:43.680 --> 06:44.800
Example three.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.400
Sorry, I missed the meeting.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.200
Something came up.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.120
Okay, great example.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.960
And I guess it's perfectly clear now.

06:54.960 --> 06:55.840
Yes.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.000
So let's listen to our dialogue a third time

06:58.000 --> 06:59.920
and now we're ready to understand everything.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.000
Hello, Samantha speaking.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.120
Hi Samantha.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.560
This is Angela calling.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.240
Oh hi Angela, what's up?

07:14.240 --> 07:16.240
I'm just calling about our meeting today.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.480
I wonder is it possible to

07:18.480 --> 07:20.960
reschedule our appointment in the afternoon?

07:20.960 --> 07:23.840
I have a bit of an emergency that I need to take care of.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.680
Let me see.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.440
You shouldn't be too much of a problem.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.040
I'm really sorry.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.680
I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.920
It's just this thing came up and...

07:34.000 --> 07:34.960
Angela, you know what?

07:34.960 --> 07:36.640
I can't make it to our meeting either.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.680
Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?

07:39.680 --> 07:41.360
Sounds great. See you tomorrow.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.320
Angela, Angela, look up.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.200
See that lady over there who's trying on a red leather jacket?

07:49.200 --> 07:50.640
Isn't that Samantha?

07:50.640 --> 07:51.840
What?

07:51.840 --> 07:54.640
No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.320
Oh no, I think she saw me.

07:57.280 --> 08:06.160
So, Eric, have you ever canceled an appointment like this under false pretenses?

08:06.880 --> 08:09.440
So, for a fake reason?

08:09.440 --> 08:11.760
For a fake reason to go shopping?

08:11.760 --> 08:17.840
Um, well, I may not have, you know, told my boss so I can't make it to a meeting because

08:17.840 --> 08:21.600
this thing came up and then I really was going shopping and I've never done that.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.800
But how about you, Marco?

08:22.800 --> 08:25.600
Well, you know, in Ecuador, soccer is a really big thing.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.160
Right.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.320
So, um, when we were playing in the world cup, Ecuador was playing and...

08:30.320 --> 08:31.280
Not you, but...

08:31.280 --> 08:34.160
Well, no, like, yeah, the Ecuadorian soccer team.

08:34.160 --> 08:34.800
Uh-huh.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.000
I canceled an appointment because I was going to go watch the game.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.280
Really, a business appointment?

08:39.280 --> 08:40.240
A business appointment.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.000
Well, I guess, that's okay.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.080
Yeah, I mean, it was like the first time we were ever in the world cup and, you know,

08:46.080 --> 08:50.320
my boss didn't really put up much of a fight because I guess he also wanted to go watch the game.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.280
So, very similar to the events in this dialogue.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.280
Very similar, I guess, that's kind of the inspiration behind it.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.880
All right, guys, I hope you found some of these phrases helpful and useful.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.360
And remember, if you have any questions about anything you heard and today's lesson,

09:05.360 --> 09:08.240
please visit our website at EnglishPod.com.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.480
Yes, including me and Marco.

09:16.480 --> 09:16.800
Right.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.280
So, we'll see you there until then, it's...

09:19.280 --> 09:19.760
Bye!
