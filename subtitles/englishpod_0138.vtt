00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Hello everyone and welcome to English Pad, my name is Marco.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.200
Hi everyone, my name is Catherine.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.800
What do you got Catherine for us today?

00:08.800 --> 00:11.440
That's a good question. Well, we've got a little bit of a

00:11.440 --> 00:15.600
science field situation, so for those of you who are not familiar with this

00:15.600 --> 00:18.880
American TV show which by the way is one of my favorites.

00:18.880 --> 00:25.280
Science field is a TV show, a comedy about very awkward, very common

00:25.280 --> 00:28.800
situations that are taken to the extreme.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.000
Right, so it's a very popular show. It was around for like 10 years.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.040
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.880
But it's not airing anymore.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.880
Well, they're not making new episodes anymore.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.800
Now you have to see them in reruns.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.240
reruns, right? So we have a situation that's very common.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.480
It was pretty funny on the show.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.600
It's a guy trying to rent a car.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.360
Okay, so he's probably at the airport or traveling and he

00:51.360 --> 00:53.840
he's had a long flight and he wants to rent a car.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.520
But of course there are some problems.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.160
So this is an elementary level lesson by the way.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.280
So keep that in mind as we listen to this dialogue one time.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.680
Hi, I made a reservation for a midsize vehicle.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.520
The name is Jimmy Fox.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.720
I'm sorry.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.840
We have no midsize available at the moment.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.280
I don't understand.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.040
I made a reservation. Do you have my reservation?

01:21.040 --> 01:22.880
Yes, we do.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.520
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.040
But the reservation keeps the car here.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.200
That's why you have the reservation.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.160
I know why we have reservations.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.920
I don't think you do.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.000
If you did I'd have a car.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.560
See, you know how to take the reservation.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.120
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.840
And that's really the most important part of the reservation.

01:47.840 --> 01:48.560
The holding.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.800
Anybody can just take them.

01:50.800 --> 01:55.040
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.000
Fine.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I'll take the compact.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.040
All right.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.480
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr. Fox.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.520
Would you like insurance?

02:04.480 --> 02:08.560
Yeah, you better give me the insurance because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.560
All right, great.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.320
So this actually happens a lot.

02:16.400 --> 02:21.600
You make a reservation and either they lose it or they run out of cars.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.440
It's such a common situation.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.040
And it's not just cars.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.800
Sometimes this happens at restaurants too and it really makes me angry.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.760
Yeah, that happens a lot.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.240
You show up and they're like, oh, we don't have a reservation.

02:32.240 --> 02:35.680
And you're just like, well, then you have to keep yourself in check.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.640
You can't really get angry.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.520
But this guy does.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.760
So let's take a look at the language.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.680
Take a way to find out what are some of the words we're using here to describe

02:43.680 --> 02:46.240
renting a car and what kind of car we're talking about.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.840
Language takeaway.

02:49.840 --> 02:56.720
Well, as you mentioned, at rental places, they have different size cars, right?

02:56.720 --> 03:00.080
Different size vehicles, which by the way, costs different prices.

03:00.080 --> 03:00.960
Right.

03:00.960 --> 03:04.400
So let's take a look at the size that they mentioned in dialogue.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.800
And starting with the cheapest one, the least expensive and the smallest.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.400
It's a compact vehicle.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.840
All right, compact.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.280
So compact actually means small, small.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.680
Right, so compact car, you're going to hear a very often.

03:17.680 --> 03:23.040
Even if you're buying a car, let's think of what's a compact car.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.640
The VW Golf is a compact car, very small car.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.640
So usually it's two doors or if it's a four door car, it's very small.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.840
Not very long, right?

03:31.840 --> 03:32.640
Right, exactly.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.960
So maybe like a four focus could be a small car.

03:34.960 --> 03:35.920
Also compact.

03:35.920 --> 03:40.480
Now moving up in size a little bit, we would have a midsize vehicle.

03:40.480 --> 03:45.360
Okay, midsize vehicle is, well, it's a giveaway here because mid-mede's middle.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.080
So it's kind of in the middle between the small and the large.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.720
And this is your average four door sedan car.

03:50.720 --> 03:57.600
Okay, so as an example, you would have a four-taurus or maybe a Toyota Camry.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.640
Yeah, Toyota Camry is maybe the most common car.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.200
Mm-hmm.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.920
Yeah, that's kind of expensive, but it's still midsize, right?

04:03.920 --> 04:04.960
Exactly.

04:04.960 --> 04:10.160
And now a bigger car and probably one of the most popular cars in the United States

04:10.240 --> 04:11.440
is an SUV.

04:11.440 --> 04:12.640
Not any more Marco.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.120
I know.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.720
With the energy crisis and the gas prices.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.720
Uh, well, the economy as well.

04:18.720 --> 04:22.800
People are not driving their SUVs anymore, but SUV is an acronym.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.880
That means it stands for three different words.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.960
S meaning sports.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.560
You meaning utility.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.760
V vehicle.

04:29.760 --> 04:30.560
All right, thank you.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.560
So SUV sport utility vehicle means it can go maybe off road.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.200
Right.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.200
So an example of this would be a four-taurus or

04:39.280 --> 04:40.000
Jeep Cherokee.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.800
A Jeep Cherokee could be an SUV as well.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.880
So right, those are three different types of cars.

04:44.880 --> 04:51.600
Now obviously there are many more like a van or a limo, a limo, like a limousine.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.760
But yeah, these are the most common ones that you would rent at a car rental.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.960
Yes, definitely.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.720
But what we have to do here is make a reservation.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.920
Mm-hmm.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.960
Now interesting, you make a reservation.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.440
Yeah, you don't have it, you don't do it, you don't.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.200
You make it.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.240
Yeah, you make.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.240
These are words that go together.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.840
So we're going to keep them together.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.280
I can call a restaurant.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.960
So say, for example, Marco works at a restaurant.

05:16.960 --> 05:17.440
Say hello.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.840
I'd like to make a reservation for tonight.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.360
Oh, okay, perfect.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.680
Now if you show up at the restaurant, you say,

05:24.560 --> 05:25.440
where's my table?

05:25.440 --> 05:27.600
I made a reservation.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.400
Right.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.400
And of course, I throw a fit because there's no need for me.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.400
So you make a reservation and in this case, it was made before.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.080
Okay, so you make a reservation.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.040
Now, why was this guy angry at the rental car place?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.840
Oh, long story short.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.280
The company ran out of cars.

05:47.280 --> 05:47.840
Okay.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.560
Not all cars.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.520
Just the car that he wanted, the mid-size vehicle.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.360
So they ran out.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.600
So that doesn't mean they're actually running somewhere.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.560
No, they have put it on their running shoes and you're going for a jog.

05:58.560 --> 06:04.880
Now in this case, to run out or in this case, we ran out means that they don't have anymore.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.640
You don't have anymore, exactly.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.880
I think this word is a nice word for us to take a look at some other examples now.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.040
Example one.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.360
We're going to run out of gasoline.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.880
You need to find a gas station soon.

06:22.880 --> 06:23.680
Example two.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.320
Can you buy some milk on your way home?

06:28.320 --> 06:29.520
We ran out last night.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.760
Example three.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.960
My pen ran out to think.

06:36.960 --> 06:37.920
Can you lend me one please?

06:39.920 --> 06:45.600
Not a fun phrase, but an important one in case you're ever in a restaurant or in a hotel or in a place

06:45.600 --> 06:49.600
where you can purchase something or rent something and it's all gone.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.400
All right.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.680
So I think we've taken a look at a lot of great words here.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.920
So let's listen to this dialogue again.

06:55.920 --> 07:00.160
We're going to slow it down just a little bit and then we'll come back and explain some phrases.

07:00.240 --> 07:07.680
Hi, I made a reservation for a mid-sized vehicle.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.960
The name is Jimmy Fox.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.800
I'm sorry.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.360
We have no mid-sized available at the moment.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.280
I don't understand.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.640
I made a reservation.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.080
Do you have my reservation?

07:18.960 --> 07:20.960
Yes, we do.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.720
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.160
But the reservation keeps the car here.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.960
That's why you have the reservation.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.360
I know why we have reservations.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.280
I don't think you do.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.280
If you did I'd have a car.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.480
See, you know how to take the reservation.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.040
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.480
And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.840
Anybody can just take them.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.240
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.960
Fine, I'll take the compact.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.960
All right.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.400
We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr. Fox.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.600
Would you like insurance?

08:02.480 --> 08:06.480
Yeah, you better give me the insurance because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.360
And we're back.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.360
So Marco, we've got a couple phrases here that deserve some attention.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.920
So let's take a look at them in today's fluency builder.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.160
Fluency builder.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.680
So the first phrase that I want to take a look at is when the agent says,

08:25.680 --> 08:29.680
I'm sorry, we have no midsize available at the moment.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.280
Okay, so do they or do they not have any?

08:33.280 --> 08:36.320
Yes, he says that we have no midsize.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.680
Okay, so another way to say this is we haven't got any.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.160
Uh-huh.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.360
Oh, we don't have any.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.880
Okay, but in this case, you can just simplify it and say we have no.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.120
Why wouldn't you say we have none?

08:47.120 --> 08:48.000
Good question, why?

08:49.280 --> 08:50.560
Because we need a thing here.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.000
We have no cars.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.880
We have no cake.

08:52.880 --> 08:53.920
We have no food.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.520
So this is a very common phrase in English and remember to put the thing at the end.

08:59.520 --> 09:04.160
So, um, so for example, can I say, um, I have no money?

09:04.720 --> 09:05.440
Absolutely.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.200
I'm so sorry, Marco, but I'm not going to lend you.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.040
I have no money, seriously, lend me something.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.960
So we have no.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.800
This is interesting because this is not a structure that is usually

09:16.080 --> 09:17.840
learned through textbooks, right?

09:17.840 --> 09:23.280
Usually say I don't have or we haven't got exactly this very spoken because you would never say,

09:23.360 --> 09:24.480
I go no.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.840
Right, exactly.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.480
Right, we have to talk about something that we, uh,

09:28.480 --> 09:30.400
that has no object, something that we have.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.840
So here, I have no is very spoken, very common.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.560
It's got another phrase that is also not taught so much

09:38.560 --> 09:40.320
in those textbooks that we were just mentioning.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.720
So, uh, what's that phrase at the end?

09:42.720 --> 09:46.000
Well, well, it's a threat.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.600
The guy is so angry.

09:47.600 --> 09:52.720
He leans over the counter and he points his finger in the, uh, the agent's face.

09:52.880 --> 09:53.680
I don't want to say.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.800
He says, yeah, you better give me the insurance.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.760
You better.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.960
You better.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.440
All right, so you better than me?

10:01.440 --> 10:05.360
No, no, it's not like better, like something is good, right?

10:05.360 --> 10:10.080
You'd better is like a suggestion, but a very strong one, right?

10:10.080 --> 10:11.680
Very strong. This is a threat.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.640
Yeah, it's the best way.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.160
You better eat your dinner or I'm going to send you to your room.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.280
Exactly.

10:17.280 --> 10:17.440
Yeah.

10:17.440 --> 10:21.280
So, as you can see, it says, he says, you better.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.120
You better give me the insurance.

10:23.120 --> 10:27.520
But the grammatically correct way would be, you had better.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.400
You had better.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.880
So, the contraction would be you'd better.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.840
Exactly.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.480
You'd, you had better do this.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.080
So, this is a, it's a hypothetical situation.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.120
You had better do this.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.360
If you don't do this, bad things will happen.

10:41.360 --> 10:45.200
So, remember that here, we've got the grammatically correct form that you should write.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.600
You'd better or the spoken form.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.480
You better.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.600
You better.

10:49.760 --> 10:55.200
I think in this one, we should also listen to some other examples to get a better idea of how

10:55.200 --> 10:57.440
we can use this very strong suggestion.

10:58.480 --> 10:59.440
Example one.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.720
You better go to the doctor before that cold gets any worse.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.120
Example two.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.400
You better watch out.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.840
It's dangerous to go out this late.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.400
Example three.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.680
She better change her attitude or her boss is going to fire her.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.000
So, what is the threat?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.520
You better give me insurance because what is he going to do?

11:31.520 --> 11:35.280
He says, I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

11:35.280 --> 11:38.800
Okay, so this future, I'm going to, I'm gonna go on, huh?

11:38.800 --> 11:39.440
Right?

11:39.440 --> 11:41.280
Beat the hell out of this car.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.240
So, this is very strong, right?

11:44.240 --> 11:48.080
Yeah, it's very strong and he's saying he is going to destroy the car.

11:48.080 --> 11:52.080
So, beat the hell out of, so that means really just do damage just to something.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.920
So, you can use it at a towards a person.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.720
Also, it's like, I'm going to beat the hell out of you.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.760
And I'll arrest you.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.040
Right? So, it's a very strong phrase.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.720
It shows anger, it shows that you are threatening somebody.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.440
So, it's not, obviously, it's not polite.

12:08.240 --> 12:13.360
And it might get you a broken nose and a bar if you ever say this to someone or about someone.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.400
So, be very careful.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.880
Right? But you can use it to describe a situation, right?

12:16.880 --> 12:22.160
He's like, yeah, we went to a bar yesterday and Dan beat the hell out of the bartender.

12:23.440 --> 12:23.920
Right?

12:23.920 --> 12:24.720
Man.

12:24.720 --> 12:30.000
So, instead of just saying, Dan hit the bartender or Dan got into a fight,

12:30.400 --> 12:33.440
he or saying he hit him and he just...

12:33.440 --> 12:36.240
And he kept hitting him and he kept hitting him and he kept hitting him and he kept hitting him.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.320
So, yeah, he beat the hell out of him.

12:38.320 --> 12:38.720
Right.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.880
All right, great. So, those are the phrases and words that we wanted to talk about today.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.560
But I think it'd be good if we listened to this dialogue one more time just to get a good

12:46.640 --> 12:50.240
feel for it. When we come back, we talk a little bit more about the process of renting a car.

12:55.680 --> 12:59.680
Hi, I made a reservation for a mid-sized vehicle.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.720
The name is Jimmy Fox. I'm sorry.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.760
We have no mid-sized available at the moment.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.280
I don't understand.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.080
I made a reservation. Do you have my reservation?

13:10.960 --> 13:12.880
Yes, we do.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.720
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.160
But the reservation keeps the car here.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.560
That's why you have the reservation.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.360
I know why we have reservations.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.360
I don't think you do.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.280
If you did, I'd have a car.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.400
See, you know how to take the reservation.

13:32.400 --> 13:36.800
You just don't know how to hold the reservation and that's really the most important part of the

13:36.880 --> 13:38.560
reservation, the holding.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.840
Anybody can just take them.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.160
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
Fine. I'll take the compact.

13:47.920 --> 13:52.400
All right. We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr. Fox.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.600
Would you like insurance?

13:54.400 --> 13:58.480
Yeah, you better give me the insurance because I'm going to beat the hell out of this car.

13:58.800 --> 14:09.520
You know, I heard that in Florida, or in certain like cities of California and Florida,

14:09.520 --> 14:12.400
you can actually rent luxury cars.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.080
Oh, yeah, you can do that in most places.

14:14.080 --> 14:18.720
You can rent like a Porsche or a Lamborghini or a Ferrari.

14:18.720 --> 14:23.920
Yeah, obviously it costs a lot of money, but it gives you the opportunity to maybe drive

14:23.920 --> 14:27.840
to maybe drive one of these cars that you obviously wouldn't have the money to buy.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.920
Yeah, especially if you're talking about those warm places like Florida, California,

14:31.920 --> 14:34.800
you want to be in the sunshine, you get a convertible.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.240
Yeah, you gotta get a convertible.

14:36.240 --> 14:40.800
Yeah, so I think the insurance premiums on those particular cars are very high though.

14:40.800 --> 14:45.760
So you're not only paying for the car, but you're also paying for the insurance and possibly

14:45.760 --> 14:46.800
the speeding tickets.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.800
Yeah, of course. I can't imagine renting one of those cars and not getting a speeding ticket.

14:50.800 --> 14:56.160
Exactly. So if any of you out there have experienced renting cars or you have some questions

14:56.240 --> 15:02.160
about the specifics that are involved in this process, let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

15:02.160 --> 15:06.240
Right, we're there to answer any questions or doubts, and we'll see you guys there.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.240
All right, until next time, everyone. Bye.
