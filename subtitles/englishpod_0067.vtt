Hello English learners welcome back to English pod my name is Marco and I'm

00:05.760 --> 00:10.160
Erica and today we're bringing you another great lesson about sports part of our

00:10.160 --> 00:16.240
sports series that's right and in this lesson we are talking about maybe the world's

00:16.240 --> 00:22.080
most favorite sports right one of the most popular sports in the world soccer

00:22.080 --> 00:27.680
or also known as football in other countries yes okay so before we get started with

00:27.680 --> 00:32.240
this great lesson let's take a look at some of the words we'll find in the dialogue

00:32.240 --> 00:39.440
in vocabulary preview very vocabulary preview we're going to look at three words here the

00:39.440 --> 00:47.680
first word is wingman wingman a wingman now wingman isn't really related to soccer

00:47.680 --> 00:54.880
in any way okay but it's a way of referring to somebody as your right hand so your helper

00:54.960 --> 01:02.240
your helper your your number one guy okay right so a wingman is someone who helps you a lot

01:03.280 --> 01:12.160
exactly okay our next word tied tied they are tied they are tied now this is an

01:12.160 --> 01:19.680
interesting word because tie can be a noun verb and an adjective right exactly so in this case

01:19.760 --> 01:27.840
they are tied it's an adjective meaning they have the same score okay and a tie is a game

01:27.840 --> 01:34.320
that has ended with no winner or loser both of them have the same score exactly and so obviously

01:34.320 --> 01:41.600
the verb two tie is to reach the same score as your other team exactly all right well our third

01:41.680 --> 01:51.680
word can also be used as a noun and a verb and it is foul fouled fouled okay so two foul

01:51.680 --> 02:00.160
somebody is to do something to them that is not allowed in the sport okay and so when you do this

02:00.160 --> 02:06.960
you have committed a foul exactly okay so use it in the same way to foul or a foul

02:07.440 --> 02:13.520
interesting well we're going to hear these three words in context now so why don't we listen

02:13.520 --> 02:15.360
to our soccer dialogue

02:29.520 --> 02:33.520
welcome back soccer fans my name is Rick Fields and as always I am joined by my

02:33.520 --> 02:39.200
commentating weekman Bob Copeland and we are in the break of soccer history today as Ecuador and

02:39.200 --> 02:47.360
Brazil are tied one one as we begin the second half of the 2022 world cup the ref calls the players

02:47.360 --> 02:52.640
for the kickoff and here we go Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield but oh it's out of

02:52.640 --> 02:57.680
bow that will be a throw in for Brazil I do kind of know how to the ball and makes a long past of a

02:57.680 --> 03:03.600
wieniel and the ref is called the mob side no question about it he was off side by a mile we have

03:03.600 --> 03:09.040
a goal kick record or medicine menders heads of turbulence he shoots deflected by the defender

03:09.040 --> 03:15.920
and we have a corner kick then Gallo takes the corner we have a foul oh no D to the goalkeeper has

03:15.920 --> 03:21.360
foul the Ecuador in player he gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick this is the

03:21.360 --> 03:26.000
perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become world champions he gets ready

03:26.000 --> 03:36.000
for the kick he shoots and he

03:39.520 --> 03:47.600
okay so Ecuador tied with Brazil in the 2022 world cup wow Marko I'm really happy to see that you are

03:47.600 --> 03:55.200
able to see so far into the future well I called it so in 2022 if we do win the world cup

03:55.200 --> 04:01.680
you know who said it first all right you have money on that oh yes all right so apart from this we

04:01.680 --> 04:07.040
saw some really great vocabulary in this lesson so let's take a look at it now in language take away

04:09.360 --> 04:16.320
language take away all right you've got a lot of soccer words for you but they're all important

04:16.320 --> 04:24.960
so let's take a look at the first one kickoff kickoff kickoff so a kickoff this is how you start

04:24.960 --> 04:30.000
a soccer game right so it's the very beginning the referee blows the whistle and you kick the

04:30.000 --> 04:37.760
ball to another player that's the kickoff okay so our next phrase out of bounds out of bounds

04:37.760 --> 04:44.800
out of bounds okay out of bounds this is a great word hmm so in soccer when the ball goes out of

04:44.800 --> 04:50.720
bounds it goes outside the white lines right outside of the playing field okay and you can use it

04:50.720 --> 04:56.400
on all other sports you can use it in basketball you can use it in tennis or football or anything

04:56.400 --> 05:03.920
right so any part that is not for playing out of bounds what's our next word throw in

05:04.640 --> 05:11.600
a throw in a throw in okay so a throw in the ball goes out of bounds

05:11.600 --> 05:18.000
huh how do you put it back into play obviously a throw in okay so you throw in the ball that's the

05:18.000 --> 05:22.720
only time where a soccer player will actually grab the ball with his hands all right now another

05:22.720 --> 05:30.000
soccer term we have here off side off side off sides okay so this is a little bit difficult to

05:30.000 --> 05:36.800
explain but just imagine you're on the soccer field and you are trying to score a goal now you

05:36.800 --> 05:43.120
have some defenders right so the people who are trying to take the ball away and you pass the ball

05:43.120 --> 05:51.040
to somebody who is behind the defenders oh and that person is off side exactly so you must be

05:51.040 --> 05:56.240
at all times in the same position as the defenders or in front of them but you can't be all the way

05:56.240 --> 06:03.280
in the back okay so is this a noun or a verb or an adjective so this is an adjective he is off side

06:03.280 --> 06:09.680
that's his condition okay great excellent explanation mark with thank you right now we're going to look

06:09.680 --> 06:17.840
at three different phrases for three types of kicks in soccer okay so let's take a look at this

06:18.480 --> 06:25.360
the first one is goal kick a goal kick okay goal kick so who does the goal kick it's usually the

06:25.360 --> 06:31.440
goalie or the goalkeeper all right who takes the goal kick okay so when the goalie kicks the ball

06:32.160 --> 06:41.040
now what about a corner kick okay so if the team is attacking and the ball goes out of bounds

06:41.040 --> 06:47.120
in the back area near the goal then they get a corner kick they got to kick the ball from the corner

06:47.120 --> 06:54.080
of the field this is a great chance to score a goal isn't it exactly yes okay and our final kick a

06:54.080 --> 07:01.280
penalty kick penalty kick penalty kick so if a player gets fouled while he is in the area near

07:01.360 --> 07:08.480
the goal okay he gets a penalty kick so basically it's just him I think it's 13 or 15 steps away from the

07:08.480 --> 07:14.400
goalie and he gets the opportunity to score or to kick the ball so there are no defenders or other

07:14.400 --> 07:20.080
players in the way nobody wow another great chance to score a goal right all right well these are all

07:20.080 --> 07:27.280
great soccer words I think we should hear them again in context so let's listen this time a little bit slower

07:27.760 --> 07:40.400
welcome back soccer fans my name is Rick Fields and as always I am joined by my

07:40.400 --> 07:47.440
commentating wingman Bob Copeland and we're on the brink of soccer history today

07:48.080 --> 07:58.960
as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one one as we begin the second half of the 2022 world cup

07:59.760 --> 08:07.920
the ref calls the players for the kickoff and here we go Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield

08:07.920 --> 08:16.080
but oh it's out of bounds that will be a throw in for Brazil at the ground who has the ball and

08:16.080 --> 08:23.680
makes a long pass to Rubinho and the ref has called him upside no question about it he was off

08:23.680 --> 08:31.120
side by a mile we have a goal kick for Ecuador Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia he shoots

08:31.680 --> 08:39.360
deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick the legato takes the corner and we have a foul

08:40.080 --> 08:48.000
oh no the die the goalkeeper has fouled the Ecuadorian player he gets a yellow card and that

08:48.000 --> 08:53.760
will be a penalty kick this is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match

08:53.760 --> 09:01.360
and become world champions he gets ready for the kick he shoots and he

09:01.440 --> 09:10.240
all right so we heard these words that we were talking about in context and now some really

09:10.240 --> 09:15.680
interesting phrases came up and this would be a good time to take a look at them in fluency builder

09:16.880 --> 09:22.880
fluency builder well Marco there are three great phrases in this dialogue that I want to look at

09:22.960 --> 09:33.120
the first one on the brink of we are on the brink of we're on the brink of soccer history okay

09:33.120 --> 09:38.880
so on the brink of what exactly does that mean well why don't we hear some examples to help us

09:38.880 --> 09:47.200
understand the meaning example one look we don't have any money we're on the brink of going bankrupt

09:47.760 --> 10:00.160
example two the two countries are on the brink of war example three we're on the brink of an

10:00.160 --> 10:08.240
important discovery all right so great examples on the brink of at a critical point exactly

10:08.240 --> 10:15.200
means you're almost there right okay yeah very good and what about this next phrase that I saw

10:15.200 --> 10:24.400
and it was really interesting no question about it no question about it no question about it all right so

10:25.120 --> 10:31.280
this is a statement that doesn't really make much sense but what am I saying when I say oh no question

10:31.280 --> 10:37.840
about it you're saying I agree there is no doubts you're right you're right okay well let's give

10:37.840 --> 10:43.840
some examples I could say there's no question about it equidor is a great soccer team

10:44.000 --> 10:50.960
there is no question about that all right so or you can say no question about it our company

10:50.960 --> 10:56.800
makes the best products on the market okay so really useful phrase that you can use in sports

10:56.800 --> 11:02.560
or anywhere else okay and now let's take a look at our last phrase for fluency builder and it's a

11:02.560 --> 11:10.720
really good one to exaggerate a little bit okay by a mile by a mile by a mile so he was off

11:10.800 --> 11:17.600
side by a mile right so the commentator is saying that he was very off side that it was really

11:17.600 --> 11:24.480
obvious right so you can use that also in different contexts maybe not in sports okay so maybe we

11:24.480 --> 11:32.800
can say our company is ahead of all the others by a mile right or if you tell somebody to

11:32.800 --> 11:39.760
guess your age and they say oh I think you are 42 oh you could say you're off by a mile right

11:39.840 --> 11:44.400
so you're really really wrong exactly yeah so it's a way of exaggerating a little bit

11:44.400 --> 11:49.920
yes and thing is really obvious right well it's three awesome phrases and I think it will help

11:49.920 --> 11:53.280
us to hear them one more time so let's listen to the dialogue

11:53.280 --> 12:13.120
we'll come back soccer fans my name is Rick Fields and as always I am joined by my

12:13.120 --> 12:18.560
commentating wingman Bob Copeland and we are in the break of soccer history today as Ecuador

12:18.560 --> 12:26.640
and Brazil are tied one one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup the ref calls the

12:26.640 --> 12:32.000
players for the kickoff and here we go Ecuador quickly passes the ball into the midfield but oh it's

12:32.000 --> 12:36.720
out of bow that will be a throw in for Brazil I do kind of know how's the ball and makes a long

12:36.720 --> 12:42.960
past of a wienio and the ref is called the mobside no question about it he was off side by a mile

12:42.960 --> 12:48.160
we have a little kick record or Edison Mendes heads of turbulence he shoots deflected by the

12:48.160 --> 12:54.720
defender and we have a corner kick then Gallo takes the corner we have a foul oh no beat at the

12:54.720 --> 13:00.240
goalkeeper has foued Ecuador in player he gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick

13:00.240 --> 13:04.240
this is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World

13:04.320 --> 13:10.320
Champions he gets ready for the kick he shoots and he

13:19.920 --> 13:26.080
okay well as you all may know soccer is a very popular sport especially in Latin America

13:26.080 --> 13:31.120
that's right and your favorite team Ecuador are they are they are they really this good in soccer

13:31.680 --> 13:40.000
win the 2022 Cup well maybe not well actually Ecuador has has improved with time but usually it's

13:40.000 --> 13:47.760
the strong teams like Argentina in Brazil who dominate the region right but yeah hopefully we'll

13:47.760 --> 13:55.200
make it next time okay well I have my money on Ecuador and for 2022 but yet not on Canada there's no

13:55.200 --> 14:00.880
hope for us well Canada is doing really well now they actually beat Mexico if I'm not mistaken

14:00.880 --> 14:05.840
oh actually that sort of yeah I kind of remember that now but there's I think there's no hope for us

14:05.840 --> 14:10.880
to be Brazil or Argentina one of these big countries we have the next World Cup coming up so it's

14:10.880 --> 14:16.800
really exciting and I don't know who's going to win all right well um listeners who do you think

14:16.800 --> 14:23.040
is going to win who is the best soccer team out there right they're really good soccer teams although

14:23.040 --> 14:27.360
some of our some countries aren't really known for their soccer like Russia you don't really

14:27.360 --> 14:32.400
hear too much soccer from Russia really or from China is for that I wonder how popular it is in these

14:32.400 --> 14:38.560
countries so let us know come to our website englishpod.com tell us how popular soccer is in your
