Hello English learners. Welcome back to English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:06.720 --> 00:11.440
And my name is Katherine and today Marco and I get to share with you the thrilling conclusion

00:11.440 --> 00:16.560
to the, well, very popular. I must say series. I'm sorry. I love you.

00:16.560 --> 00:22.400
That's right. Today is the finale, the final episode. Episode 10. This is where it all ends.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.440
So what do you think is going to happen? If I guess you're just going to get angry at me because I

00:27.440 --> 00:32.560
actually know how it ends, but let's just say I hope that it ends well for protagonists.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.120
There was a lot of controversy around it because, you know, I wanted to know if people wanted

00:37.120 --> 00:42.240
a happy ending, a sad ending, unexpected. I guess everyone wants a happy ending, right?

00:42.240 --> 00:47.120
Absolutely. So we're going to, well, keep our fingers crossed for Steven and Veronica.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.000
And check out this dialogue one time.

00:57.440 --> 01:09.120
Steven, good to see you, brother. How are you? How was your trip?

01:09.120 --> 01:14.560
It was fine. I've been better, but it's great to be home. I've missed you all. How's mom?

01:14.560 --> 01:18.160
She's great. All she ever does is talk about you, or little boy,

01:18.160 --> 01:21.280
that event of the United States. You're her pride and joy. You know that.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.280
Can't wait to see her. You? What's new with you?

01:26.160 --> 01:30.560
Well, Nisha and I are expecting. You'll have another nephew, our niece soon.

01:31.280 --> 01:37.920
That's great. Wow. Congrats. You two are great together, you know. You have such a beautiful family.

01:37.920 --> 01:42.960
I hope that one day I can have that. Of course, man. Come on. I mean, everything was said here

01:42.960 --> 01:48.000
for you to marry Shalini. You know, she is still planning after you. I don't think she'll ever get over

01:48.960 --> 01:53.600
talking about. I hardly knew her. How could she be in love with me? I couldn't go through with it,

01:53.600 --> 01:57.360
even though she is a great woman. No, I left my hard night at the States.

01:58.480 --> 02:05.920
I just hope Veronica is happy. Get over it. You're home now. Everyone here thinks so highly of you.

02:05.920 --> 02:11.520
They'll be girls trying themselves at you. You can marry anyone you want. I don't want to marry anyone.

02:11.520 --> 02:17.840
I want to marry her. Don't you understand? You are incorrigible.

02:18.000 --> 02:31.920
See you, man. My baby, how warm are you? I miss you so much.

02:31.920 --> 02:37.920
You, um, great to see you. You look so thin. Did endosamericans feed you? Come, come.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.640
Let's have some time. By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you.

02:43.600 --> 02:50.240
Hi, Steven. Veronica, how did you get here? How do you know where I live?

02:51.040 --> 02:57.520
I waited for you at the airport, but you never showed. I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about,

02:57.520 --> 03:03.600
but we can discuss that later. I realized that I was just scared. Scared of how much I love you

03:03.600 --> 03:09.840
and of the commitment that marriage requires. I'm here now. Now, there's something I want to ask you.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.760
Steven, will you marry me?

03:28.800 --> 03:32.800
I now declare you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.

03:32.880 --> 03:47.280
Oh, you got married. We got married. I got married. Wow, I should have called my mom.

03:48.400 --> 03:53.600
Not only did you get married, but you got married. Bali would start with Bali music and

03:53.600 --> 04:01.040
everything. Those weddings are like four days long. I hope you enjoyed the finale of this story.

04:01.120 --> 04:04.480
Absolutely. I was glad to see that it was a happy ending. I have to say that if it had been a

04:04.480 --> 04:09.680
sad ending, I would have been a little bit disappointed because, well, Veronica and I

04:10.560 --> 04:15.920
you get along. We get along. All right. So apart from this happy ending and this happy finale that we had,

04:16.640 --> 04:21.600
we did look at a lot of great words and phrases. So why don't we start now with language takeaway?

04:23.440 --> 04:29.520
Language takeaway. So the first couple of phrases I want to talk about here have to do with maybe

04:29.520 --> 04:36.880
catching up and talking about family or gossip because we're talking to family members.

04:36.880 --> 04:43.040
In the end family, we haven't seen for a long time. The first thing he's talking to his brother

04:43.040 --> 04:48.480
about his brother and his wife. So Gulam and Nisha are expecting we find out.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.640
Right, they're expecting. So I've Gulam and Nisha are expecting. What does that mean?

04:52.640 --> 04:56.800
Exactly. They're expecting a letter. Expecting a baby maybe?

04:56.880 --> 05:01.840
Ah, yeah. So here we go. I'm expecting is very common English way of saying,

05:01.840 --> 05:06.640
I'm going to have a baby. I'm pregnant. All right. So don't get this confused.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.160
If somebody says, oh, well, I'm expecting. You don't have to say expecting what?

05:10.160 --> 05:13.840
Exactly. When it's only expecting when it's not a thing afterwards,

05:13.840 --> 05:18.400
I'm expecting means I'm pregnant or she's expecting. She's going to have a baby.

05:19.200 --> 05:24.160
So they are expecting a baby or they're expecting. Well, and they were talking about, well,

05:24.240 --> 05:29.520
so Steven, he was supposed to get married in India and his brother said a very

05:29.520 --> 05:34.720
interesting where he said, well, these girls are still, this girl is still pining over you.

05:34.720 --> 05:40.560
So the Shalini, some girl that Steven used to know when he was living in India, she's pining

05:40.560 --> 05:47.440
after you. Well, pine has many different meanings. Right. But in this sense, we're talking about

05:47.440 --> 05:52.720
having a crush on or being in love with. And also it's a way of saying that you are that you

05:52.800 --> 05:58.240
desire you yearn for this person very, very much. But that you don't have them. Right. You want them.

05:58.240 --> 06:02.720
You want them. So you're pining over this person. Now can you pine over an object?

06:03.760 --> 06:08.960
No. No. Usually it's maybe related to love or to a person, right?

06:08.960 --> 06:15.600
Yeah. So she stands by the door every day, waiting the letter that doesn't come. She's pining away

06:15.600 --> 06:21.360
for her dear love, Thomas or whatever. And you know what I read recently is that people can get

06:21.760 --> 06:27.440
addicted to pining. Really? Yeah. After a breakup, maybe you can pine after a person not because

06:27.440 --> 06:32.080
you miss them or you want to put you kind of grow a custom to it and you become addicted to this

06:32.080 --> 06:37.840
pain that's kind of pleasurable. There is a way to describe this. It's called Petrarchin Love.

06:37.840 --> 06:43.520
Well, it's this kind of traditional idea in poetry where you have a love that's never

06:43.520 --> 06:49.200
consummated. It's never filled. You never get to be with the person that you love that you desire.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.680
And so it's a way, yeah. It's a way of distinguishing the two different kinds of love. One

06:53.680 --> 06:57.360
where you're with the person and the other where you always want them, but you can never have them.

06:58.400 --> 07:03.120
Well, but hopefully none of our listeners are pining over anyone or get to experience that,

07:03.120 --> 07:08.880
huh? Exactly. But if you do pine away or if you pine after someone,

07:10.560 --> 07:15.760
you have to hope that one day you'll get over that person. Yeah. You have to get over it. And that's what

07:15.840 --> 07:21.360
his brother says, hey, get over it. I don't think she'll ever get over you. So what does it mean

07:21.360 --> 07:25.840
when you're supposed to get over someone? Okay. This is a good question because, you know,

07:25.840 --> 07:31.040
we're talking here not about actually getting up on top of a fence or a wall. We're talking

07:31.040 --> 07:38.640
about emotions. So getting over someone, so I have to get over him means that I have to stop

07:38.640 --> 07:43.200
feeling so sad about what what happened, right? Because usually you say this when someone's

07:43.200 --> 07:48.960
sad or angry. And also it kind of means that you have to forget or let that person go, you know,

07:48.960 --> 07:52.960
like, get over it. We're going to move on here too. It's the last word in today's language

07:52.960 --> 08:00.000
takeaway, which is incorrigible. Okay. An incorrigible person. All right. In incorrigible. What could

08:00.000 --> 08:06.080
this mean? Well, let's look at the sentence where we find it. You are incorrigible. Mm-hmm.

08:06.080 --> 08:11.440
Gulam says this to Stephen. Right. So it's an adjective and basically means that you have no

08:11.440 --> 08:16.400
correction of some sort. Or there's an argument between Stephen and Gulam. So their brothers

08:16.400 --> 08:21.520
and Stephen says, I don't want to get married. I don't want to marry her. Uh, he's complaining in

08:21.520 --> 08:27.280
his brother says, you are incorrigible. You just won't stop. Right. So someone's, someone's feelings,

08:27.280 --> 08:32.400
their emotions, their ideas about something. They just can't be changed or altered. They're fixed.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.840
You know, this guy, he's like, I'm not going to get married and his brother says,

08:36.400 --> 08:40.560
you're incorrigible. I just can't change your mind. It's kind of like being stubborn. Yeah,

08:40.640 --> 08:47.440
exactly. And we hear this phrase a lot together. So you're incorrigible. Right. So this is often just

08:47.440 --> 08:53.200
kind of a, it's a, it's not an insult, but it's a way for us to kind of be sarcastic or to make fun of

08:53.200 --> 08:57.680
someone. Mm-hmm. You're incorrigible, Marco. Yeah. You usually say when you're like, you know,

08:57.680 --> 09:03.200
you're being nice. All right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Cool. So five great words in language take away today.

09:03.200 --> 09:08.320
And well, before we move on and listen to the dialogue, again, why don't we take a look at

09:08.400 --> 09:15.280
fluency builder? Fluency builder. All right. This first phrase is something that parents often use

09:15.280 --> 09:19.440
and grandparents as well, because obviously, parents and grandparents are very proud of their

09:19.440 --> 09:24.800
children and grandchildren. So they describe something as being their pride and joy.

09:24.800 --> 09:30.320
Mm-hmm. My pride and joy. So it's usually a person that's your pride and joy. It could be a thing, too.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.920
It could be a thing. His Porsche Boxster is his pride and joy. He goes out every morning and he washes it.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
He changes the oil. He checks the gas. He checks the tire. So it's his pride and joy. All right.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.880
It's his most valued possession. So it always goes together, right? My pride and joy.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.640
Pride and joy. Yeah. Just think of it as a phrase. Pride and joy. All right. So

09:51.920 --> 09:57.760
I'm my mother's pride and joy. I think you are. Mm-hmm. All right. So you know how my mom

09:59.280 --> 10:05.520
all right. So somebody's pride and joy. So now in another phrase that we took a look at and it's a

10:05.520 --> 10:09.520
way of making conversation especially with a person that you haven't seen in a while. He said,

10:09.520 --> 10:15.280
hey, what's new with you? What's new with you? Uh-huh. What's new with you? All right. So this

10:15.280 --> 10:20.080
might sound a little strange because normally we say, how have you been? It's been a long time. How are you?

10:20.080 --> 10:25.920
But this is like, you know, it's a fluency builder phrase. So it's very colloquial. It's very spoken language.

10:25.920 --> 10:30.720
So this you hear often between friends or family members. Hey, Marco, what's new with you?

10:30.720 --> 10:36.480
So how do you, I would answer this by saying, oh, well, not much or, uh, I just bought a new house.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.960
So basically you're asking for news. Yeah. I haven't seen you in a long time. You look,

10:40.960 --> 10:46.800
you look happy and healthy. So what's new with you? Oh, I got married. I got a new car. Mm-hmm.

10:46.800 --> 10:51.760
These things that you can say these are changes in my life. All right. And usually after somebody

10:51.760 --> 10:55.920
asks you, what's new with you? You say something and then you usually would follow up and ask that

10:55.920 --> 11:00.320
person as well, right? What's new? And what's new with you? Exactly. So, you know, I got an

11:00.320 --> 11:05.520
in house, got a new job. What's new with you? Yeah. Or what about you? What about you? So it's a nice,

11:05.520 --> 11:12.080
very relaxed, informal way of asking someone for news in their life. Perfect. All right. What's new with you?

11:13.120 --> 11:17.520
What else? Now he was supposed to get married, right? Right. So this is news. He was supposed to get

11:17.520 --> 11:21.760
married. He didn't get married. What's going on? His brother, his mother, they all want to know

11:21.760 --> 11:27.840
what's going on. And we find out that wedding, that girl, he just couldn't go through with it.

11:27.840 --> 11:32.160
Mm-hmm. So I can't, I couldn't go through with it. Okay. There's past tense. So he's saying,

11:32.160 --> 11:36.400
before I came to India with this girl, I couldn't go through with it. Mm-hmm. So present

11:36.400 --> 11:41.680
would be, I can't go through with it. Mm-hmm. And going through with what? Here. We've got it.

11:41.680 --> 11:46.960
So this kind of magical, strange word. It, what it, what could this be? So basically, what he's saying

11:46.960 --> 11:53.120
is that he couldn't complete or maybe finish something that he started, right? So in this case,

11:53.120 --> 12:00.480
we're talking about a relationship or marriage. So maybe we love each other, but I couldn't go through with it.

12:00.480 --> 12:05.440
I couldn't go to the finish line. Mm-hmm. Right. I couldn't get married. You see that a lot when

12:05.440 --> 12:10.480
maybe in movies, two people are supposed to get married. They're at the altar. And all of a sudden,

12:10.480 --> 12:17.120
the bride says, I can't, or she goes away crying. I can't go through with it. Exactly. Right.

12:17.120 --> 12:22.240
So because she loves somebody else, so can't go through with it. Mm-hmm. Great. So really good

12:22.240 --> 12:28.640
phrase. I can't go through with it. He couldn't go through with it. And we find out that, well,

12:28.640 --> 12:34.000
not such a bad thing. Steven, he's very popular in India. The girls love him. We've got a great phrase,

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
but it's describing having lots of girls who love you. Right. He says, there will be girls

12:40.000 --> 12:45.040
throwing themselves at you. Literally like, oh, that might happen. I can't imagine that. Like,

12:45.040 --> 12:51.200
just somebody throwing themselves at you? No. It's not literal. It's basically saying girls are very

12:51.200 --> 12:55.600
interested in you. Girls are so interested in you that they'll be chasing you almost. All right.

12:55.600 --> 13:01.520
So many, many girls, they will follow you. They'll want to be in a relationship with you. They like you.

13:01.520 --> 13:06.720
So he's saying, listen, there are other girls. Don't worry. Girls hear, they love you.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.680
And it doesn't only work with girls, right? I can say they'll be boys throwing themselves at you.

13:11.680 --> 13:17.440
Right. So this is something we say about both genders, boys and girls. You can say, oh, God,

13:17.440 --> 13:24.080
all the boys were throwing themselves at her. I'm so jealous. Right. So, but it's only basically

13:24.080 --> 13:28.320
in a loving way, right? It can't be anything else. Like, somebody's chasing you for other reasons.

13:29.360 --> 13:33.920
Now, this is saying that they have crushes. They have feelings. They want to be romantic. It's not

13:33.920 --> 13:38.800
like a, it's not a bad thing, but sometimes it's too much attention. So it can be kind of negative.

13:38.800 --> 13:43.920
Yeah. All right. Well, interesting phrases on Fluency Builder today. I think it's time for us to

13:43.920 --> 13:48.880
listen to this dialogue for one last time. Get up and dance. Yeah. Get up and dance and we'll be back in a

13:48.880 --> 13:50.880
little bit.

14:04.880 --> 14:10.480
Steven, good to see you, brother. How are you? How was your trip? It was fine. I've been better,

14:10.480 --> 14:16.160
but it's a great to be home. I've missed you all. How's mom? She's great. All she ever does is talk

14:16.160 --> 14:20.880
about you or little boy that have empty United States. You're her pride and joy. You know that.

14:21.920 --> 14:27.760
Can't wait to see you. You, what's new with you? Well, Nisha and I are expecting.

14:28.400 --> 14:35.120
You'll have another nephew, our niece soon. That's great. Wow. Congrats to a great together.

14:35.120 --> 14:41.120
You know, it's such a beautiful family. I hope that one day I can have that. Of course, man. Come on.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.600
I mean, everything was set here for you to marry Shalini. You know, she is still planning

14:45.600 --> 14:50.640
after you. I don't think she'll ever get over you. What are you talking about? I hardly knew her.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.800
How could she be in love with me? I can go through with it even though she is a great woman.

14:54.800 --> 15:03.040
No, I left my heart in the United States. I just hope Veronica is happy. Get over it. You're home now.

15:03.040 --> 15:09.040
Everyone here thinks so highly of you. They'll be girls trying themselves at you. You can marry anyone you want.

15:09.040 --> 15:15.600
I don't want to marry anyone. I want to marry her. Don't you understand? You are incorrigible.

15:24.800 --> 15:33.280
See you then. My baby, how warm are you? I miss you so much. You are great to see you.

15:33.280 --> 15:38.880
You look so thin. They didn't do some American speed you. Come, come. Let's have some time.

15:38.880 --> 15:47.920
By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you. Hi, Steven. Veronica, how did you get here?

15:48.800 --> 15:53.040
How do you know where I live? I waited for you at the airport, but you never showed.

15:53.600 --> 15:59.040
I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.440
I realized that I was just scared, scared of how much I love you and

16:04.240 --> 16:10.720
of the commitment that marriage requires. I'm here now. Now, there's something I want to ask you. Steven,

16:11.440 --> 16:14.720
will you marry me?

16:23.680 --> 16:32.400
I now declare you husband and wife. You may kiss to her.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.520
All right, so it's over.

16:42.640 --> 16:49.440
Sad, sad but sweet. Sad but sweet. We went from them meeting casually by a bike accident.

16:50.400 --> 16:56.560
Yeah, we had nice music. Then it turned out that she was angry. They kind of broke up.

16:56.560 --> 17:01.840
They got back together. He was being strained with all of these secret trips to save people.

17:03.280 --> 17:07.600
It's uh, it was interesting. We went a lot of different ways people. She was pregnant. She wasn't

17:07.600 --> 17:14.720
really pregnant. The doctor was stalking the doctor. He's in the secret service. It was an

17:14.880 --> 17:21.920
interesting ride. Very interesting. Well, now we need to think of a new drama, a new soap opera

17:21.920 --> 17:27.040
or novel. So we need your input. Maybe we should open it up. What did you like? What didn't

17:27.040 --> 17:32.320
you like? And what kind of genre are you interested in? Because you know there's tons of different

17:32.320 --> 17:38.160
kinds of stories we could tell. Right, maybe we can do something scary, like a thriller or horror.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.840
I'm a big fan of sci-fi. Or sci-fi, maybe we can do something sci-fi.

17:42.800 --> 17:47.040
Maybe we can do a comedy, something maybe like friends. I don't know. That'd be kind of cute.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.800
Yeah, it could be. All right. So listeners, why don't you give us your input? We need your

17:50.800 --> 17:56.080
feedback tell us. What series you would like next? What type of series? Maybe like we said drama,

17:56.080 --> 18:00.960
