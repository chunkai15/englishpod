00:00.000 --> 00:08.700
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we're at a wedding ceremony

00:08.700 --> 00:17.240
All right, nice. Another nice wedding. Yeah, but of course it wouldn't be EnglishPod unless we have something unexpected happening at this wedding

00:17.240 --> 00:28.160
Okay, so we're gonna be talking about hands. Oh, but Markle, what is there to say about a hand? Well as you may or may not know each finger has a name on your hand

00:28.160 --> 00:33.460
Okay, so we're gonna learn how we're so we're gonna learn what those names are in English perfect and

00:34.160 --> 00:38.960
Also, we're gonna learn about some common phrases that you might hear in an English wedding

00:39.360 --> 00:41.360
exactly because I think

00:41.760 --> 00:51.500
Exactly because usually it's old English. Maybe English that's not used anymore. All right. Well, I'm excited to find out what this unexpected event is

00:51.760 --> 00:54.480
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time

00:58.160 --> 01:14.160
The ring, please. May this ring be blessed. So he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace

01:14.160 --> 01:25.440
and continue in love until lives end. With this ring, I be wet. Where it is a symbol of our love and commitment

01:28.640 --> 01:42.160
Honey, that's my pinky. The ring goes on the ring finger. Is one? That's my index finger. No right. This one right?

01:44.160 --> 01:53.360
That's the thumb, Nick. Okay, I got it. This is the ring finger. That's my middle finger neck. This is my ring finger

01:58.400 --> 02:16.000
All right, embarrassing moments for the groom. Yes. Confusing the fingers in front of all his friends and family. Not good. So I mentioned before that

02:16.000 --> 02:22.080
We're gonna learn the names of each finger in your hand. So let's get started. Let's take a look at these in language takeaway

02:22.640 --> 02:24.640
Language takeaway

02:26.640 --> 02:32.640
All right, well, why don't we start with the smallest finger on your hand the smallest finger on your hand

02:33.200 --> 02:42.320
That's called the pinky pinky pinky. Sometimes people call it the little finger. Yes, right? Yep. So the pinky and the next finger

02:43.040 --> 02:51.440
Is the one the groom couldn't find okay the ring finger the ring finger. So this is of course like the name says

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
Where the wedding ring is usually placed exactly. Yep. Now the next one is a controversial finger

02:58.400 --> 03:07.840
That must be the middle finger. Okay easy middle finger. So why is it controversial? Well, you know, if you put your middle finger up

03:08.960 --> 03:15.200
And you like you're doing right now, honey. Sorry, Mark, go do it this way and all other fingers down

03:15.760 --> 03:22.960
You are making a very rude gesture. It's a rude sign. So what would you call that? I would call that

03:23.760 --> 03:32.640
Giving the middle finger giving the middle finger or I've also heard the phrase flip someone off. Yes or also flip the bird flip the bird

03:32.960 --> 03:40.640
Exactly or give him the bird. Yes, so all phrases that you can use when you are showing only your middle finger

03:41.200 --> 03:45.200
It's not very polite. No, don't do it. Don't do it unless somebody deserves it. I guess

03:46.880 --> 03:53.840
We won't talk about that, but what we will talk about is the next finger the index finger the index finger

03:54.240 --> 04:01.680
index finger. So this is the finger you use to point right yep the index finger any idea why they call it the index finger

04:01.920 --> 04:09.280
Because when you're looking through the index of a book you always use this finger right I I think you also use this finger to pass

04:09.600 --> 04:13.120
Pages on a book, right? Yeah, okay, don't believe anything. I just don't know

04:14.080 --> 04:20.720
Well, we're not sure maybe you guys know the real answer to this all right and our last finger the most important one the thumb

04:22.000 --> 04:24.240
THU and B the thumb

04:25.520 --> 04:32.400
Okay, so that's the short but fat finger the the very movable one the move and don't that you use to play

04:32.800 --> 04:38.880
PlayStation video games. Yeah, okay, so the pronunciation here. Do you say the B at the end of this word?

04:39.280 --> 04:45.120
No, I will actually only pronounce the M the thumb the thumb yeah, you wouldn't say the thumb no

04:46.320 --> 04:51.920
Okay, so now that we're clear on all five fingers. Let's listen to our dialogue again

04:51.920 --> 04:56.240
And then we'll come back and talk about these difficult phrases that the priest used

05:00.240 --> 05:02.240
The rings please

05:02.320 --> 05:11.200
May this ring be blessed, so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace and continue in love

05:11.760 --> 05:13.760
until life's end

05:13.760 --> 05:16.080
With this ring I be wet

05:17.360 --> 05:22.320
Where it is a symbol of our love and commitment honey?

05:23.280 --> 05:26.720
That's my pinky the ring goes on the ring finger

05:27.680 --> 05:34.000
That's one that's my index finger. No, right this one right

05:35.760 --> 05:44.080
That's the thumb neck. Okay, I got it. This is the ring finger. That's my middle finger neck. This is my ring finger

05:48.480 --> 05:51.600
Well, this is really common wedding

05:51.840 --> 05:58.480
Speak is in it. Yeah, it's really common. That's what usually the priest or the person who is marrying somebody would say

05:58.800 --> 06:04.240
Well, why don't we look at some of these phrases now because it's really interesting to talk about their meaning

06:04.880 --> 06:08.240
So the first one may this ring be blessed

06:09.040 --> 06:15.760
May this ring be blessed. May this ring be blessed. So what does it mean when you bless something or someone?

06:16.080 --> 06:24.000
Well, usually the the religious leader does this right and he's giving good wishes to that thing

06:24.240 --> 06:30.640
Could be for an object or to a person, right? Yes, you can be blessed. Yeah, and so these good wishes usually come from God

06:31.120 --> 06:39.280
Okay, great. So what about our next phrase abide in peace abide in peace?

06:40.240 --> 06:49.600
Wow, so this verb abide it means to live to live to be to be in peace. Yeah, but it's very fancy

06:49.600 --> 06:57.440
I don't know if you use it anymore. No, I think you would you would never use this word in conversation or even very rarely in writing

06:57.440 --> 07:02.000
It's quite old. Yes, definitely. I would agree. So abide in peace

07:02.800 --> 07:08.880
Okay, what about our next phrase? I like this and it's the common phrase you'll hear in all movies and in all marriages

07:09.440 --> 07:20.880
With this ring. I the wed with this ring. I the wed with this ring. I the wed. Okay, we've got two words in here that are also older English words. So

07:21.680 --> 07:22.880
the the

07:22.880 --> 07:23.840
T-h

07:23.840 --> 07:24.800
E-e

07:24.800 --> 07:26.480
T-e

07:26.480 --> 07:27.520
V

07:27.520 --> 07:37.760
So this is an this is a middle English term for you you. Yes, so I would can I say I love the you could that would be very romantic

07:38.400 --> 07:44.320
Also inappropriate for the office, but it's very olding. I guess you would if you're reading Shakespeare

07:44.320 --> 07:49.920
You would definitely come upon this, right? Yes, and what about wed? This is also an old

07:50.640 --> 07:58.480
word for an old verb for the action of marrying someone. So I can say we will be wed next year

07:59.120 --> 08:01.920
But don't say that now because you'll sound quite silly

08:02.560 --> 08:08.480
Yeah, it's too old-fashioned. Yeah, I guess so, but it's good to know if especially if you guys are reading something

08:08.720 --> 08:11.520
A little bit more classical or you plan to get married to an English person

08:12.800 --> 08:14.800
All right, and our last phrase

08:15.280 --> 08:23.120
Where it as a symbol of our love and commitment where it as a symbol of our love and commitment? So now he's referring to the rings, right?

08:23.120 --> 08:31.840
Where the ring has a symbol a sign a representation. Yes, of love and commitment. So why would you wear a ring as a

08:32.000 --> 08:37.760
Symbol of something? Well, obviously, you know love you can't see it you can't touch it, right?

08:37.760 --> 08:43.440
So you need something to show you that it's there. So you need a sign of that love. Something that you can see.

08:43.440 --> 08:49.520
So that's what the ring represents. Yeah, but how about this word commitment? The commitment is a strong promise.

08:49.520 --> 08:57.360
So you promise to love that person to take care of them. Yes, and yeah, okay great. So now we are a little bit more familiar

08:57.440 --> 09:04.000
with some of the language you hear in a wedding ceremony, and we also know all of the names of the fingers. Exactly.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.320
So why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to hear these all in context?

09:10.400 --> 09:28.480
The ring, please. Made this ring be blessed. So he who gives it, and she who wears it,

09:28.480 --> 09:37.040
may abide in peace, and continue in love until lives end. With this ring, I be wet.

09:37.680 --> 09:50.640
Where it is a symbol of our love and commitment? Honey, that's my pinky. The ring goes on the ring finger.

09:51.920 --> 10:01.040
So what? That's my index finger. No right, this one right. Let's the thumb make.

10:01.920 --> 10:08.960
Okay, I got it. This is the ring finger. That's my middle finger neck. This is my ring finger.

10:19.280 --> 10:25.920
All right, so now it's perfectly clear and a romantic dialogue in the end. Yeah, very romantic.

10:26.560 --> 10:31.360
Although a little bit embarrassing. Yeah. So what about wedding rings? Now we have different types

10:31.360 --> 10:36.160
of rings, right? We have the wedding ring, the one that that we just heard. Yeah, but we also have an

10:36.160 --> 10:41.200
engagement ring. Yes, yeah. In most English speaking countries, the woman is very, very lucky

10:41.760 --> 10:49.840
because she gets too ring. Right. So when the man asks her to marry him, he gives her a diamond.

10:49.840 --> 10:54.240
A diamond ring that is usually that's the engagement ring. And it's it's really, really

10:54.400 --> 10:59.440
important that he does this. And it's also really important that he spends a lot of money on the

10:59.440 --> 11:04.960
end of the diamond. Yeah, I know about this. Diamonds are forever. Yes. And the tradition is you must

11:04.960 --> 11:12.160
spend at least one month salary. Wow. Yes, I said it. Yeah. So the girl gets an diamond engagement ring.

11:12.160 --> 11:17.680
And then on wedding day, she gets the wedding ring. Yes. And usually, will she wear both of them?

11:17.680 --> 11:22.800
Yeah, she'll always wear both of them. So the engagement ring goes closest to you and then the wedding ring

11:22.880 --> 11:30.880
on top. And the engagement ring, it represents the commitment to marry her. So the commitment

11:30.880 --> 11:35.440
from the man to marry her. Okay, so that it's a symbol that they will get married. Yes, it's a symbol

11:35.440 --> 11:41.840
of the promise. Now what happens if they break up and they don't get married? Does he get the ring back?

11:41.840 --> 11:52.480
I don't know. Okay, here's the rule. If he was a jerk, no. But if it was sort of like a happy

11:52.480 --> 11:59.280
breakup, then okay. Okay. I guess it's a big risk, right? All right. So that's all for today. Guys,

11:59.280 --> 12:03.840
let us know if you guys have any interesting wedding stories. I know that sometimes weddings can be

12:03.840 --> 12:10.800
embarrassing. People, I don't know, objecting. Maybe I've seen the groom faint. Or even fall in a pool.

12:10.800 --> 12:16.240
