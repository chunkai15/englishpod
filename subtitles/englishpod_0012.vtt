00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco. I'm Erica and today we have

00:07.040 --> 00:12.320
a great intermediate lesson for you. That's right. We've got some excellent real English for you

00:12.320 --> 00:16.880
all about cleaning the house. Cleaning the house. That's a real life situation so we're going to

00:16.880 --> 00:22.240
give you real English. Exactly. So in today's lesson we're going to look at language about cleaning

00:22.240 --> 00:27.520
the house. We're also going to learn a few phrases that you can use if you want to ask someone

00:27.520 --> 00:34.400
for help and maybe if you're a little bit lazy like me a phrase or two to avoid doing work.

00:34.400 --> 00:38.160
Okay well let's get started then with our vocabulary preview.

00:39.280 --> 00:44.800
vocabulary preview. All right great. We have two great words for you today. Erica why don't you tell

00:44.800 --> 00:53.120
us the first one? The first word is such a mess. Such a mess. Such a mess. So when something is a

00:53.120 --> 00:59.760
mess it's dirty. Yeah or things are everywhere. It's organized. Yeah so you know you have your

00:59.760 --> 01:06.640
clothes on the floor and your shoes. Okay so that sounds a lot like my desk out there. Your shoes

01:06.640 --> 01:11.680
on your desk. Yeah I've seen that. I've been wanting to ask you about that. Okay such a mess

01:11.680 --> 01:19.680
really really dirty. Okay now let's take a look at our second word chores. Chores. Chores. Chores.

01:19.680 --> 01:26.320
Chores is a really common word for things you have to do around the house. Like for example laundry

01:27.120 --> 01:32.720
or making the bed or when you have to take out the garbage. Those are all examples of chores.

01:32.720 --> 01:37.520
Chores yeah. I guess everyone can remember when they were kids they had chores to do. Yeah when I

01:37.520 --> 01:44.400
was a kid it was my chore to chop wood. Chop wood. Yeah that's a great chore in playing with an

01:44.400 --> 01:49.600
axe. Maybe you're a boy but for a girl it was not so great. Ah that's why you're so strong

01:49.600 --> 01:55.760
in fit. All right so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time. It's gonna be kind of fast

01:55.760 --> 02:02.000
but don't worry if you miss something because it will explain all of the important language afterwards.

02:02.480 --> 02:14.560
Honey the house is such a mess. I need you to help me tidy up a bit. My boss and her husband

02:14.560 --> 02:19.600
are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless. I'm in the middle of something

02:19.600 --> 02:26.160
right now. I'll be there in a second. This can't wait I need your help now. All right

02:26.640 --> 02:32.400
I'm coming. Okay here's a list of chores we need to get done. I'll do the dishes and get

02:32.400 --> 02:37.040
all the groceries for tonight. You can sweep them up the floors. Oh and the furniture needs to be

02:37.040 --> 02:43.360
dusted. You know what I have to pick something up in the mall so why don't you clean the floors

02:43.360 --> 02:48.240
and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries. Sure that's fine. Here's the list of all

02:48.240 --> 02:53.920
the things you need to get. Don't forget anything and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

02:56.560 --> 03:05.600
Hey honey I'm back. Wow the house looks really good. Great can you set the table?

03:07.280 --> 03:12.320
Just a sec. I'm just going to vacuum this rug well fast. Wait don't turn it on

03:12.320 --> 03:31.520
So my god marker what happened there? An explosion. We love a good explosion here at English

03:31.520 --> 03:37.520
class. We're going to give you as many explosions as possible. Okay so let's take a look at our

03:37.520 --> 03:48.160
language takeaway. Language takeaway. So language takeaway is the part of our lesson where we teach you

03:48.160 --> 03:54.480
what we think are some really important words that are found in the dialogue. Exactly and we have

03:54.480 --> 03:59.600
three really important words in our dialogue today so let's start with the first one.

03:59.600 --> 04:11.280
Tidy up. Tidy up. So to tidy up means to put things in their correct spot. Right so put the shoes

04:11.280 --> 04:17.760
on the floor. Take those shoes off my desk. Exactly so tidy up. Organize things a little bit. Yeah put

04:17.760 --> 04:26.480
things away. Okay let's take a look at our second word now. Spotless. Spotless. Spotless. Spotless.

04:26.480 --> 04:32.880
So when you want something to be spotless you want it to be really clean really clean not a spot

04:32.880 --> 04:38.960
of dirt on it. Like your desk. Exactly my desk is spotless. My desk is not spotless.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.840
All right great word. Now let's take a look at our last word for language takeaway. Mall.

04:46.560 --> 04:53.920
Mall. Mall. M-A-L-L. Mall. Yeah it's a strange sounding word.

04:53.920 --> 05:01.280
It is a little bit funny sounding but it basically means a large building with many shops inside.

05:01.280 --> 05:06.240
Many different stores inside. Right now in British English you would say shopping centers.

05:06.240 --> 05:12.400
I think that's a little bit more common but in American English we say mall. Great so now it's time

05:12.400 --> 05:23.920
in our show to look at putting it together. Putting it together. Okay so in putting it together

05:23.920 --> 05:31.040
we take a word from the dialogue and we show you how to use this word in real English. So we give

05:31.040 --> 05:38.080
you a couple of examples of how this particular word can be used. Exactly so the word that we have

05:38.080 --> 05:45.600
for today is groceries. Groceries. Groceries. Groceries. Erica why don't you tell us what groceries are

05:45.600 --> 05:50.800
all about. So groceries are all of the food items that you need to buy at the supermarket so like

05:50.800 --> 05:57.680
your bread and milk and meat and vegetables. Exactly those are all groceries. Okay so let's listen

05:57.680 --> 06:09.360
to some examples on how we use this phrase. Example 1. There's no milk can you go to the grocery store?

06:12.640 --> 06:21.840
Example 2. Here's the grocery list. I need all of these things so that I can cook dinner tonight.

06:21.840 --> 06:34.960
Don't forget anything. Example 3. I hate grocery shopping. I can never find what I'm looking for.

06:39.360 --> 06:44.880
Okay great examples. We heard some really interesting combinations right? Yeah we heard grocery

06:44.880 --> 06:51.520
store which is where you buy your groceries. Exactly. Grocery shopping. Buying all your groceries.

06:52.560 --> 07:00.480
And grocery list. Where you have all the items that you need to buy. A list of everything you need to buy.

07:00.480 --> 07:07.440
Exactly. You know grocery store I think this is quite a common word in Canada. Probably North America.

07:07.440 --> 07:12.160
Yeah do you say grocery store in America? Well if it's a small one. Really so like a small store.

07:12.160 --> 07:17.680
In Canada I say grocery store for even like a supermarket. Really? Yeah. I guess well I would say

07:17.680 --> 07:22.160
supermarket for a large one and grocery store for a little corner shop. All of these little

07:22.160 --> 07:26.880
differences in American and Canadian English. Okay I think it's time for us to listen to our

07:26.880 --> 07:38.640
dialogue another time. This time it'll be a little bit slower. Honey the house is such a mess. I need

07:38.640 --> 07:45.280
you to help me tidy up a bit. My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house

07:45.520 --> 07:52.160
needs to be spotless. I'm in the middle of something right now. I'll be there in a second.

07:52.720 --> 07:59.360
This can't wait. I need your help now. All right all right. I'm coming.

08:00.960 --> 08:08.320
Okay here's a list of chores we need to get done. I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries

08:08.560 --> 08:14.880
for tonight. You can sweep and mop the floors. Oh and the furniture needs to be dusted.

08:15.840 --> 08:22.880
You know what? I have to pick something up at the mall. So why don't you clean the floors

08:22.880 --> 08:31.040
and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries. Sure that's fine. Here's the list of

08:31.040 --> 08:37.280
all the things you need to get. Don't forget anything and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your

08:37.280 --> 08:48.000
way home. Hey honey I'm back. Wow the house looks really good. Great. Can you set the table?

08:48.720 --> 08:56.560
Just a sec. I'm just gonna vacuum this rug real fast. Wait don't turn it on.

08:57.520 --> 09:10.400
Okay great stuff love hearing that explosion that vacuum just is a bomb. Yeah in this dialogue

09:10.400 --> 09:16.160
there was some really interesting language that you can use if you don't want to do any chores

09:16.160 --> 09:24.400
in the house. Exactly so it's time now for Fluency Builder. Fluency Builder. You know fluency

09:24.400 --> 09:31.360
builder is a part of our show that we use to take a common phrase or a word that you already know

09:31.360 --> 09:38.400
and show you how to express that idea more fluently and more naturally. Exactly so let's take a look

09:38.400 --> 09:44.560
at our first idea that we want to explain. Let's say you're watching TV like the woman in this

09:44.560 --> 09:52.160
dialogue and your husband wants you to help him do the chores and you say no I'm busy. Right or

09:52.800 --> 09:57.680
I'm doing something. Those are two great expressions but we heard something a little bit different

09:57.680 --> 10:06.960
in the dialogue. I'm in the middle of something right now. I'm in the middle of something right now.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.560
Yeah that phrase is great it means she's busy she's doing something. Yeah I'm in the middle of

10:12.560 --> 10:18.800
something. Yeah and so Marco you can tell us about our next phrase. Okay well now suppose that

10:18.880 --> 10:25.680
you want to say you'll be there soon. You might say I'll be there soon or I'm coming

10:25.680 --> 10:31.760
exactly but in our dialogue we heard something a little bit different. Let's listen. I'll be there

10:31.760 --> 10:39.920
in a second. I'll be there in a second. So this is a more natural way of saying I'll be there

10:39.920 --> 10:44.720
very soon. Yeah you know what I think I use this phrase almost every day I'll be there in a

10:44.720 --> 10:49.200
second. Yeah yeah it's really common. Yeah it means I'll be there really fast. Yes.

10:49.200 --> 10:56.400
Okay so our final item today in Fluency Builder is a great phrase that helps you say the idea

10:57.040 --> 11:04.320
could you or would you? Right or can you? Yeah so can you sweep the floor could you sweep the floor?

11:04.320 --> 11:08.320
But in the dialogue we heard something that's a little bit different.

11:09.200 --> 11:19.440
Why don't you clean the floors and I'll code the supermarket. Why don't you clean the floors and

11:19.440 --> 11:26.560
I'll code the supermarket. Great so this is more natural and it's giving a suggestion. Yeah it's

11:26.560 --> 11:31.520
sort of a polite way of asking someone to clean the floors. Right it's a really good and polite way

11:31.520 --> 11:36.720
of saying it. Yeah I would agree on that. This was Fluency Builder. Now we are ready to listen to our

11:36.720 --> 11:42.080
dialogue again at its normal speed. And this time you'll understand a lot better.

11:51.120 --> 11:57.360
Honey the house is such a mess. I need you to help me tidy up a bit. My boss and her husband are

11:57.360 --> 12:02.800
coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless. I'm in the middle of something right now.

12:03.760 --> 12:10.240
I'll be there in a second. This can't wait. I need your help now. All right. All right I'm coming.

12:11.280 --> 12:15.680
Okay here's a list of chores we need to get done. I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries

12:15.680 --> 12:20.080
for tonight. You can sweep and mop the floors. Oh and the furniture needs to be dusted.

12:20.720 --> 12:26.000
You know what? I have to pick something up in the mall so why don't you clean the floors

12:26.000 --> 12:30.800
and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries. Sure that's fine. Here's the list of

12:30.800 --> 12:36.160
all the things you need to get. Don't forget anything and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your

12:36.160 --> 12:48.240
way home? Hey honey I'm back. Wow the house looks really good. Great. Can you set the table?

12:49.920 --> 12:55.040
Just a sec. I'm just going to vacuum this rug wheel fast. Wait don't turn it on.

13:01.760 --> 13:14.400
Um has has this ever happened to you? Has your vacuum cleaner exploded in your house?

13:14.400 --> 13:19.760
Well not a big explosion like this one. Not so dramatically and not so dramatically but

13:20.640 --> 13:25.760
I've had this happen to me before yeah and dust everywhere and it's just it's a mess you don't

13:25.760 --> 13:33.760
want to have. You know this word vacuum is really a very American word. Yeah vacuum vacuum the rug

13:33.760 --> 13:39.920
vacuum the carpet. Yeah vacuum cleaner. In the UK what did they say? Hoover. Hoover. Yeah Hoover. Hoover

13:39.920 --> 13:46.080
the rug. Hoover the rug which is interesting because it's actually a brand. Yeah so I guess it's

13:46.080 --> 13:51.600
kind of like American English you say pass me a Kleenex. Oh that's true. That would be like a tissue.

13:51.600 --> 13:57.760
Yeah so I guess they say Hoover the rug or Hoover the house. Yeah wow you know I really love

13:57.760 --> 14:02.880
these small differences in meaning that we have between American English and British English.

14:02.880 --> 14:08.160
Yeah it's it's fun. Okay well another interesting thing about this is that the man was doing

14:08.160 --> 14:14.320
the house work. I know he's a house husband. Yeah so he's the one doing all the chores in the house.

14:14.320 --> 14:20.160
Yeah that's well that's the new trend now now it's more popular for men to stay home and take care

14:20.160 --> 14:26.880
of the babies and clean the house. Yeah like when I was growing up my dad would take out the garbage

14:26.880 --> 14:33.040
and that was it. My mom had to do everything else but now I think it's becoming a lot more common

14:33.040 --> 14:38.400
in especially in North America for the household chores to be divided between the man and the wife

14:38.400 --> 14:44.080
equally. Yeah I think it's fair. It's me too. Yeah you'd make a good husband Marko. That's what they

14:44.080 --> 14:50.240
say but they haven't married me yet. Okay all right well we're out of time folks be sure to log

14:50.240 --> 14:54.880
on to our community website and you can leave all your comments and maybe other house husbands

14:54.880 --> 14:59.040
out there can give us their feedback on what they think about this. Yeah so check us out at

14:59.040 --> 15:05.760
englishpod.com and thanks for listening today everyone until next time this is Marco and Erica saying

15:05.760 --> 15:14.960
bye. Good bye.
