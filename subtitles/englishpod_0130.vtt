00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello English learners. Welcome back to English pod. My name is Marco.

00:06.500 --> 00:11.000
And my name is Katherine and today I think we're hitting the gym at Marco.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
We need to be healthy. We've gained weight over the winter I think.

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
I think so and being an office, you know, it doesn't give you much opportunity to go and exercise and really get a lot of work.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Exactly. That's why we're going to the gym on this occasion.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
We're going to be pumping some iron. We're going to be working out.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
So why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview and see what this means.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Very calorie preview.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
All right. So to pump iron. What does that mean?

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
All right. Well, to pumping iron means lifting weights.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Okay. So we're pumping iron. We're lifting weights.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
You know, weights are made of iron. Right. So it makes them so heavy.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
All right. So we're pumping iron. Good.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
And well, we're going to be giving you guys some pointers.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Pointers. Right. All right. So you might have heard the word point before.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Well, pointers is another word for tips.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
All right. So we're going to be giving you tips or advice.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah. So you're going to get some help today from the trainer.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
All right. So we're going to jump right into this dialogue and we come back.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Let me talk more about what's going on.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Hey there. You look a little lost. Are you new here?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Yeah. How did you know?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
You can always spot the newbies. I can give you a few pointers if you want.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Will you try to use this machine here? Yeah. I just started my training today.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
And I'm not sure what to begin.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
It's okay. I know how it is.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
This machine here will work out your upper body,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
mailing your triceps and biceps.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps and 4 sets.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
5 kilo weight should be enough.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron. You might pull a muscle.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Got it.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Wow. Is that the weight you're lifting?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
My kidneys. That's a waste.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
It's not that much. Just watch.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Okay.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
So this guy was a little bit arrogant.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
I think he was very, you know, very muscular,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
but I think he embarrass himself in front of the lady.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
The trainer, you mean? Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
So he, we say he had a big ego.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
He thought a lot about himself.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
So let's check out some of these phrases and words they were using

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
because they're all related to going at the gym.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And they can help you if you ever want to get some help when you're at the gym.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
So this girl, she was new in the gym. She didn't really know what she was doing.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
And well, the guy said, well, do you want to develop strength or muscle tone?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
All right. We know it's strength is, but what is muscle tone?

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Okay. So if you want to develop muscle tone or to have muscle tone,

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
it means that you have healthy muscles, not like huge big muscle, right?

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
But you have a nice body.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Right. So tone to tone is to maybe give some shape to something.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
It's, you know, sometimes you have big arms and they're not really.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
You can't see the muscles. Well, muscle tone means that you can start to see the shape

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
and they start to get stronger.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
All right. So if you think of Madonna maybe five years ago,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
she had a lot of muscle tone. Now she's like,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh, big muscle.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
But muscle tone means that you can see the muscles.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
They start to develop. Okay.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
And this actually is very related to our next word because he said,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
muscle tone and definition.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Right. So definition is another way for us to describe seeing those muscles.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Because at first you have big tummy or you have big arms.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
And when you start to work out every time you go,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
you can see more and more definition.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
That means more and more than muscle becomes visible.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
All right. So you have defined muscles.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
All right. Good. Now the girl was like, no,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I don't want to be like super strong and huge, right?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
She doesn't want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah. Exactly.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
She said, I just want a good physique.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
All right. This word maybe sounds strange for some of you,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
because it kind of sounds French.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
More like French than English. Yeah. Well, it does come from French.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
And physique is a way to talk about the whole body.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
You know, the physique is the,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
the state of your whole body.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
It's your physical appearance.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Okay. So I can say,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
she has a nice physique.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Mm-hmm. So that means she's probably works out a lot.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
So, but basically it's like her whole body, right?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
You can just say like,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
she has, she has good physique in her arms or something like that.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
No, no, you're physique.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Physical thing of the word physical.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
It's your whole body.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Your whole body. All right. So good physique.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
And now the tips that he was giving her or the pointers,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
he was talking about these two words, reps and sets.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Right. These are great words for the gym

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
because they allow us to count when we're working out.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Mm-hmm. So the first one is reps or repetitions.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Mm-hmm.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I mean, it's doing something over and over again.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Mm-hmm. So for example, if I want to lift a weight,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I sit down in the bench.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
I do one, two, three.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
How many times I lift that weight is a repetition or a wrap?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
All right. And what about sets?

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
So I could say, I lift the weight 10 times,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
one, two, three, four.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
All the way to 10.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And then I wait and then I do it again.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
So the number of times I do it again is a set.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Okay.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
So sets of 10 or sets of five.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Okay. So if you are lifting this weight 10 times,

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
and you have five sets, you will do a total of 50.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Pushes or lifts or, yeah, repetition.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Okay. So reps and sets are probably the most important

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
or common words you'll hear in the gym,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
especially if you're lifting weights, right?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Mm-hmm. Definitely. And sometimes your trainer will count with you,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
so that he'll keep account all you're working out.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Cool. So those are the words that we have for you on language takeaway.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
I think in order to better understand these words,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
we should listen to our dialogue again,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
but we're going to slow it down just a little bit.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Hey there, you look a little lost. Are you new here?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, how did you know?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
You can always spot the newbies.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Were you trying to use this machine here?

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah. I just started my training today.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm not really sure what to begin.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
It's okay. I know how it is.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
This machine here will work out your upper body,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
mainly your triceps and biceps.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Well, I don't want to be rips like you.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
I just want to go to physique with weights and cardio.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in four sets.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Five kilo weights should be enough.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
or you might pull a muscle.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Got it.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Wow, is that the weight you're lifting?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
It's not that much. Just watch.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm okay.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Alright, so you might have heard some other phrases in there

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
that sound interesting or new to you.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
And that's what we're going to go into the fluency builder part of lesson.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
We can talk about sounding more fluent in English.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Fluency builder.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Alright, so the girl, she was a little bit lost.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
So this guy was trying to help her out.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I think it was her first time in the gym.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
It was, and she doesn't really know where to start,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
which is a common problem for people who go to the gym for the first time.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
So the guy said, well, yeah, I know how it is.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
How what is?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Exactly. How what?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
It's very strange phrase because it's vague. It's not clear.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
So what is he referring to?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
There's something very common that we say in English.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
To mean, I understand your situation.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
I know how you feel.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I know how you feel.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
So she says, this is my first time.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
I don't know what to do, and he says, I know how it is.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I understand your situation.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Right, because I imagine the first time he went to the gym,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
he felt the same way.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Exactly. I could say, I'm so lost.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
I'm new at this school.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I don't even know anyone.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah, I know how it is.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I was new here last year, so trust me.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I know how it is.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Okay, so Marco and I have similar situations,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
although he has already experienced it.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
So he can help me out.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
This is a good phrase.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
It's actually, I think it's very common for somebody

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
to kind of sympathize with you, huh?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Absolutely.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And it's a really good phrase if you want to help someone

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
who looks lost or confused.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
So if someone joins your work,

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
if you have a new colleague,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
and I say, oh, I don't know where anything is.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't know how this,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
how to do anything at my job.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
You say, oh, I don't know how it is.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I always know here last month.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Mm-hmm.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Great.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And well, now they were talking about, you know,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
lifting weights in the physique.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
And she said this interesting word.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
She says, I don't want to be ripped like you.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Okay.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
So many of you have probably heard the other meaning

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
of the word to rip or ripped.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
So this is to rip.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, to tear.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
But in this case, it's an adjective.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
It's a way to describe someone's physique.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Their body.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
And we're talking about people who are very, very muscular.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Okay.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
So basically body builders.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Arnold Schwarzenegger is ripped.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
He has ripped huge muscles.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Madonna is ripped.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
She has huge muscles.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Okay.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
So it's a very informal way, but it's a very informal way of saying,

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
very muscular.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, it's someone who works out a lot.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
All right.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
You're ripped.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
And after this, we've got one more phrase.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
It's actually very important because when we talk about going to the gym,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
working out, we have to talk about safety and your health as well.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It's very easy to hurt yourself.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Right.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And that's what we want to avoid.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
You don't want to pull a muscle.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
All right.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Pull a muscle.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
This is a key phrase here because we have a special combination of verb.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
And now the thing that we pull is our muscle.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
And what we do to it is we pull it.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
That means we hurt it.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
So if you don't stretch and you're lifting weights,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
maybe your muscle will start to hurt and you can't lift anymore.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
You hurt it.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
You pulled your muscle.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Or often runners have this problem.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
They don't stretch before they run or they run too much.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And they have a lot of pain in their muscles.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
You say, I pulled a muscle.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
Now, I think there's another way of saying it also is to tear a muscle, right?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Tears more serious.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
More serious.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
A tear is like a little rip in your muscle and you should really see a doctor about that.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Okay.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
So we don't want you to pull a muscle or to tear a muscle.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
So be sure to stretch.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
But we have some more examples with this phrase to pull a muscle.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
So let's listen.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Example one.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
Muscle strains also called pull muscles are common sports injuries.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Example two.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
If you do not warm up before physical activity, you can easily pull a muscle.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Example three.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Anyone can pull a muscle because of overuse.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Muscle fatigue or through a fall.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
All right.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
So now that that's clear, I think we can listen to our gym dialogue one more time

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
and see what happens to this arrogant body doing.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Absolutely.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Hey there.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
You look a little lost.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Are you new here?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
How did you know?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
You can always spot the newbies.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Will you try to use this machine here?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I just started my training today and I'm not sure what to begin.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
It's okay.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I know how it is.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
This machine here will work out your upper body.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Mailing your triceps and biceps.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone in definition?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
I just want to good fizzy with weights and cardio.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
In that case, you want to work with the last weight.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps and 4 sets.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
5 kilo weight should be enough.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
You might pull a muscle.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Got it.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Wow.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
That's the weight you're lifting.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
My kidneys.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
That's a waste.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It's not that much.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Just watch.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Okay.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Alright Catherine.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
So we know that you are a very healthy person.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
You often go to the gym.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
This is true.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I like to go to the gym.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
So any gym stories?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Oh gosh.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I have lots of gym stories.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I like to run.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
And I often use the treadmill.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
And I've never really understood the people who don't run on the treadmill.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
People who stand.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Or who walk on the treadmill.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I remember.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
My gym is usually very crowded.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I remember one time.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I was at my gym and I wanted to run on the treadmill.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I had a long day at work.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And I had to go out afterwards.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
So I didn't have much time.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I only had an hour.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
And I really wanted to run.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
But there's a line for the treadmill.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
There are too many people.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
And this particular day I was waiting and waiting and waiting.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
And finally was my turn.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
And I stepped and a woman cut in front of me.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
No.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
She cut in front of me.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
And I was so angry.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
And what did she do?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
In her heels.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Heels.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Heels.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Big shoes.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
She walked for 40 minutes.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh my god.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
You could go outside and walk.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
I want to run.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
But she was wearing heels at the gym.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Wow.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Well, I guess you have to look nice when you go to the gym.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Apparently.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Well, it is a very popular place for people to meet, right?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
It is.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
They say after the office, the gym is one of the most common places for people to meet their

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
boyfriend and girlfriend.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Wow.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
So there's another good reason why you should go to the gym.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Absolutely.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
All right.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
So that's all the time we have for today.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
But we would like to hear if you have any questions, any doubts or comments.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
So come to our site EnglishPod.com.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
And if you have any gym stories, we'd also like to hear those.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
So that's going to do it for us until next time everyone.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Bye.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Bye.
