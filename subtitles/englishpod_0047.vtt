00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello English Literars, welcome back to English Pot, my name is Marko.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
And we're bringing you a very advanced lesson today.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
That's right.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
We're talking about another business topic, aren't we?

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
It's a topic that's kind of popular these days, all about efficiency and reducing costs.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
So we're going to be talking about the just in time philosophy.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
I don't know much about this philosophy, so a good thing we got Marko here.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Well, what we are going to be looking at is not really in depth.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
We're just going to be looking at some basic points of what just in time philosophy would be like in the company.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
But what we're really going to be looking at is the language to do with this philosophy.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
Exactly, we're going to be looking at some technical terms and some other useful phrases that you can use when you're talking in a business setting.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Okay, well, why don't we get started with the language then?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Okay, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm vocabulary preview today.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
We have the word lead time.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Lead time.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Lead time.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Lead time.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
L-E-A-D lead.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Lead time.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Right.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Like lead.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
This is something that factories usually would use.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
I guess lead time is the time in between point A and point B on a production schedule, right?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Right.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
So you could have, for example, production lead time.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
So that's the time between when you make an order and when the product is finished.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Exactly.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
And you could also have delivery lead time.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
So the time between when you place an order and when the product gets delivered to you.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
So depending on the companies you have differently time somewhere three days,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
or there are five days, or there are 45 days.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
And we at English Pod have a two week lead time for our podcast, right?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
But our delivery lead time is every other day.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
That's true.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Nice.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Okay.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
That's all we're going to be previewing today.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Just listen to the dialogue.

01:52.000 --> 02:05.000
And then we'll come back and explain some of these tricky vocabulary words that we'll see.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan, as I'm sure you're all aware,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
with the credit crunch and the global financial crisis.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
We're obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods.

02:17.000 --> 02:25.000
We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies, so we've outlined a brief plan to implement the just in time philosophy.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
We have two basic points that we want to focus on.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Why would we want to do that?

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
I think this is not an idea that really needs to be walked home.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better overall efficiency.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Right.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
Reducing Q length, like, for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed that are given machine.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
And improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
Possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to factory or working with a faster shipping company.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I see.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
That makes sense.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items, and therefore they must be eliminated.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I'm waiting on this one.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
It's essential that we reduce these errors.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And for suppliers to reduce that mistakes.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Exactly.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
First.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Okay, so they're going to implement just in time in their company.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yes.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah, I guess they're putting in some cost control measures.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So Marko, there's some great language in here.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Why don't we look at it now in language takeaway?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Language takeaway.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Okay, the first word today.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Redundancy.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Redundancy.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Redundancy.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Redundancy.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
So this is kind of a strange word because usually a redundancy is when you're speaking, right?

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, maybe when you say something that's already been said.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Exactly.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
You say something that has already been said, but we also use it in the business world.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Right.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
And it comes from the base word redundant, right?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Okay.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm meaning extra more than what's needed.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Okay.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
So when a person or position is made redundant, basically it means they get laid off, right?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Right.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
So redundancies are a synonym of layoffs.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Exactly.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Okay.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
All right.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Let's take a look at our next word.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Workstations.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Workstations.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Workstations.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Workstations.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
So workstation could be anything from your desk.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Or maybe a workbench.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
A workbench.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Or even a place on a production line.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Right.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
So you're a certain machine or something like that.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So basically a workstation is the area where you work.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Okay.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Okay.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
So you can say, can we get a new workstation for the new team member?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Mm-hmm.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Or I could say, I want to move my workstation closer to my employees.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
All right.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
So workstation.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Mm-hmm.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Okay.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Let's take a look at our next word.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Add a given machine.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Add a given machine.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Add a given.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Add a given.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
This is an interesting way to say at any machine.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Exactly.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Okay.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Given here is operating exactly the same as here.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
The word given is operating exactly the same way as any.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
As any.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Okay.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
So let's listen to some examples of how we can change it up a little bit and we can use this given word.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Example one.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
In this factory, how many cars are in production at any given time?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Example two.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
On any given day, about 40 million people use the internet.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Example three.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
Firefighters have to be ready to attend an emergency at any given moment.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
All right.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
So any given time at any given moment?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yep.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Um, any given day?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Okay.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Now let's take a look at our last word today.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Defective.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Defective.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Defective.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Defective.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
So if something is defective, it has a problem with it.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
It has a problem.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
We can say defective is an adjective.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Right.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And the noun is defect.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
So if something has a defect, it is defective.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Right.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
So for example, maybe you produce chairs and you make one and this chair is missing a wheel.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Okay.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
So it's defective.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Yes.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
The defect is the missing wheel.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
The defect is the missing.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Okay.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
So before we listen to our dialogue again, I want to take a look at this phrase.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm with you on this one.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm with you on this one.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I'm with you on this one.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm with you on this one.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
So what is that?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
What does that mean exactly?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm with you on this one.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I agree with you.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
I agree with you on this point.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Exactly.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Okay.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
So if you agree with somebody on a certain point, you would say,

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Oh, I'm with you on this one.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I agree with you.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Exactly.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Okay.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
So now let's listen to our dialogue again.

07:27.000 --> 07:44.000
And we'll come back and talk a little bit more about the history of this just in time.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan,

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
as I'm sure you're all aware, with the credit crunch and the global financial crisis.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
We're obligated to look for more cost-efficient ways of producing our goods.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies,

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
so we've outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
We have two basic points that we want to focus on.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Why would we want to do that?

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
I think this is not an idea that really needs to be walked home.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Well, we want to reduce production and deliver lead times for better overall efficiency.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Right.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Reducing Q length like, for example,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed that are given machine.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
And improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to factory,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
or working with a faster shipping company.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I see.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
That makes sense.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero-defect's

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
quality program.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
and therefore, they must be eliminated.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers personal responsibility

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
for the quality of the work they do,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm way beyond this one.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
It's essential that we reduce these errors.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
We've got two false suppliers to reduce that mistakes.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Exactly.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
First.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
All right.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
So Markle, I mentioned at the beginning of the lesson that I don't know much about Justin

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Time, but luckily you did, right?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I know a little bit about it.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
So tell me a little bit about where this philosophy came from.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
What are the origins of this idea?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It actually became really popular with Toyota,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
and it was called the Toyota Production System.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So many people think it's Japanese,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
but in reality, the Japanese got it from the United States.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
It's a philosophy that was thought up by Ford Motor Company

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
in order to improve their production line.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
But when the Japanese visited Ford Motor Company,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
it wasn't fully implemented yet,

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
and oddly enough, they found this philosophy working already in a pigly wiggly.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
What's a pigly wiggly?

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Pigly wiggly was a chain of grocery stores in the United States.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Okay.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm not sure if they're still around,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
but yeah, they were really big,

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
and basically pigly wiggly was using this to improve their whole system of shipping,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
and of stocking and everything.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay, so how does it work?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
So basically what you try to do is

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
make your processes more efficient,

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
reduce the amount of space you're using, et cetera.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
And this was really important for Japanese because,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
of course, they don't have that much space in Japan

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
to have this huge warehouses like in other countries.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
So what you're saying is they're producing goods

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
just for the time they need it, right?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Exactly, so trying to not be overstocked,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
or have like a long lead time.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Long lead times where you have to keep something in a warehouse,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
exactly.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
So that's why it's so efficient.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
And also it's about improving the efficiency between processes.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
So what sometimes called a bottleneck,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
you can have really good processes in the beginning.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
But in the end, maybe you have only one workstation

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
that's taking all these orders and everything gets bottled up

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
and it causes delays.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
So in the dialogue, they want to implement

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
the just-in-time strategy as a way of avoiding redundancies.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
But it sounds to me like actually this might cause redundancies sometimes.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Well, yeah, sometimes it does.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Sometimes when you make workstations more efficient

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
or when you make all your processes work more fluidly,

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
sometimes inevitably you will have to lay off some people

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
that are redundant.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Okay, have you ever worked in a company

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
where they've implemented just in time?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
No, actually I've never really worked at a place

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
where this philosophy was working.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
But I did use to work at a place where we had six sigma,

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
which is kind of, which is a little bit similar.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Well, I guess we'll need a lesson on six sigma now.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, we'll see if we come up with six sigma and what it means

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
and it's kind of interesting.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
But we want to hear what you think.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
Yes, have you guys worked in a place where they use just in time?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Exactly.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Or if you have any quality control measures

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
or how does your company avoid having defective items

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
or defective services?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
