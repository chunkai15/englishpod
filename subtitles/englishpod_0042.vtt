00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.680 --> 00:10.400
And I'm Erica, and today with Erica, we're bringing you a great lesson about time.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.880
You need more of it. We need more time, right?

00:12.880 --> 00:16.240
So we're going to be teaching you how you can ask for more time.

00:16.240 --> 00:20.320
If you're working on a project at work and you can't finish it on time,

00:20.320 --> 00:23.680
you have to ask your boss for more time.

00:23.680 --> 00:29.440
Right. So today in our dialogue, Casey needs more time to put together a press kit.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.320
What's the press kits? Good question.

00:32.320 --> 00:36.160
A press kit is something the marketing department will put together,

00:36.160 --> 00:41.280
basically pictures, logos, uh, uh, information about the company.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.280
Mm-hmm. So when a newspaper or a magazine wants to write an article about them,

00:45.280 --> 00:48.720
so they have something already prepared that they could give the newspaper or a magazine.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.680
Okay. Okay. So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.480
And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, so it might be a little bit difficult to understand.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.080
Welcome back in one minute and tell you about some of the key language.

01:10.720 --> 01:16.800
So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

01:17.600 --> 01:20.800
Yeah, I've been meeting the talk to you about that.

01:21.520 --> 01:24.560
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.560
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.040
Why are things delayed?

01:31.040 --> 01:35.760
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

01:35.760 --> 01:40.640
I'm not looking for excuses here. I just want to get this finished on time.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.680
I know. And I apologize for the delay.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.400
But some things were just beyond my control.

01:46.400 --> 01:51.200
I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks.

01:51.200 --> 01:56.480
So I couldn't include him in the photos. And the design team lost all the files,

01:56.480 --> 01:58.800
so I had to redo the pictures.

01:58.800 --> 02:04.240
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey. I want those photos ASAP.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.320
All right. So Casey is in trouble, I think.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.600
Yeah, I think her boss is pretty upset. Yeah.

02:16.560 --> 02:21.600
Well, let's take a look at some of the language that we saw in this dialogue in language takeaway.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.240
Language takeaway.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.000
First word today is deadline deadline deadline.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.640
Deadline. So Erica, what's a deadline?

02:33.200 --> 02:36.880
It is the last possible date to do something.

02:36.880 --> 02:41.680
So for example, when we were in school, our teacher would send us homework and say it was for Friday.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.280
So the deadline was Friday.

02:44.240 --> 02:48.880
Right. Or when you're at work, you have projects that you have to finish by a certain date.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.880
That's your deadline. Exactly.

02:50.880 --> 02:56.400
Okay. Let's look at our next word, extension extension extension extension extension.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.320
extension. So extension and deadline go together, right?

03:00.320 --> 03:08.160
Exactly. If you can't reach your deadline or you can't make your deadline, you must ask for an extension.

03:08.720 --> 03:14.960
So you ask for more time. Yeah. An extension is moving the deadline in the future.

03:14.960 --> 03:25.040
All right. Interesting. Let's look at our next word, ran into, ran into, ran into some problems.

03:25.040 --> 03:30.560
So we ran into some problems in this dialogue. Let's listen to some more examples of running

03:30.640 --> 03:38.320
to so we can understand the meaning. Example one. We ran into a storm on our way home.

03:41.360 --> 03:48.000
Example two. If you're not careful now, you're going to run into a lot of problems later.

03:51.120 --> 03:57.360
Example three. I ran into some trouble with my computer.

03:57.600 --> 04:05.520
Okay. Good example. So it's clear now, right? Right. If you run into problems, you meet some problems.

04:05.520 --> 04:10.640
Right. Many students say it in that way. I met some problems. Yeah, but that's wrong.

04:10.640 --> 04:16.560
Right. So you would say I ran into some problems. I met some problems is wrong, wrong, wrong.

04:17.360 --> 04:22.160
Okay. Don't say met some problems. I ran into some problems. I ran into. Okay.

04:22.800 --> 04:30.080
And our last word for language takeaway delayed delayed delayed delayed delayed. So when something is

04:30.080 --> 04:38.320
delayed, it's late late and the opposite is on time. Yeah. So your flight was delayed or your flight was

04:38.320 --> 04:45.280
on time. The project was delayed or your project was on time. There. All right. So now let's go back to the

04:45.280 --> 04:50.400
dialogue. Let's listen to it again. And this time it will be a little bit slower. So you can understand

04:50.400 --> 05:05.840
some of these phrases we just talked about. So, Casey, how are things going with the photos

05:05.840 --> 05:12.960
for the press kit? Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. I might need to ask for an

05:12.960 --> 05:20.240
extension on that deadline. You've had over a month to get this finalized. Why are things delayed?

05:20.960 --> 05:28.400
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems. I'm not looking for excuses here. I just want

05:28.400 --> 05:35.840
to get this finished on time. I know. And I apologize for the delay. But some things were just

05:35.840 --> 05:42.080
beyond my control. I had trouble booking a photographer and then Michael was sick for three weeks.

05:42.080 --> 05:49.600
So I couldn't include him in the photos. And the design team lost all the files. So I had to redo

05:49.600 --> 05:57.440
the pictures. I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey. I want those photos ASAP.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.760
Okay, so there were some really useful phrases that we saw in this dialogue.

06:07.760 --> 06:13.440
Yeah, some wonderful phrases that you can use when you want to ask for more time. Okay, so let's

06:13.440 --> 06:19.520
look at these phrases in fluency builder. Fluency builder. All right, what's our first phrase?

06:20.240 --> 06:28.240
I've been meaning to talk to you. I've been meaning to. I've been meaning to. Okay, we have some really

06:28.240 --> 06:34.800
great examples of how you can combine. I've been meaning to with different verbs. Yeah, let's listen.

06:35.680 --> 06:42.800
Example one. I'm sorry I haven't called you yet. I've been meaning to, but I've been busy.

06:46.080 --> 06:52.800
Example two. I've been meaning to tell you, but don't quit yesterday.

06:56.720 --> 07:02.800
Example three. I've been meaning to see that film for a while.

07:05.760 --> 07:12.320
I've been meaning to go to that restaurant, but I haven't had time. So you've been wanting to for a long time.

07:12.320 --> 07:17.920
I've been thinking about it. I've been planning to do it. But you just haven't done it. I haven't done it.

07:17.920 --> 07:24.560
Because I haven't had time or money. Mm-hmm. Okay. Good phrase. Our next phrase is

07:25.600 --> 07:33.600
beyond my control. Beyond my control. It's beyond my control. So it means that I can't control it.

07:33.760 --> 07:38.080
You can't do anything about it. Can't do anything about it. The weather is beyond my control.

07:38.080 --> 07:44.400
Right. Or relate with this project because Jane was sick for one month. It was beyond my control.

07:44.400 --> 07:50.400
Okay. It wasn't your fault. No. Okay. And our last phrase for Pluency Builder.

07:50.960 --> 07:57.680
Put this off. Put this off. Put this off. Put this off.

07:58.320 --> 08:03.600
So let's listen to some more examples of put this off before we explain the meaning.

08:04.240 --> 08:12.000
Example one. I've been putting off this project for a week. And it's due tomorrow.

08:15.360 --> 08:22.800
Example two. Can we put off our meeting till next week? I'm too busy right now.

08:23.760 --> 08:35.040
Example three. I've been putting off my email all day. And now I have 50 messages to respond to.

08:37.040 --> 08:44.080
So Marco, when you put something off you leave it for later. Okay. Right. So maybe I have to write a report today.

08:44.640 --> 08:49.840
But I'm going to put it off till tomorrow. So you're going to do it tomorrow. I'll do it tomorrow.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.960
Okay. So we've seen some really great words and some really good phrases. So now let's listen to our

08:54.960 --> 08:58.240
dialogue for the last time. And then we'll come back and talk some more.

09:04.240 --> 09:10.320
So Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

09:11.040 --> 09:18.000
Yeah. I've been meaning to talk to you about that. I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

09:18.720 --> 09:23.600
You've had over a month to get this finalized. Why are things delayed?

09:24.400 --> 09:31.360
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems. I'm not looking for excuses here.

09:31.360 --> 09:36.560
I just want to get this finished on time. I know. And I apologize for the delay.

09:37.200 --> 09:42.800
But some things were just beyond my control. I had trouble booking the photographer. And then

09:42.800 --> 09:48.480
Michael was sick for three weeks. So I couldn't include him in the photos. And the design team

09:48.480 --> 09:55.200
lost all the files. So I had to redo the pictures. I'm not going to put this off any longer Casey.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.680
I want those photos ASAP.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.080
Marco, do you think that Casey's reasons for being late are good?

10:09.040 --> 10:14.800
I think so because it wasn't really her fault. The whole situation with the photographer.

10:14.800 --> 10:20.000
And then one of her co-workers was sick for three weeks. Yeah. It's not really her fault, right?

10:20.000 --> 10:25.760
Right. But maybe the boss thinks that she's making excuses. Yeah, maybe she's making excuses.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.920
That's really common. Like for example, when we were kids, you would say, oh, you know,

10:29.920 --> 10:33.840
my dog ate my homework. Right. But that really happened to me once.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.240
Your dog ate your homework. My cat ate my homework. Your cat ate your homework.

10:38.240 --> 10:42.560
Yeah. And what did your teachers say? Well, actually, I was a really good student. So my teacher

10:42.560 --> 10:47.920
believed me. Well, my teacher wouldn't have believed me. Really? No, no, she would have

10:48.560 --> 10:53.040
she would have called my parents most likely. Well, my cat really did eat my homework. And I just

10:53.040 --> 10:57.120
left it on the table and it chewed it all up. That's weird. Why would your cat do that? I don't know.

10:57.760 --> 11:02.400
A lot of weird excuses out there. Yeah. I was abducted by aliens. Uh-huh.

11:02.400 --> 11:07.760
My mom accidentally mailed my homework to Africa. Really? Yeah, that's happened to you.

11:07.760 --> 11:14.720

11:14.720 --> 11:19.920
