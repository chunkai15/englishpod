00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.680
And I'm Erica.

00:06.680 --> 00:10.080
And today with Erica we have an upper intermediate lesson.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.280
That's right, an upper intermediate lesson that's a little bit strange.

00:13.280 --> 00:17.560
It's a little bit strange but it's a real English lesson because that's what we give

00:17.560 --> 00:18.880
you here at EnglishPod.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.520
So in today's lesson we've got a lot of really great language for you.

00:22.520 --> 00:26.560
We've got language to help you to gossip better.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.560
Gossip?

00:27.560 --> 00:29.560
Why don't you explain it a little bit just in case.

00:29.560 --> 00:37.560
Okay, so if I gossip, I maybe share news or information about other people with my friends.

00:37.560 --> 00:42.360
Like I might say something like, Marco, did you see what happened in ChinesePod today?

00:42.360 --> 00:44.880
You'll never guess what I saw.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.520
Exactly, that's gossip.

00:46.520 --> 00:50.440
And we also have language today to describe things.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.760
To describe strange things.

00:52.760 --> 00:53.760
Strange things.

00:53.760 --> 00:58.160
All right, so let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.320
Vocabulary preview.

01:00.120 --> 01:04.800
So in our vocabulary preview, we'll look at a few important words that will help you

01:04.800 --> 01:08.120
to understand the dialogue a little bit better.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.120
Exactly.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.120
And the first word is weird.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.120
Weird.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.120
Weird.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.120
Weird.

01:15.120 --> 01:20.440
Now this is a common word you'd probably hear all the time in a lot of different situations.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.160
So we wanted to explain it today.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.960
Yeah, this word just means strange.

01:24.960 --> 01:25.960
It's strange.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.000
Weird person is a strange person.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Exactly.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.200
But the thing about this word is if you are a young person, let's say under the age of 35,

01:34.200 --> 01:37.000
you'll probably use it about 100 times a day.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Weird.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
It's just such a good sounding word.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Weird.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
It is.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.880
Okay, but the thing is that even though it's probably more commonly used in American English,

01:48.880 --> 01:51.280
it's still widely used for British English as well.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.600
Yeah, that's true.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.840
So, but maybe in British English you would say something like, odd.

01:56.840 --> 01:57.840
It's odd.

01:57.840 --> 01:58.840
That's more common.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.920
Okay, let's look at our second word, housewarming gift.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.400
Housewarming gift.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.880
Housewarming gift.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.200
Housewarming gift.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.480
Now this is a cultural thing.

02:08.480 --> 02:12.840
It's really common in North America to give a housewarming gift to someone.

02:12.840 --> 02:17.800
Yeah, if I move into a new house, maybe some of my friends or family will bring a gift

02:17.800 --> 02:21.040
over to make my house a little bit more beautiful.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.560
So something like a photo frame or...

02:23.600 --> 02:28.560
Or maybe a plant or sometimes even like maybe a basket of pastries or something.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.560
Oh, okay.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.560
Yeah.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.560
I've never gotten one of those because I don't have a home.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.560
Oh.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.560
Where do you live on this street?

02:34.560 --> 02:37.560
Well, I don't have my own home, so I had never gotten one of those.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.560
Okay.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.560
Okay, so we're ready now to listen to our dialogue.

02:41.560 --> 02:46.120
So we've got two housewives who are gossiping about what's going on in the neighborhood and

02:46.120 --> 02:53.120
let's listen to what happens.

02:53.120 --> 02:59.120
Oh, I don't know if you've heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.120
Yeah, I know.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.640
I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
His name is Armand.

03:04.640 --> 03:05.640
Really?

03:05.640 --> 03:06.640
What's he like?

03:06.640 --> 03:08.640
You have to fill me in.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.640
Actually, he's a bit strange.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.640
I don't know.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.640
I've just got a bad feeling about him.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.640
Really?

03:14.640 --> 03:15.640
Why?

03:15.640 --> 03:20.680
Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird

03:20.680 --> 03:23.400
and then he practically kicked me out.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.480
I tried to sort of peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't

03:27.480 --> 03:28.880
really get a good look.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.640
The whole thing really creeped me out.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.880
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

03:32.880 --> 03:37.640
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.640
It almost looked like a coffin.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.640
You see?

03:41.640 --> 03:42.640
Why could he?

03:42.640 --> 03:43.640
Oh, ladies.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.640
Armand!

03:44.640 --> 03:46.920
Oh, you scared the heck out of me.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.400
This is my friend Doris.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.400
I'm pleasure to meet you.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.000
If you're not doing anything tonight, I'd like to have you both for dinner.

03:54.000 --> 04:02.240
I mean, I'd like to have you both over for dinner.

04:02.240 --> 04:11.520
Ooh, that guy seems kind of weird.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.200
You can hear his voice is like a weird guy, right?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
Yeah.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
All right.

04:16.200 --> 04:22.960
Let's take a look at our language takeaway and look at some of these great words.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.200
Language takeaway.

04:25.200 --> 04:31.040
So our language takeaway focuses on several words from the dialogue that we feel are really

04:31.040 --> 04:32.640
important for you to know.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.640
Exactly.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.240
And we have four of them for you today.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.560
Why don't we look at the first one?

04:36.560 --> 04:37.560
Okay.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.440
So the first word is a bad feeling.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
Bad feeling.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.440
A bad feeling.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.760
A bad feeling.

04:43.760 --> 04:51.040
So we've got a few examples that will help you to understand how this phrase works.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.680
Example 1.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.680
I don't like Kelly's new boyfriend.

04:56.680 --> 05:02.440
I've got a bad feeling about him.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.920
Example 2.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.400
It's so dark.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.800
We shouldn't be out here.

05:08.800 --> 05:14.480
I've got a bad feeling about this.

05:14.480 --> 05:19.480
Example 3.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.320
I've got a bad feeling about this trip.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.640
I feel like something's going to happen.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.080
Maybe we shouldn't go.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.760
Okay.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.880
So basically you think something bad is going to happen.

05:32.880 --> 05:33.880
Yeah.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.920
You have a sort of uncomfortable feeling.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.920
Okay.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.920
That makes sense.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.240
I have a bad feeling about something.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.240
Exactly.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.240
Okay.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.400
Let's look at our second word now.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.400
Kicked me out.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.400
Kicked me out.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.400
Kicked me out.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.880
Kicked me out.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.000
So when someone kicks you out, it's they force you to leave.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.840
You don't want to leave, but they force you to.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.840
Yeah.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.360
Marco, have you ever kicked someone out of your class?

05:56.360 --> 05:57.360
Yes.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.360
I have.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.360
Really?

05:59.360 --> 06:00.360
Yeah.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
If you misbehave in my class, you're kicked out.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.760
So you're pretty strict.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.040
Sometimes I am.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.040
Okay.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.440
Also, maybe you've kicked your husband out of bed.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.240
I might have done that once or twice more.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.240
We'll have to ask him.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.240
I'm sure he has.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.240
All right.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.240
So that's what it means.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.680
You force someone to leave the house, leave the class, leave the bed.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.080
So kicked out of class, kicked out of the house, kicked out of bed.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
Exactly.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.080
Great.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.480
Let's look at our third word now.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.880
Kripped me out.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.480
Kripped me out.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.480
Kripped me out.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.280
Kripped me out.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.320
Now this is a really common phrase.

06:34.320 --> 06:38.600
I like this phrase a lot, and we've got some examples for you to listen to to help you

06:38.600 --> 06:42.560
understand this word a little bit better.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.560
Example 1.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.560
Shhh.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.560
Did you hear that?

06:48.560 --> 06:49.560
Oh.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.560
I think I saw something.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.560
Stop it.

06:54.560 --> 07:00.800
You're really creepy me out.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.560
Cool too.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.000
This place really creeps me out.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.200
Let's get out of here.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.200
All right.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.840
Well I have a confession to make.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.560
I'm kind of creeped out by clowns.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.560
You are.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.560
I don't know.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.560
They're just creepy.

07:18.560 --> 07:19.560
They scare me.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.560
Really?

07:20.560 --> 07:21.560
Yes.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.160
What is it about clowns that scare you so much?

07:23.160 --> 07:24.160
I don't know.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.040
They're just white faces and weird paint.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.040
I don't know.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.040
It's just creepy.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.040
And the way they laugh.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.520
Maybe at a bad experience with clowns as a child.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.520
Probably.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.520
I watched a scary movie about clowns or something.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.520
Yeah.

07:36.520 --> 07:37.520
All right.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.520
So creeped me out.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.320
Basically means made me feel uncomfortable.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.320
Yes.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
It scares you.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.320
Yeah.

07:43.320 --> 07:49.160
Well speaking of being scared, we have our final word for language takeaway.

07:49.160 --> 07:52.080
And it is scared the heck out of me.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.400
You scared the heck out of me.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.480
Scared the heck out of me.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.480
You got really scared.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.480
Yeah.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.320
I think this is a quite common way of saying, you really, really scared me.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
Yeah.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
OK.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.320
We're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

08:04.320 --> 08:09.560
Now, try and see if you can catch all these phrases that we just talked about.

08:09.560 --> 08:19.760
Oh, I don't know if you've heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.760
Yeah.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.760
I know.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.920
I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.080
His name is Armand.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
Really?

08:29.080 --> 08:31.080
What's he like?

08:31.080 --> 08:33.240
You have to fill me in.

08:33.240 --> 08:36.720
Actually, he's a bit strange.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.040
I don't know.

08:38.040 --> 08:41.080
I've just got a bad feeling about him.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.080
Really?

08:42.080 --> 08:43.080
Why?

08:43.080 --> 08:51.840
Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.320
And then he practically kicked me out.

08:55.320 --> 09:01.880
I tried to sort of peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't

09:01.880 --> 09:04.080
really get a good look.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.440
The whole thing really creeped me out.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.480
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

09:11.480 --> 09:20.000
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.120
It almost looked like a coffin.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.120
You see?

09:24.120 --> 09:25.120
Why would he...

09:25.120 --> 09:26.120
Hello, ladies.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.120
Ah!

09:27.120 --> 09:28.120
Armand!

09:28.120 --> 09:32.360
You scared the heck out of me.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.080
This is my friend Doris.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.240
A pleasure to meet you.

09:38.240 --> 09:43.680
If you are not doing anything tonight, I would like to have you both for dinner.

09:43.680 --> 09:54.680
I mean, I would like to have you both over for dinner.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.560
You know, one of the things I really like about this dialogue is there's a lot of great

09:58.560 --> 10:02.080
phrases that will help you to gossip.

10:02.080 --> 10:08.120
That's a good observation, so I think it's time for Fluency Builder.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.600
Fluency Builder

10:09.600 --> 10:14.040
In Fluency Builder, we take a simple phrase or a simple word you already know and show

10:14.040 --> 10:18.560
you how to express the same idea a little bit more naturally.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.560
Okay, great.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.800
So let's take a look at our first item for Fluency Builder.

10:22.800 --> 10:28.120
So when you gossip with somebody, you often tell them news or information that they don't

10:28.120 --> 10:29.720
know already.

10:29.720 --> 10:33.520
And you might start by saying, did you know that?

10:33.520 --> 10:35.600
Or you can say, did you hear?

10:35.600 --> 10:40.640
Yeah, both of those phrases are perfectly fine, but if you want to sound a little bit more

10:40.640 --> 10:46.680
native like when you're gossiping, you might try out this phrase from the dialogue.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.720
I don't know if you've heard.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.720
I don't know if you've heard.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.080
Yeah, that's a really good phrase.

10:54.080 --> 10:57.880
You're saying exactly the same thing, but in a really natural way.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.360
It's a great one for gossiping.

10:59.360 --> 11:04.920
So Marco, I don't know if you've heard, but Chinese pod is up to some pretty crazy things.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.680
See, that's exactly how you would use that phrase.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.760
So now let's take a look at our second item.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.440
Now when you're gossiping, you want information.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
That's right.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.160
So you might say, oh, tell me about it.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.760
Or something like, give me the details.

11:20.160 --> 11:24.880
Yeah, and again, both of these examples are perfectly fine, but when you're gossiping,

11:24.880 --> 11:28.400
you might want to try something like this.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.240
You have to fill me in.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.840
You have to fill me in.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.840
Fill me in.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.040
Yeah, that's what I would say.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.040
Fill me in.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
You know, give me the details.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.040
Fill me in.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.040
Fill me in on today's gossip.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.320
Okay, so let's take a look at our third item.

11:44.320 --> 11:49.720
Now, if you have some juicy gossipy news and you want to start up a conversation, you

11:49.760 --> 11:54.280
might use this phrase here.

11:54.280 --> 12:00.080
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

12:00.080 --> 12:05.520
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.720
That's a really good phrase.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.040
You can change it a little bit.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.160
You can say, you'll never guess who I saw.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.360
Or you'll never guess what I heard.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.360
Exactly.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.680
Very excellent gossip phrase.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.480
We're teaching you how to gossip because that's real English.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.480
People really do it.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.200
So you got another language for it.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.400
All right, so enough of our gossip.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.360
I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue one last time.

12:28.360 --> 12:37.880
Oh, I don't know if you've heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.200
Yeah, I know.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.200
I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.200
His name is Armand.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.200
Really?

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
What's he like?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.200
You have to fill me in.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.160
Actually, he's a bit strange.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.160
I don't know.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.240
I've just got a bad feeling about him.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.240
Really?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.240
Why?

12:54.240 --> 12:59.240
Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird

12:59.240 --> 13:01.960
and then he practically kicked me out.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.080
I tried to sort of peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't

13:06.080 --> 13:07.400
really get a good look.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.120
The whole thing really creeped me out.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.360
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

13:11.360 --> 13:16.480
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.280
It almost looked like a coffin.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.280
You see?

13:20.280 --> 13:21.280
Why could he?

13:21.280 --> 13:22.280
Oh, ladies.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.280
Armand!

13:23.280 --> 13:25.440
Oh, you scared the heck out of me.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.960
This is my friend Doris.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.920
I'm pleasure to meet you.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.520
If you're not doing anything tonight, I'd like to have you both for dinner.

13:32.520 --> 13:39.400
I mean, I'd like to have you both over for dinner.

13:39.400 --> 13:49.000
Okay, Marko, I have a true story for you.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.680
Is it kind of like a creepy story?

13:50.680 --> 13:53.160
It is a creepy story indeed.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.160
Is it a true story?

13:54.160 --> 13:55.160
No, it's really true.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.640
So when I was young, I used to live in the country.

13:58.640 --> 14:02.400
And you know, in the country, all of the neighbors know each other.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.800
It's a small community, so everyone knows what's happening all the time.

14:05.800 --> 14:06.800
Okay.

14:06.800 --> 14:12.680
And there was some gossip going on in our community about a guy who lived at the end

14:12.680 --> 14:14.160
of the road.

14:14.160 --> 14:18.520
And he was the owner of a car wrecking yard.

14:18.520 --> 14:23.760
So a place where you take old, broken down cars and take the parts apart to sell.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.760
Right.

14:24.760 --> 14:25.760
And anyway, a scrap yard.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.760
Yeah, a scrap yard.

14:26.760 --> 14:27.760
All right.

14:27.760 --> 14:33.000
Okay, so, you know, he had a wife and a couple of kids and suddenly his wife disappeared.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Wow.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.080
And no one knew what happened or anything.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.840
And so several years passed and suddenly the police start coming in and start investigating

14:42.840 --> 14:47.200
this guy and started digging up all of the land around his property.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.920
And I guess I don't know what they're doing, but I think they were looking for the wife's

14:50.920 --> 14:51.920
body.

14:51.920 --> 14:52.920
Wow.

14:52.920 --> 14:53.920
And did they find it?

14:53.920 --> 14:54.920
I don't know.

14:54.920 --> 14:55.920
I moved away.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.920
Oh, such a great story, but we don't know how it ends.

14:58.920 --> 14:59.920
Yeah.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.800
Well, we can leave it up to the imagination of our listeners.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.800
Exactly.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.480
And we're looking for an old car and a car buried in the ground.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.760
I don't think so.

15:08.760 --> 15:09.760
All right.

15:09.760 --> 15:13.000
That's a true story, real English, real stories, there you go.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
You heard it first here on English Pod.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
All right.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.880

15:19.880 --> 15:25.320
I bet a lot of our listeners also have creepy stories, maybe ghost stories, maybe, I

15:25.320 --> 15:28.280
don't know, different types of a weird story.

15:28.280 --> 15:32.480
So you guys should definitely log on to English Pod and share them with us.
