Hello English learners, welcome back to English pod. My name is Maruko.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
And today we're going to be talking about a really common situation with parents.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Yeah, when you're a teenager, you always need to ask your parents for money.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Ask your parents for the car or ask your parents if you can do something.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Exactly, and that's what we're going to be looking at is how you can ask for permission for the car for money.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Right, and these phrases are not only for your parents, right?

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
No, you could use them in your office with your boss or for any situation where you need to ask politely.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Okay, so let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
The vocabulary preview.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
We have one word for you today.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Concerts.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Concerts.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Concerts.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Concerts.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
A concert is an event, right?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Where people play music.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Right.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
So you have different types of concerts like a rock concert.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
They play rock music or a pop concert.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, a pop music or even a classical music concert.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Exactly where you have people playing violins and piano.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Okay, concert.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
So concerts are always for music.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, exactly. They're always for music.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Well, with that, let's go into our dialogue.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Marco, what happens here?

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Well, basically we have a teenage girl who needs to go to a concert

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
and is asking her dad for something.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Alright, let's listen.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Hey, Daddy.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
You look great today.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
I like your tie.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
By the way, I was wondering, can I?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
No.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Haven't even told you what it is yet.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Okay, okay, what do you want?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Do you think I could borrow the car?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm going to a concert tonight.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Um, I don't think so.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I need the car tonight to pick up your mother.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Ugh.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I told you about it last week.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Smelly toes is playing.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
And Eric asked if I would go with him.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Who is this Eric guy?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
duh.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Come on, Dad.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Please.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
No can do.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Sorry.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Fine, then.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
No way.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Ugh, that's so unfair.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Teenagers, huh?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
They're always asking for something.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, this brings back memories, but I'll tell you about that later.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Uh, why don't we take a look at the vocabulary and language takeaway?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Language takeaway.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
All right, we've got a few interesting words here.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Um, the first one.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Hotest.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Hotest.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Hotest.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
So this is the superlative of hot.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Right.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
So the hottest guy in school is...

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
The most handsome.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, the most sexy guy in school.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Exactly.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
So if somebody is hot, they are really attractive.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Really good looking.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Really good looking.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Um, and so Marko, is this a word that is only used for men?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
No, it's you can also use it for women.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Um, and what about things?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
You know, recently with Paris Hilton.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
It's more popular with things like...

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Wow, I got a new cart. Wow, that's hot.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Right.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
But I guess we maybe should tell our listeners to be careful with this word.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, you don't really want to tell somebody your hot.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
No.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
You're not very polite.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
But with your friends, you can use this word.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Exactly.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
If I'm talking with my friends and I see a girl like, wow, she's hot.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Okay.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
But just don't tell her.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, don't go up to her and say, wow, your hot.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Okay.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Our next word, most popular.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Most popular.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Most popular.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Most popular.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Another superlative.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Exactly.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
And popular means...

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Means having a lot of friends.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Exactly. Having a lot of friends or being well-known.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Or well-liked.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Well-liked.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
So in every school there's always like the most popular guy in school,

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
the most popular girl.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yep.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Were you the most popular guy?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Um, not really.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
No, I wasn't the most popular guy, but I wasn't unpopular.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Okay.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
So that's the opposite.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
So I was okay.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
All right. Our last phrase.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Find then.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Find then.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Find then.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
The world is a phrase made up of two simple words,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
but why don't we listen to some examples so we can understand the meaning of these two words together.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Example one.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Find then.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
If you want to go with me, I'll go by myself.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Example two.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Find then. If you want to break up, I don't care.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Example three.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
You want to go out with your friends?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Find then. Go!

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
So you would use this when you agree with somebody, but you're not really happy about it.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah. It's like saying, I agree, but I'm really angry.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Right. Maybe sometimes because you don't have a choice, right? Like the girl.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Find then.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah. Yeah.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
So even though we have the word fine in there, it's not really a nice thing to say to someone.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
No, no, this is definitely not one to use with your boss.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Right. Exactly. Okay.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Okay. Let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll talk about some more phrases.

05:37.000 --> 05:46.000
Hey, Daddy, you look great today. I like your tie.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
By the way, I was wondering, can I?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
No.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Okay. Okay. What do you want?

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
Do you think I could borrow the car? I'm going to a concert tonight.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
I don't think so. I need the car tonight to pick up your mother.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Ugh.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
I told you about it last week.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
Smelly toes is playing, and Eric asked if I would go with him.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Who is this Eric guy?

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
duh. He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Come on, Dad. Please.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
No can do. Sorry.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Fine then. Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
No way.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
That's so unfair.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
There's a lot of phrases in this dialogue that we can use to ask for something, right?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Exactly. And in a very polite way.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
Okay. So we're going to look at three ways of asking for something.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
And the first way is I was wondering.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I was wondering. I was wondering.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
So I could say, I was wondering, can I borrow your car?

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah. Or I was wondering. Can I stay at your house?

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Okay. It's a very nice way to ask something.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah. It's like to begin a question.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
To begin. Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
All right. Let's take a look at the next one.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
And it's basically the same thing.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Do you think I could?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Do you think I could?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Do you think I could?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Do you think I could?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Or do you think I could use your computer?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I can say I was wondering. Can I use your computer?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Do you think I could use your computer?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah. Let me in the same.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Right.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Now let's look at the last one.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Would you mind?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Would you mind?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Would you mind?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Would you mind?

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
So I could say, would you mind holding this for me?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yep.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Or would you mind finishing this report for me?

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Now there's an interesting thing here that you have the verb

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
in a gerend form, right?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Right. The ING form.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Exactly.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Giving, holding, finishing.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
So we've got, I was wondering, can I do something?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Right.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And would you mind doing something?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
So you have the ING.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Mm-hmm.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Be very, very careful.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Be sure to not say, would you mind to give me?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Right.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
That's wrong.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
That's wrong.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So you would say, would you mind giving me?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yep.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Okay.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Let's listen to some more examples of these three phrases.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Example one.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Would you mind cooking dinner tonight?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I'll be home late.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Example two.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
We were wondering if you could buy the tickets for us?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Example three.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Do you think you can have those reports finished by today?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
All right. So I think it's really clear now.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And it's a very useful way of asking for things.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Okay. So let's listen to our dialogue for the third time.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Hey Daddy.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
You look great today.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I like your tie.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
By the way, I was wondering, can I?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
No.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Haven't even told you what it is yet.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Okay.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Okay. What do you want?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Do you think I could borrow the car?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm going to a concert tonight.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Um, I don't think so.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I need the car tonight to pick up your mother.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Ugh.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I told you about it last week.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Smelly tells his playing.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
And Eric asked if I would go with him.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Who is this Eric guy?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Stop.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Come on, Dad.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Please.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
No can do.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Sorry.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Fine then.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
No way.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Ugh.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
That's so unfair.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
So Marco, you said that this dialogue really brought back some memories for you.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
My dad was exactly the same way.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I would just say Dad and he would be like, no.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Wow.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
So he would always cut me off before I ask anything.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Uh, sounds like a pretty strict guy.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
No, but it was a lot of fun.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Sometimes he would just say it just to make me angry or something like that.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah, exactly.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
But it was difficult to get him to lend me the car, for example.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Really?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Oh, yeah.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I mean, he wouldn't just lend me the car.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
And sometimes if he did lend me the car, then the next day,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
he would be like, hey, you need to wash the car or something like that.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
So there's, so you had to pay him back.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I had to pay him back with something.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
In my family, I was always allowed to borrow the car because we lived really really far away from the city.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
So there were no buses or subway.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
Um, I always got to borrow the worst car, you know, the most terrible car.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Really?

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
Um, which led to so many problems, like, my car stopping working in the middle of the street was never good.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
We did used to live a little bit further away from downtown, but we had a good bus system.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Yep.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
So he'd just be like, take the bus as cheaper and stuff like that.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
So, so I didn't really get the car that often until I bought my own or, or until I had a motorcycle with my own and then,

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
problem solved.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
Alright, well, I want to know from our listeners, um, what did they ask for from their parent?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Exactly.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Did you ask for the car?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Did you ask for money?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Or did you ask for a pony?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Did you ask for a pony?

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
I had a friend who had a summer home.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Really?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
So he would ask for the keys to the summer home.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Okay.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
