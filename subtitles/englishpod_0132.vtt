00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to the English pod, my name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.400
And my name is Katherine, and today we're talking about being on the road.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.400
Yeah, we're going to be on the road, but we're going to encounter a little bit of a car problems.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.400
My favorite kind.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.400
I think it's happened to everyone, you're on the road, or maybe you're coming back from work.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.000
You get a flat tie or something happens to your car, right?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
And it's always when you're in a rush.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.800
And most of the time it's raining.

00:27.800 --> 00:28.800
Yeah.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.800
Or just annoying.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.600
So all of the circumstances definitely, well, they don't help.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.600
Let's just say.

00:34.600 --> 00:35.600
All right.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.800
So before we listen to this dialogue, let's take a look at some of the words in today's

00:38.800 --> 00:40.600
vocabulary preview.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.800
Very vocabulary preview.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.800
All right.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.800
So we're going to take a look at two words.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.800
They're kind of strange.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.800
I don't know, kind of difficult to understand.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.800
So that's what we're going to explain them.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.800
The first one is spew to spew.

00:54.800 --> 00:55.800
It's a verb, okay?

00:55.800 --> 00:56.800
To spew.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.800
What can spew?

00:58.800 --> 00:59.800
Volcano can spew?

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
Exactly.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
An engine can spew?

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
A person can spew?

01:02.800 --> 01:04.800
Yeah, that's not very nice.

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
No.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.800
So basically, it's to like, expel or to shoot out.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.800
Shoot out from your mouth or something.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
Liquid.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.800
So in the case of a person, right?

01:14.800 --> 01:17.800
So if a person spews, it means a person throws up.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
But it's usually very forceful.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.800
All right.

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
It's very messy.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.800
A volcano can spew lava.

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
Exactly.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.800
So a volcano is spewing lava.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.800
Now for the next word that we have,

01:28.800 --> 01:32.800
it's a informal way of saying that something is broken.

01:32.800 --> 01:33.800
Because it's busted.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.800
It's busted.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.800
My DVD player is busted.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.800
Man, my phone is busted.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
So it's an informal way.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.800
Very popular, very common.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.800
I would say to describe that something is not working.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.800
I don't think many people actually say,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.800
well, it's broken or it's damaged.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.800
Yeah, they're pretty much mixed, I think.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.800
But you will definitely hear busted if you're talking to native English people.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.800
Or even, like, for example, your arm.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.800
Oh, he's got a busted arm.

01:58.800 --> 01:59.800
Exactly.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.800
So busted.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.800
All right.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.800
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.800
Let's see what's going on with this car trouble.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.800
And then we'll come back and explain something.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.800
Howdy.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.800
Nice car.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.800
What seems to be the problem?

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
I don't know.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.800
The stupid old car started being white smoke and it just died on me.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.800
Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here.

02:31.800 --> 02:32.800
What do you think it is?

02:32.800 --> 02:33.800
Not sure yet.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.800
How about you pop the hood and we can take a look?

02:41.800 --> 02:42.800
Doesn't look good.

02:42.800 --> 02:43.800
What do you mean?

02:43.800 --> 02:46.800
My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.800
It's brand new.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.800
Well, Missy, the white smoke that you saw as steam from the radiator.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
You overheated your engine.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.800
So now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

02:56.800 --> 03:01.800
You should have called us and we could have told you over here when you car died.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.800
So how long is this going to take an hour?

03:05.800 --> 03:07.800
I'm afraid a bit more than that.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.800
We need to order the spare parts.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.800
Take a part of your electrical system.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.800
Fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.800
You were going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.800
What?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.800
How am I supposed to go to school or go shopping?

03:22.800 --> 03:25.800
This is not happening.

03:29.800 --> 03:35.800
So if I were the mechanic, I would not be very happy to be dealing with someone like this girl.

03:35.800 --> 03:40.800
I think it's, well, maybe it's a little bit stereotypical that we put it as a as a girl.

03:40.800 --> 03:45.800
Because guys and girls, so many people don't know anything about cars or mechanics.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.800
And in the States, there's a lot of female mechanics too, so it's mixed.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.800
But definitely it's something that happens all the time.

03:52.800 --> 03:57.800
And probably the mechanic will overcharge her as well because apparently she doesn't know what she's doing.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.800
And that's one of the reasons we want to give you the vocabulary to deal with these situations.

04:00.800 --> 04:05.800
So let's look at some of those car words in today's language takeaway.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.800
Language takeaway.

04:08.800 --> 04:14.800
Alright, so we're going to take a look at very specific words related to cars and the engines and everything.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.800
So let's start with the first one.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.800
Radiator.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.800
Radiator.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.800
Alright, so the radiator of the car.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.800
So radiator is something that you normally find in the front of the car near the engine.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.800
It usually gets very, very hot, right?

04:28.800 --> 04:29.800
Yeah.

04:29.800 --> 04:34.800
So one of the big issues is radiators getting too hot because there's no way to cool them down.

04:34.800 --> 04:40.800
So if you live in a place that's very hot, the radiator keeps your engine cool because it has water in it.

04:40.800 --> 04:46.800
So if it overheats or maybe you didn't put enough water in there and it'll start spewing steam like in this dialogue.

04:46.800 --> 04:52.800
And if you have a problem with your radiator, you could actually do a lot of damage to your engine, which is why this is important.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.800
Exactly.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.800
And that's what happened in this dialogue.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.800
So a radiator.

04:56.800 --> 05:02.800
Now because the radiator wasn't working well, it overheated the engine and he said they had some busted pistons.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.800
So broken pistons.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.800
Pistons are important because they're kind of like valves that go up and down.

05:08.800 --> 05:09.800
Right.

05:09.800 --> 05:15.800
So inside your engine, you have many explosions and the pistons move up and down and that's what actually moves your car.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.800
Right.

05:16.800 --> 05:22.800
And so pistons, in general, are things in mechanics, so like a trumpet has pistons, things that go up and down,

05:22.800 --> 05:27.800
and that allow for the flow of air or something like that.

05:27.800 --> 05:28.800
Very good.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.800
So that's a piston.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.800
And well, another very common mechanic term is the transmission.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.800
All right.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.800
So the transmission, what happens if your transmission dies?

05:37.800 --> 05:38.800
Can you still drive?

05:38.800 --> 05:42.800
You basically can't move or maybe you only have one gear or two gears.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.800
All right.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.800
So think about transmission as coming from the word to transmit.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.800
That means to transfer.

05:47.800 --> 05:54.800
So this is the part of the car that transfers energy or the power to actually move the car.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.800
So the transmission.

05:56.800 --> 06:01.800
And we've got the mechanic who says, well, we've got to order you some spare parts.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.800
So first, let's look at the word spare.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.800
What's another word for spare?

06:05.800 --> 06:07.800
Additional, maybe extra.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.800
Extra.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.800
Right.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.800
So spare means extra.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.800
Parts are, well, pieces.

06:12.800 --> 06:18.800
So we're talking about ordering a new transmission, new pistons, things to replace the broken things.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.800
spare parts.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.800
So this is where you go to the mechanic to get some spare parts and get them installed.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.800
You probably don't have many spare parts at home, right?

06:26.800 --> 06:28.800
You got a transmission lying around.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.800
Oh, yeah.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.800
So spare parts.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.800
And the last word that we're going to take a look at is a fuel pump.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.800
Okay.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.800
So a pump is, you could have a bike pump.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.800
A water pump, water pumps.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.800
So these are something that we use very, very often.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.800
But a fuel pump is something that allows gas gasoline to get into your engine.

06:48.800 --> 06:53.800
So it's basically a device that pushes gasoline into the engine.

06:53.800 --> 06:54.800
So you can start.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.800
And that's the same thing with the water pump.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
It's a device that pushes water.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.800
Or an air pump is something that pushes air into your tires and your bicycle.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.800
Exactly.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.800
So a fuel pump, water pump, etc.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
Wow.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.800
I feel like we know a lot about cars.

07:07.800 --> 07:08.800
Yeah.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.800
Apparently we do, see?

07:09.800 --> 07:10.800
All right.

07:10.800 --> 07:16.800
So now that we've taken a look at all of these great words, let's move on to a couple of phrases

07:16.800 --> 07:18.800
in fluency builder.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.800
Fluency builder.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.800
All right.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.800
These are phrases that you hear sometimes when you're talking about electronics.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.800
But in today's lesson, we're all talking about specific car phrases.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.800
You're going to hear these all the time with mechanics.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.800
Right.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.800
And the first one is the car suddenly died on me.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
All right.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.800
To die on.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.800
So we keep these two words together.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.800
Die on.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.800
Mm-hmm.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.800
Oh, man.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.800
So while you were driving, your car died.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.800
It stopped moving.

07:44.800 --> 07:45.800
Mm-hmm.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.800
So that means that it doesn't work anymore.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
And it's not only for cars, right?

07:50.800 --> 07:53.800
You can say my MP3 player died on me today.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
Exactly.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.800
And what it means is it's not like you left it and you forgot about it and you tried it again

07:58.800 --> 07:59.800
that didn't work.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.800
It means while you're using it, it dies.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.800
Exactly.

08:02.800 --> 08:03.800
Mm-hmm.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.800
So I think this phrase is a good one to give some other examples.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
So let's listen.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.800
Example one.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.800
My CD player died on me.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.800
And I had to listen to the radio.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.800
Example two.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.800
Get that medicine over here fast.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.800
Or this guy is going to die on me.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.800
Example three.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.800
I forgot to charge my mobile phone.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.800
It's going to die on me soon.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.800
So this next one is a phrase you hear.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.800
The first thing you hear may be when you tell someone you have a car problem.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.800
Right.

08:39.800 --> 08:40.800
You tell them to pop the hood.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.800
Or let's pop the hood.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.800
Mm-hmm.

08:43.800 --> 08:45.800
So this means let's open the front part of the car.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.800
The hood to look at the engine, transmission, all those parts.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.800
Exactly.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.800
So you can say open the hood.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.800
But the most common one is pop the hood.

08:55.800 --> 09:00.800
So the reason is because there is a little spring and you have to pull inside the car and

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
goes pop.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.800
And there's a little, there's a little jump.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
Yeah, exactly.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.800
So it's literally popping.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.800
Right.

09:07.800 --> 09:08.800
Or you can also say the trunk, right?

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
The back part of the car.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.800
Hey, can you pop the trunk for me?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.800
I've got to put some stuff inside.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.800
Exactly.

09:13.800 --> 09:14.800
So pop the hood, pop the trunk.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.800
And next we've got this, this girl actually who's talking about her car because she just

09:19.800 --> 09:20.800
got this car.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.800
So it's another way to say it's a new car.

09:23.800 --> 09:24.800
It's brand new.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.800
Is that more new than new?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.800
It's like newer newer than you.

09:28.800 --> 09:32.800
All right, so brand, you think about brands like Ford or Goochie.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.800
These are brands, but brand new means.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.800
She maybe got it like today.

09:37.800 --> 09:38.800
Mm-hmm.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.800
So it's brand new.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
It's very, very new.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.800
Did you see my brand new watch?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.800
Wow, it is nice for you to get it.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.800
All right, so brand new.

09:46.800 --> 09:51.800
And well, the last phrase that we have for you today is to take a part something.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.800
All right, so this is very popular with young children.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.800
Like they like to take things apart so they can find out how they work.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.800
But to take a more it means to take all the pieces and to pull them out.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.800
Mm-hmm.

10:01.800 --> 10:02.800
Yeah, I used to do that a lot when I was a kid.

10:02.800 --> 10:07.800
I used to take a part any electronic device to kind of see how it works.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.800
And then I would try to put it back together again.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.800
And that's why you're so smart.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.800
It never really worked.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.800
It worked half the time.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.800
So the problem is always putting them back together again.

10:16.800 --> 10:17.800
Exactly.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.800
So you can take it apart, but then you put it back together.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.800
And there's always a screw missing or a screw that's extra or two or three parts.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.800
Not a good sign.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.800
All right, so we're taking a look at a lot of great words and phrases.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.800
So let's listen to this dialogue for the last time.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.800
Howdy.

10:44.800 --> 10:45.800
Nice card.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.800
What seems to be the problem?

10:47.800 --> 10:48.800
I don't know.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.800
The stupid old car started being white smoke and it just died on me.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.800
Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.800
What do you think it is?

10:57.800 --> 10:58.800
Not sure yet.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.800
How about you pop the hood and we can take a look?

11:04.800 --> 11:05.800
Mm.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.800
Doesn't look good.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
What do you mean?

11:08.800 --> 11:10.800
My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.800
It's brand new.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.800
Well, Missy.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.800
The white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.800
You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.800
You should have called us and we could have told you over here when you car died.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.800
Ugh.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.800
So how long is this going to take an hour?

11:29.800 --> 11:31.800
I'm afraid a bit more than that.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.800
We need to order the spare parts.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.800
Take a part of your electrical system.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.800
Fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.800
You're going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.

11:42.800 --> 11:43.800
What?

11:43.800 --> 11:45.800
How am I supposed to go to school?

11:45.800 --> 11:46.800
Or go shopping?

11:46.800 --> 11:49.800
This is not happening.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.800
All right, so car travel.

11:57.800 --> 12:02.800
Have you ever had like any very serious car travel or like something weird happened to your car?

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
Actually.

12:03.800 --> 12:07.800
The week before I decided to leave Chicago,

12:07.800 --> 12:11.800
I had this 1991 Honda Civic patchback.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.800
So only two doors.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
Nice.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.800
And I was driving home from work.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
I was on the highway.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.800
I had the radio on the windows open.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.800
And then it died.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.800
It died in the middle of the highway during rush hour.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.800
Right?

12:24.800 --> 12:25.800
So that's when there's tons of cars.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.800
And I didn't know what to do.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.800
Some calling people and then all the sudden I see someone tapping on my window.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.800
And there's cars everywhere.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.800
And it's this guy.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.800
And he's like, listen, do you need a hand?

12:36.800 --> 12:37.800
I said, yes.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.800
So I put the car in neutral so that there's no break.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.800
And he pushed it to a side road and gave me a ride home.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.800
No way.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.800
It was the coolest guy who's so nice.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.800
And he was just there with his truck.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.800
He's a gardener and just gave me a ride home.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.800
It was super, super cool.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.800
Wow.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.800
And so it turns out my engine dot.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.800
No, the engine was new.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.800
It was a transmission.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.800
It was shot.

13:00.800 --> 13:01.800
It was totally broken.

13:01.800 --> 13:02.800
Wow.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
But I was very lucky to have such a kind person.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.800
Yeah, that's a good story because usually people are too afraid.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.800
Or maybe a little bit reluctant to stop and see if you're okay.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.800
Or if you need a ride or something.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.800
Because you know, you can't really trust people these days.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.800
So, but it's good.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.800
I once I saw somebody on the side of the road and had a flat tire.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.800
It was two girls and they didn't know what to do.

13:23.800 --> 13:24.800
So I was like passing by.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.800
It was actually raining.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.800
And I was like, hey, do you guys need a hand?

13:28.800 --> 13:29.800
And then like, yeah, please.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.800
We can't, we can't locate my dad or whatever.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.800
So I was like, changing the tire.

13:34.800 --> 13:35.800
It's not a big deal, right?

13:35.800 --> 13:36.800
Right.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.800
And they wanted to tip me.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
They wanted to give me something.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.800
Isn't it like, oh, please say that it's just so kind.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.800
You're time and you're all wet.

13:41.800 --> 13:42.800
And I'm like, no, no.

13:42.800 --> 13:43.800
What are you about it?

13:43.800 --> 13:44.800
No, it's just a nice thing to do.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
If you know anything about cars.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.800
Yeah.

13:47.800 --> 13:48.800
Or if you can offer someone a lift.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.800
I know it's not terribly safe to ride with strangers.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.800
But the sky totally helped me out.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.800
So nice.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.800
All right.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.800
Well, maybe you guys have some cool or maybe some interesting stories of what's happened with your

13:59.800 --> 14:01.800
cars or maybe you've helped somebody out.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.800
