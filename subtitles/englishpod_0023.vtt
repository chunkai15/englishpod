00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
Hello English learners. Welcome to another great lesson with EnglishPod. My name is Margo.

00:06.960 --> 00:13.440
And I'm Erica. So Erica, how are you today? I'm doing pretty well. And I think we've got a good lesson today.

00:13.440 --> 00:20.240
A really helpful lesson. What are we talking about today? We have an elementary lesson about making an appointment.

00:20.240 --> 00:26.400
All right, making an appointment. Yeah, that's really helpful. I guess you have to make appointments for the doctor or

00:26.480 --> 00:33.520
at work, maybe or with your friends. Yeah. So this is language that you can use every day to make appointments.

00:33.520 --> 00:38.320
Great. Well, so why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview.

00:39.120 --> 00:47.120
The vocabulary preview. We only have one word today, which you need to know to understand this dialogue.

00:47.120 --> 00:56.240
And it is financial advisor. Financial advisor. Financial advisor. So what is a financial

00:57.040 --> 01:06.000
a financial advisor is a person who gives suggestions or recommendations about investing money.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.400
Someone who wants you to put money in the stock markets. Okay, great. I guess we're ready now to listen to

01:12.400 --> 01:18.160
our dialogue for the first time. And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, but you don't have to worry about it.

01:18.160 --> 01:21.920
Because we'll come back and teach you all the important words.

01:27.040 --> 01:36.000
Hello, favorite consulting. How may I help you? Yes, this is Julian Horton.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.040
And I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Ms. Melee.

01:39.040 --> 01:44.160
Certainly, what day were you thinking of? How was Thursday? Did she have any time available then?

01:44.160 --> 01:50.320
Um, let me double check. Unfortunately, she's booked solid on Thursday. How does next Monday work for you?

01:50.320 --> 01:53.840
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday. Can she do a Tuesday?

01:54.480 --> 01:59.280
Sure, Tuesday's perfect. May I ask where you're calling from? Sure.

01:59.280 --> 02:04.880
That's in financial advisors. Oh, actually Tuesday's no good. Sorry about that.

02:10.160 --> 02:16.400
Well, I guess Ms. Melee does not want to speak to any financial advisors.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.880
Yeah, I guess she doesn't really want to invest in the stock market. Or maybe she just gets too many

02:20.880 --> 02:25.920
phone calls from them. Yeah. If you have money, I guess you'll get phone calls from people like that.

02:25.920 --> 02:32.400
I guess we don't have that problem. No, we don't. Okay, let's start with our language takeaway for today.

02:34.480 --> 02:44.720
Language takeaway. So, forward's today. The first one is available. Available. Available. Available.

02:44.720 --> 02:50.560
Meaning that you are not busy. That you're free. You're free. You're not busy. Exactly.

02:50.880 --> 02:58.880
Let's move to our next word. Double check. Double check. Double check. I think we've got some

02:58.880 --> 03:09.680
examples of this phrase. Example one. Do you have the tickets? I think so, but let me just double check.

03:09.760 --> 03:22.480
Example two. I thought I sent that email already, but let me double check.

03:26.240 --> 03:32.400
Okay, so double check basically means to check something twice. Exactly. To check it again. Check it again.

03:33.360 --> 03:41.200
Our third word for language takeaway today is scheduled. Scheduled. Scheduled. Scheduled.

03:41.200 --> 03:49.520
S-C-H-E-D-U-L-E-D. Scheduled. Scheduled. So, when you have something scheduled, it means that you have

03:49.520 --> 03:55.440
something planned. Plan, right? Yeah, or booked at that time. Booked at that time. Yeah, we've got a

03:55.440 --> 04:01.040
lunch schedule this afternoon. Don't wait. Yes, we do. All right. Great lunch. Looking forward to it.

04:01.120 --> 04:12.480
And our last word for today is booked solid. Booked solid. B-O-O-K-E-D. Booked solid.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.720
So, we have some great examples on how you can use this great phrase booked solid,

04:16.720 --> 04:25.200
and you can understand what it means. Example one. I can't get a hotel room.

04:25.280 --> 04:32.320
They're booked solid until after the new year. Example two.

04:35.280 --> 04:39.680
I'm sorry, there are no seats available in these flights. We booked solid over the Christmas holidays.

04:43.040 --> 04:51.200
Example three. Sorry, I can't meet with you today. I'm booked solid.

04:51.280 --> 05:00.800
Okay, great. So, booked solid basically is, you have no free time, no available time.

05:00.800 --> 05:07.200
Right. So, you've got appointments scheduled all day. All day great. So, with this in mind,

05:07.200 --> 05:12.400
now we can listen to our dialogue a second time. This time it's going to be slow so we can

05:12.400 --> 05:23.200
understand a little bit better. Hello, Fairbrook Consulting. How may I help you?

05:23.920 --> 05:30.560
Yes, this is Julian Horton, and I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Mismic Mealy.

05:31.360 --> 05:39.200
Certainly, what date were you thinking of? How's Thursday? Does she have any time available then?

05:40.000 --> 05:47.040
Um, let me double check. No. Unfortunately, she's booked solid on Thursday.

05:47.040 --> 05:53.360
How does next Monday work for you? Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday.

05:54.240 --> 06:01.040
Can she do Tuesday? Sure. Tuesday's perfect. May I ask where you're calling from?

06:01.680 --> 06:10.560
Sure. Matt and financial advisors. Oh, actually Tuesday's no good. Sorry about that.

06:14.160 --> 06:19.200
Okay, so now it's a little bit more clear and with this we can start with putting it together.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.640
Putting it together.

06:23.280 --> 06:29.600
There's some great examples in this dialogue of phrases you can use when you need

06:29.600 --> 06:34.800
to schedule an appointment and we're going to look at those today. In the dialogue we heard

06:34.800 --> 06:43.120
Julian ask about making an appointment and she said this. I'm calling to arrange an appointment

06:43.120 --> 06:50.080
with Mismic Mealy. I'm calling to arrange an appointment with Mismic Mealy.

06:50.960 --> 06:57.440
So this is a great way to schedule an appointment to ask for some time from somebody else.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.240
Yeah, and we have some more examples of this phrase.

07:01.440 --> 07:06.160
Example one, please book an appointment for next week.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.880
Example two, please schedule an appointment for next week.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.440
Great. So after that, when you're scheduling an appointment, you need to

07:18.080 --> 07:23.600
suggest a day when maybe that person has time. Yes, let's listen to what they said in the

07:23.600 --> 07:24.160
dialogue.

07:34.720 --> 07:40.240
You say, well, how's Thursday or how's Tuesday? And maybe that person doesn't have time that day,

07:40.240 --> 07:41.680
so they'll say something like this.

07:48.400 --> 07:54.400
Okay, Erica, so if I want to have a meeting with you, I would say how's Monday sound or how's

07:54.400 --> 08:02.800
Monday? Monday's no good. I'm busy all day. How's Tuesday? Sorry Tuesday's no good either.

08:03.360 --> 08:09.680
What about Wednesday? Okay, Wednesday works. All right, great. Wednesday's perfect. Okay, it's great.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.520
So we have a meeting on Wednesday. Okay, yeah, those are some great phrases. Hey,

08:13.520 --> 08:18.000
first scheduling an appointment. Yeah, they're really good. Okay, so now we can listen to our dialogue

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
a third time and we're ready to understand everything that we've just talked about.

08:31.920 --> 08:37.600
Hello, favorite consulting, how may I help you? Yes, this is Julian Horton and I'm

08:38.000 --> 08:42.240
going to arrange an appointment with Nathan at Melee. Certainly, what day were you thinking of?

08:42.240 --> 08:46.640
How's Thursday? Did she have any time available then? Let me double check.

08:47.760 --> 08:51.520
Unfortunately, she's booked solid on Thursday. How does next Monday work for you?

08:51.520 --> 08:56.640
Actually, I've got something scheduled on Monday. Can't you do a Tuesday? Sure, Tuesday's

08:56.640 --> 09:02.640
perfect. May I ask where you're calling from? Sure, that's in financial advisors. Oh,

09:03.600 --> 09:06.080
actually Tuesday's no good. Sorry about that.

09:13.120 --> 09:17.360
The language in this dialogue is really useful isn't it, Marco? Yeah, it's from an

09:17.360 --> 09:22.720
everyday situation. You always have to make appointments at some point. Yes, and like we said earlier,

09:22.720 --> 09:29.360
it's language you can use when you need to talk about work with your boss, maybe, or when you

09:29.360 --> 09:34.400
need to do daily things like go to the doctor or even when you're planning something with your friends.

09:34.400 --> 09:39.440
Right. Yeah, you can use this in all those in all situations. Uh-huh. Great. Well, we're at a

09:39.440 --> 09:44.160
time now, but I hope you enjoyed our lesson and found it useful. And if you have any questions or
