00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello English learners. Welcome back to English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
And today we're looking at some more romance.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
We're talking about dating.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Dating, exactly.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
And not only dating, but asking someone to become your boyfriend or girlfriend.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Yeah, that's true.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
And so we're going to be focusing on language to express your romantic feelings.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
And also maybe some phrases you can use to ask someone out.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Very good.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
So I'm sure you guys are excited about this one.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Hey, you're early. Where's everyone?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Well, I told them not to come.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Oh, why?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Sure, what is it?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Okay, here's the thing.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
And I can't take it anymore.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I know you better than anyone.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I think we would be great together, don't you?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Are you serious? We've been friends for years.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
We can't just change that overnight.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I know.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I never had the guts to tell you.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm still today.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
So what do you say?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Ah, ah.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
All right, I wonder is she going to say yes?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know. She seems a little bit confused.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Well, I guess it's always strange when your best friend

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
suddenly wants to be your boyfriend or girlfriend.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
It does happen though.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah, that does happen.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
So why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
that was used in this dialogue to express these feelings

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
and let's start with fluency builder.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Okay, so we're doing things a little differently today.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
We're looking at phrases and not just vocabulary words.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
So he used some wonderful phrases to ask her to be his boyfriend

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
and he started with this.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Here's the thing.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Here's the thing.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Here's the thing.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
All right, that's a very strange phrase.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Here's the thing.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Is he giving her something?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Not quite. He's not giving her an object,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
but he's giving her some information.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Okay, so it's a very common way to start an idea.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
That's right.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
You're about to tell the person the main problem with the main

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
the main piece of information.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Right, so you would start with, here's the thing

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
and then start explaining.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay, why don't we do an example.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
For example, you could say,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
all right, here's the thing.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
People don't like you.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
All right, well, I hope they don't say that to me.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
But another example, Marco, here's the thing.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
We're behind in our podcasting.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
We have to work over time.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Okay, so the main idea.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Yep, very good.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Moving on to our next phrase.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
He said,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I can't take it.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I can't take it anymore.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I can't take it anymore.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
So he can't take it anymore.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Take what?

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, why don't we find out by listening to some examples?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Example one.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
The man next door has been so loud.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I can't take it anymore.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Example two.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
My boss always yells at me.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
I can't take it anymore.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Example three.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I can't take it anymore.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm going to quit.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
All right, so basically,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
you can't stand it.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
You can't tolerate it anymore.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Exactly.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
This is a phrase we use when we are really frustrated.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
But yeah, when we're frustrated or when we just can't handle it anymore.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
And well, after he finished his declaration of love,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
she responded by saying,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Are you serious?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Are you serious?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Are you serious?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Are you serious?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Are you serious?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Okay, so what does she mean?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
She's just saying, really?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Exactly.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It's another way of saying, really?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So this is a phrase that's really,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
it's quite informal, isn't it?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't use it in a business context.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
No, and it's also something that's used mostly by younger people.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Right, if you say something that's amazing

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
or that's incredible or hard to believe,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
you might get this response.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Are you serious?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Right.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
So he is very serious,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
but he confessed that he never had the guts to tell her.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Hmm, have the guts.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I never had the guts to tell you.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I never had the guts.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
All right, so to have guts,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
that's to be brave, to be brave courageous.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yep.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
So we have some examples of how we would use guts in different situations.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
So let's listen.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Example one.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
I don't have the guts to go skydiving.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Example two.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I don't have the guts to give a speech.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Example three.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I've never had the guts to say no to my boss.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
All right, so to have the guts to do something,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
hey, but Marco, this word guts is an interesting one.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Yes, it is because guts can also mean your internal organs.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Like your stomach and your intestines and your lungs.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Exactly.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Those are your guts.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Yep.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
So when you have guts, you're really brave.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Exactly.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Your courageous.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Hmm.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
All right, very good.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the second time.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And we'll come back and look at some phrases and putting it together.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Hey, you're early.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Where's everyone?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Well, I told them not to come.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Oh, why?

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Sure.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
What is it?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Hmm.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Okay.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Here's the thing.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
And I can't take it anymore.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I know you better than anyone.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I think we would be great together.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Don't you?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Are you serious?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We've been friends for years.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
We can't just change that overnight.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I know.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
I've never had the guts to tell you until today.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
So, what do you say?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I...

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I...

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
All right.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
That's a little bit clearer this time.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
But while I was listening,

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
I noticed that there's some more great phrases that you can use together with different words.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
So let's look at those now.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I'm putting it together.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Putting it together.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
All right.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Let's take a look at the first one.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
He said,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
The two of us.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Just the two of us.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
So just the two of us.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Quite simply it means you and me just us, right?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Just us.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
So why is this phrase important?

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
I think it's a great way to show the idea of only us, right?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Right.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And we can use it together with any number we want.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So what about the four of us?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Just the four of us.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Just the eight of us.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Okay.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
So it suggests the idea of only us.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Okay.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So he made the reservation just for the two of us

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
because he thought they could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
All to ourselves.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
All to ourselves.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
All to ourselves.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
If you have something all to yourself or we have something all to ourselves.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
We have that thing all alone.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
We don't have to share it.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
We don't share very good.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
So I guess you can say my parents are out of town.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
So I have the apartment or I have the house all to myself.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Or even she wants to eat the cake all to herself.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Very good.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
So that's a very good phrase.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And you can use it with any pronoun.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
Well, so the guy is explaining that I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I've always seen you as.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I've always seen you as.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
So basically is the perception or the way you consider that person.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
The way you think about that person.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
So I can say I've always seen you as a good friend.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I've always seen you as a leader.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Okay.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
So our last phrase is also the last thing we heard in the dialogue.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
He said, are you willing to give me a shot?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
To give me a shot.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Give me a shot.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
All right.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I think we have some more examples of how we could use.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Give me a shot in different situations.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
So let's listen.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Example one.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I know I can do this drawing better.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Just give me a shot.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Example two.

09:30.000 --> 09:47.000
The HR manager wasn't good in the hire me, but he decided to give me a shot.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Okay.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
So when you give someone a shot, you take a chance, right?

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Give that person or give an opportunity.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Hmm.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
All right.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
So we don't know if she will give him a shot or not.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
But why don't we listen to the dialogue once more to hear these phrases in action?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Hey, you're early.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Where's everyone?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Well, I told them not to come.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Oh, why?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Sure.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
What is it?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Hmm.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Okay.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Here's the thing.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
And I can't take it anymore.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I know you better than anyone.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And I think we would be great together.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Don't you?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Are you serious?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
We've been friends for years.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
We can't just change that overnight.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
I know.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
I never had the guts to tell you until today.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
So what do you say?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Ah, ah.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Alright, so an interesting dialogue and it opens up a cultural point.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
That's right.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
So in the dialogue, the guy was asking her if she would be his girlfriend, right?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Right.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
But I guess it's not very common among adults at least in English speaking countries.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah, we don't say like, okay, so please will you be my boyfriend now.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Right, right.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
You would do that maybe in high school.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
But even then, I could get some little funny.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
I think for us, when we start to have romantic relationships,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
it just sort of happens naturally, right?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
You never really have this conversation.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Will you be my boyfriend?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Right.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
I guess afterwards you just start talking about other things which you just consider that you guys

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
are already boyfriend and girlfriend.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah, there's no real, there's no official starting point.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Yeah, there's no official point that says, okay, now we are boyfriend and girlfriend.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Yep.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Which is interesting because in other countries they do go through the formality of asking somebody

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
to become their boyfriend.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
But even like 20 or 30 years ago in English speaking countries, you would do that.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And it was called going steady.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Going steady.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
So you would ask, will you go steady with me?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
That means let's become a stable couple.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Exactly.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
All right.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
So we want to hear your stories and well, how do you do it in your country?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Do you ask someone out?

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
Do you maybe just give them the first kiss and that's an automatic yes?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Well, I don't know, but I'm looking forward to hearing from our listeners.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
So guys, check out our website EnglishPod.com.
