00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marko.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
And I'm Erica.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
And today we are going back in time.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
That's right, we're visiting the 1950s.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Alright, so we are going to the year 1950.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
And well, we are going to look at some of the typical and common words and phrases

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
that were used back in that year.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Yes, all of these words and phrases you might still hear today.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
But they are really a little bit old-fashioned.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Alright, so we have some words that we need to look at before we listen to our dialogue.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
So let's look at these words in vocabulary preview.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
We have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
The first one, sock hop.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
sock hop.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
A sock hop.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Okay, now this is very old-fashioned and probably not used anymore.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
No, not used anymore.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
But a sock hop is a school dance.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Okay, so all the kids after school would get together and dance rock and roll.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Exactly.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Exactly.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
And well, it's very popular and very common among American culture in those days.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yes, in 1950.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
So you would still maybe see this in a movie or something like that.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yep.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
And our second word is still used today.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Sadie Hawkins dance.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
A Sadie Hawkins dance.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Alright, a Sadie Hawkins dance.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
So a Sadie Hawkins dance is a dance when the girls ask the guys to be their date.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Okay, so it's a party and the guys don't invite the girls.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
No, the girls invite the guys.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay, so it's a little bit of a reverse of roles there.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yes.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
That's interesting.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
So in this case, the girls have to come up to the guys and say,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Hey, do you want to go to the dance with me?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Very good.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
So this still happens today in North America.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
So you will probably hear it sometime.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
And I guess now we could listen to our dialogue for the first time.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And it takes place at a high school.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Hey, a Tracy. How are you doing?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm swell, Sandy.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Hey, listen.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
You want to go to the soccer with me this Friday?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
It'll be a blast.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
The girls got to ask the guys.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Also, right.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
So when are you going to ask me?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I've had my eye on you for a while.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Hey, buddy, he's off my girl, man.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Where do you want a knuckle sandwich?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Cool, it does.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Your girl says who?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Says me, Pip squeak.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Alright, so a little bit of a discussion over a girl.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Very common, as well.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yep.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
So we're going to be looking at some of these words that were maybe a little bit difficult.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
In the dialogue, in language takeaway.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Language takeaway.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Well, you've got five phrases and words from the dialogue.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Now, the first thing we heard was Sandy said,

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Hey, yeah.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Hey, yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
All right.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Now, an interjection, a way of saying hi, but very old fashioned.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Hey, yep.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Basically, hi, you.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Or hey, you.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yep.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Okay, so hey, yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I guess you would still use it today, though, right?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, it's a still a normal way to to greet someone.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Alright, very friendly.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Hmm.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Okay, and what about our second word?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Well, Sandy has Tracy.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
How are you?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
And Tracy replies, I'm swell.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I'm swell.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I'm just swell.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
When you are swell, you are great.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
You're great.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
And again, swell is an old fashioned way of saying I'm good or I'm great.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Hmm.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
But you would still hear it.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yes.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And it also is used to describe things.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
That was a swell party.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Okay, swell.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yep.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
All right.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Now for our next word, they got into a fight.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
And Tracy said, cool it, guys.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Cool it.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Cool it.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Cool it.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
So why don't we listen to some examples of cool it before we explain it?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Example one.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Just cool it.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Now it's not the right time to get angry.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Example two.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
You need to cool it and stop yelling at me.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Example three.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Don't cry, Pam.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Just cool it.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
You will be okay.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
All right.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
So cool it, guys.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Basically it means relax.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Don't take it easy.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Don't get into a fight.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Hmm.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Okay.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
This is one of my dad used to say to me and my sister is all the time.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Cool it, kids.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Stop fighting.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Very good.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
So it is still very common to use.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yep.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
All right.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Now for our last two words, these are a little bit more old fashioned.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yes.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Straight from 1952, they talk about a knuckle sandwich.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
All right.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
He says, do you want a knuckle sandwich?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
A knuckle sandwich.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
What are we talking about here?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
All right.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Well, on your hand, you have above your fingers, you have your knuckles.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
So those are the bumpy parts of my hand.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
The bones on the top part of your hand.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
So he's basically saying, do you want me to punch you?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Hmm.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Do you want me to hit you with my hand with my fist?

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
So it's in very informal way of saying a punch, a knuckle sandwich.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I'll give you a knuckle sandwich.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Right.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
And for our last word, he called Tommy called Sandy, a pip squeak.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Pips squeak.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Pips squeak.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
A pip squeak.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Now this is kind of an insult, but again, very old fashioned.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Yes.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
A pip squeak is a very small person, right?

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
A small person who is not strong.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Okay.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
We're not powerful.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
So a small and a weak person.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Pips squeak.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I guess nowadays, you can still call somebody pip squeak, but maybe in a lighter sense.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
It would be a little bit funny to call someone a pip squeak.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Okay.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
So a pip squeak.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
We're going to slow it down a little bit so you can get all these words that we just looked at.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
And then we'll come back and look at some phrases.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Hey, a Tracy.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
How are you doing?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm swell, Sandy.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Hey, listen.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
You want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
It'll be a blast.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
The girls got to ask the guys.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Also.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Oh, right.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
So when are you going to ask me?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I've had my eye on you for a while.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Hey, buddy.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
He's off my girl, man.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Cool it, guys.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
You are a girl.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Says who?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Says me, pip squeak.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:18.000
So that was a little bit easier to understand, but some great 50s style phrases and words.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
So why don't we look at some of these phrases now in fluency builder?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Fluency builder.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
All right.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm fluency builder today.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
We're going to look at three phrases.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Why don't we start with the first one?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Sandy said that the party will be a blast.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
It'll be a blast.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
It'll be a blast to be a blast.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
So if something is a blast, it's very fun.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
It's entertaining.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Yes.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Really, really fun.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Okay.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
So the party was a blast.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I had a great time last night.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
It was a blast.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Okay.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Very good.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
So very fun times.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yep.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And you'll still hear this phrase used today.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Have a next one.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
So Sandy said he had his eye on Tracy.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
And he said, I've had my eye on you.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
To have your eye on someone.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
So if I have my eye on the new iPhone that came out.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
You, you are watching it carefully because you want it.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Okay.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
So I'm keeping my attention on it because I want it.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
I have my eye on that sweater because it's on sale.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Okay.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So you really want that sweater.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yep.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
All right.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So to have your eye on something or on someone.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Mm-hmm.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Right.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
And for our last phrase.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Tommy told Sandy, hey buddy, ease off my girl.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
ease off ease off.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
All right.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we could use ease off because it might

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
be a little bit tricky.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And then we'll come back and talk about it.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Example one.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
You need to ease off the junk food.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Example two.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Matt is putting so much pressure on me these days.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
I wish he would ease off.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Example three.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
You're pushing Susie too much.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
You need to ease off a bit.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Okay.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
So what looks like you say this phrase ease off.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
When somebody is putting pressure on you or doing something to you that they shouldn't.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Right.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Maybe they're being too intense or maybe annoying you.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Mm-hmm.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
So you tell them hey ease off.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Relax.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Stay back.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Stay away.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Very good.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
So ease off my girlfriend.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
ease off the fatty foods.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
All right.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
So take it easy.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Stay away from.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Yep.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Okay.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
So some great phrases there.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
I think it's a good idea for us to listen to our dialogue one more time.

09:51.000 --> 10:01.000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about the 1950s.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Hey, you're Tracy.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
How are you doing?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
I'm Swail Sandy.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Hey, listen.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
You want to go to the soccer with me this Friday?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
It'll be a blast.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
First of all, is the Sadie Hawkins dance.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
The girls got to ask the guys.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Also.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
All right.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
So when are you going to ask me?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I've had my eye on you for a while.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Hey, buddy.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
He's off my girl, man.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Cool.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
It guys.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Your girl says who?

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
Says me, Pip Squeak.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Okay.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So the 1950s and nice era.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
And this is the first of a small series that we're going to have of different words.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
And phrases that were used back in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, etc.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
That's right.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
So a little bit more time travel is coming up here in English pod.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Exactly.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
Because a lot of these phrases are still used and you might even see them in movies or if you're

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
talking to somebody that was maybe born in these eras, they might even still use them today.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
That's right.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.240
So do you guys know any English phrases or slangs from the 1950s?

11:11.240 --> 11:16.000
