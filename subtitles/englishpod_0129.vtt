00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to English Pod at my name is Marko.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
And I'm Erica, and today we're bringing you part two of the presidential farewell speech of President Eisenhower.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
That's right, so we saw in a previous lesson the beginning of this speech.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Now we're going to look toward the end of this speech.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Now we must tell you as well that we did change the speech a little bit, right?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
We changed a little bit to make it a little bit more comprehensible,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
also we did shorten it, the speech isn't this short.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Okay, take out a lot of stuff.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
All right, so again, Marko, why are we looking at this speech?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
What are we learning from it?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Well, in this last part of the presidential farewell speech,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
there are a lot of great words that are more difficult and very poetic,

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
so you can use them in different formal circumstances,

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
or just to sound a little bit more well spoken.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah, and we also again are going to look at some really quite difficult and challenging structures

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
that we hope you can use maybe when you're when you're giving a formal talk,

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
or yeah, or even in your writing, if you want to sound quite professional.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Okay, very good.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Let's listen how President Eisenhower says goodbye,

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
and then we'll come back and look at the words.

01:15.000 --> 01:26.000
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Three of these involved our own country.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest,

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
the most influential, and the most productive nation in the world.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
We are understandably proud of this preeminence,

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
yet we realize that America's leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress,

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace,

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity among peoples and among nations.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied,

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full,

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings,

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
that those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity,

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
that the scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth,

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
and that in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I am proud to do so. I look forward to it.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Thank you, and good night.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Well, that certainly was a very moving speech.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Very moving, and to a certain point, a little bit religious, huh?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, I think we'll talk a little bit about that a little bit later,

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
but let's concentrate on the language now, so we'll go to language takeaway.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Language takeaway.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
Alright, on language takeaway today, we'll start with our first word, and it's pre-eminence.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Alright, we are understandably proud of this pre-eminence.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Hey, pre-eminence.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
So pre-eminence, what is this?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Basically, it's the state of being the leader of something.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay, so in this case, America was the pre-eminence nation.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
Right, so they were coming up, they were very prosperous, so they had a pre-eminence in the world.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
Alright, so I think we can see here, you can use this as an adjective, a pre-eminence nation,

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
or as a noun, an uncountable noun, the pre-eminence of our state.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Very good.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Since we can use this word as a noun and an adjective, why don't we listen to some more example,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
so we can get a better understanding of it?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Example one.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
Now, please welcome Dr. Frank Hicks, the world's most pre-eminent expert on nuclear biology.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Example two.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
He's been a leader in his field for 25 years, and his pre-eminence has never been questioned.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Example three.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
Carol Dixon is one of the most pre-eminent experts in green technology.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Alright, well, Eisenhower is talking about all of the things that the American people had

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
done since they became a free nation, and one of these things was to foster progress in human achievement.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Foster progress in human achievement.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, I like this verb a lot to foster something.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
So, if I say to foster progress or to foster something, what am I saying?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
To help something grow and develop.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
To take care of it, to nurse it.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah, we very commonly hear this word associated with children, right?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
A foster child.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah, so what's that?

05:08.000 --> 05:15.000
If you have a foster child, you are basically taking care of a child because the parents can look after them.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
It's not like a dobbling because you don't actually, it's not actually legal.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
It's just that you're helping somebody out by raising this child.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Right.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
So we can see the connection there, a foster child, to foster something.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
But you know, this is really a great word.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
And I think it would help to give a couple of examples of how we could use it.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
So for example, I can say our company is looking to foster better creativity in the workplace.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
Or we could say, here at Praxis Language, we foster the development of your English.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Very good.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
So the word foster.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
Now moving on in his speech, he was talking about nations and faiths and different types of groups.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
And he said, all who yearn for freedom.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
All right.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
This, this is a great phrase, all who yearn for freedom.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
To yearn.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
So to yearn for something.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Now if I yearn for freedom or I yearn for something,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
it's basically that I really wanted in my heart.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yeah.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
You really wish for it in a way that's almost, almost painful.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
You know, you, you want it so badly.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Now you wouldn't say like, I'm yearning for ice cream would you?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
No.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Unless you were locked up in prison and hadn't had ice cream for 55 years.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Exactly.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
So it's usually related to something that's very difficult to get or something like freedom or yearning for.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
That's really important.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Exactly.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Something very important.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
And now for our last word,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
President Eisenhower was talking about charity.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
He was talking about freedom.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And he mentioned the scoreges of poverty.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Okay.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
So scoreges.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
The scoreges of poverty.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Scoreges is a really difficult but interesting word.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
So why don't we hear a few more examples to help us understand it?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Example one.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
Malaria is a disease that continues to be discouraged to the developing world.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Example two.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
One day we hope to eliminate the scores of cancer.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Example three.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
NATO promises to wipe out the scores of terrorism.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
So as we can see, the scoreges of something basically is the cause of pain or suffering.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
So now relating it back to the text, we see the scoreges of poverty.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah, scoreges of poverty, scoreges of disease and scoreges of ignorance.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
All right.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
So we can see that poverty, ignorance and disease cause a lot of really terrible things, right?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Exactly.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
So that's why we say they are scoreges.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
So scoreges.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Now that brings us to the end of our words for takeaway today.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
But, you know, as we talked to earlier,

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
we've got some really difficult and interesting structures to look at now in fluency builder.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Fluency builder.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Okay.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
So there we'll start off with the very first sentence of the paragraph.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
When you said, we now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Okay.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
So I love this phrase.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of the century.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
Now, it's interesting because he is making reference to the future in the present.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Mm-hmm.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And he's using a great phrase to do that.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
We now stand.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Mm-hmm.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Now we can change it a little bit and use the first part.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
We now stand in different circumstances.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
So why don't we listen to a couple of examples.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Example one.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
We now stand before you to declare our love and be united in marriage.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Example two.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I stand before this chord and declare my innocence.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Example three.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
Together, we now stand before this great challenge and we will fight arm and arm to defeat poverty.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
All right.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
So you can see that this is a wonderful phrase to use maybe in a formal speech, right?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Right or a wedding again or a formal ceremony.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
So, and it gives you this idea, the sort of very poetic image of people sort of almost standing at the cliffs,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
standing before the, you know, some big change that's about to take place.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Exactly.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
So 10 years past the midpoint of a century that United States has witnessed four major wars, right?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Okay.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
And well, he said, despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today, the strongest,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
the most influential and most productive nation in the world.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Okay.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
So a great, great, great structure here.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America today is the strongest, blah, blah, blah.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Right.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Now let's look at that first word, despite the carnage of these conflicts.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Okay.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
So carnage, what's that carnage is like a massacre, right?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Where many people got hurt or killed.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Okay.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
So a pretty violent situation when a lot of people died.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Mm-hmm.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
And now, why does he use this word, despite?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay.

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
So he's basically saying, even though we had all of this death and violence in this century,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
we're still the greatest nation, blah, blah, blah, blah.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Exactly.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
That's exactly it.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.800
For example, despite the economic crisis the world is going through, our company has an enormous

10:21.800 --> 10:24.000
opportunity to grow and be more profitable.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Okay.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Or if we want to take it, imagine we're at a wedding, we might say something like this.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
You could say, despite the many difficulties this couple has faced, they have a very bright

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
and happy future together.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Very good.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
And now, if we take a look at the last paragraph, it's very interesting because it's

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
one sentence.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
It's a really long sentence.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
It's a very long sentence.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
So even though it's not a phrase, let's take a look at the punctuation of this paragraph.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Okay.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
So I think how it starts out by saying, we pray that people's of all face, all races, all

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
nations may have their great human needs satisfied.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
And then we have a semi-colon there, right?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Right.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
So why do we have a semi-colon?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, here's what he's doing.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
He's saying, we pray for something.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Mm-hmm.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
And then he's listing the many different things that he's praying for.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Okay.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So it's basically a list.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yep.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Okay.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
So we know that when you're writing a list, we commonly use commas between all the things that

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
are in this list.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Mm-hmm.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
But here, because they are long and complex ideas, a comma is not enough.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Right.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
You need a semi-colon.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Okay.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
So we can see here from the text that the semi-colon is a great way to separate ideas.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Yeah, big ideas, complex ideas in a list.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Exactly.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
So you can use it and not necessarily have to end your sentence or that each idea become

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
one sentence.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
You can all just make it in one big sentence.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Yep.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
And actually, I remember back to high school Marco, my teacher told me, hey, if you throw in a few

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
semicolons into your writing and do it properly, you'll really impress people.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
All right.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
So this is good advice that you can take.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
And throw in a couple of semi-colons, a little bit of commas here and there.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
And both, it looked like you really know how to write.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Yep.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Okay.

12:13.000 --> 12:24.000
So with that in mind, why don't we listen to what Eisenhower wrote one last time?

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
among great nations.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Three of these involved our own country.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
and the most productive nation in the world.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
We are understandably proud of this preeminence.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
Yet we realize that America's leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
material progress, riches, and military strength.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
But on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Throughout America's adventure and free government, such basic purposes have been

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
to keep the peace, to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity,

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
and integrity among peoples and among nations.

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied,

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
That all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings,

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
that those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities,

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity,

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
that the scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
And that in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
by the binding force of mutual respect and love.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
I am proud to do so. I look forward to it. Thank you, and good night.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
Alright, we're back, and we're here again with Pete, our voice actor for the second part of the dialogue,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
and we have a couple more questions for you today. Cool.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
So, I hear in Eisenhower's speech that he keeps referencing God.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Like, he keeps saying, I pray, blah, blah, blah, blah, he said Godspeed, blah, blah, blah.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
So, what's up with that? Why is he talking about God?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Well, this is a very interesting question.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Traditionally, America has had a really clear boundary between church and state,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
and you'll hear a lot of rhetoric these days that says, you know,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
we're a Christian nation, and we were founded as a Christian nation.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Well, that's baloney.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Baloney, it's not true.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
At the time when the country was founded 200 years ago,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
it was overwhelmingly Christian.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
If the founding fathers, as we call them, the George Washington,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
and if they had wanted a Christian nation, they could have had it.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
They explicitly did not, and a lot of people since then have gotten that confused.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And now, when we have a very large Muslim population, we have Buddhists,

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
we have people in all various different kinds of, you know,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Mormonism and everything, it's even less possible now.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
So, I'm kind of baffled when I hear people say that America is a Christian nation.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
But you even have it now in the coins, like on the money, right?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
It says in God, we trust.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
That started in the early 20th century.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I think that was Teddy Roosevelt.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
He opposed that.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Roosevelt was really opposed to that.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
But, and then what happened, they approved it.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Yeah.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
And, you know, people said later, like Eisenhower talking about this stuff,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
you know, in America, we have something called the Pledge of Allegiance,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
which I don't think you guys probably have.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Not in Canadian.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Yeah.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Obviously, you wouldn't do it to America, but to your own.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It's kind of, like, a salute to the flag, right?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah, it's a little bit nationalist.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I did it growing up.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
You put your hand over your heart, and you face the flag,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
and you say, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
and to the Republic for which it stands,

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
That part about one nation under God, that was added in the 50s,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
as a kind of way of showing that America is not,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
quote unquote, a godless communist country.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Wow.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah, because communism teaches, you know, no religion,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
and so they, make sure we're not communist, you know?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Okay, but we don't think that, right?

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm all about tolerance, so I think that's kind of absurd.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Okay, so what I think is really interesting, though,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
is that every political speech,

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
every time a political leader has to say something publicly,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
he'll always quote God, right?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Right.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
And they'll often end a speech with, you know,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
thank you and Godless America or something.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah, exactly.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Which, you know what?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
For me, as a Canadian, is really strange.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Like, if a Canadian president said,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
God bless Canada,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
everyone would, no one would know what to do.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I don't know.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Anyway, I had an ex-girlfriend who was British,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
and she, like, Tony Blair started with that a couple times.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
He said, you know, and God bless us all, or something,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
and she was just put off by it,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
and she was like, the Brits will never take this,

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
and they didn't.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
No one was impressed.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
All right, well, an interesting feature of American history,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
politics, and societies.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
So thanks for that insight, Pete.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Cool, my pleasure.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah, and if you guys have any comments or any suggestions

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
about this lesson or any upcoming lessons, just let us know.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Or American politics in general.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
We'll try to stop in on the forum,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
and see if I can answer a question or two.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
That would be awesome.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
So visit us at EnglishPod.com

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
and Marco and myself and Pete are around to answer your questions.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
All right, we'll see you guys there.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.
