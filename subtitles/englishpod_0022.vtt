That's right. In today's lesson we'll be learning some great Christmas vocabulary and police

00:25.520 --> 00:31.840
related vocabulary as well. Now Christmas, police vocabulary how exactly does that fit together?

00:32.640 --> 00:38.400
Well they don't. But here at EnglishPod we can make anything happen so that's why we have done

00:38.400 --> 00:43.840
this to be creative, to be creative. So let's take a look at our vocabulary preview for this lesson.

00:44.800 --> 00:50.480
The vocabulary preview. In today's vocabulary preview we've got two words from our dialogue

00:50.480 --> 00:58.640
that you will need to know to understand this dialogue. The first one is elves, elves, elves, elves,

00:58.640 --> 01:07.360
and this is the plural of the word elf, right? So elves are little people, little people with

01:07.360 --> 01:15.120
pointy hats, but pointy hats sense as helpers. Okay so elves, elves, our next word is candy cane,

01:15.200 --> 01:22.000
candy cane, candy cane, candy cane. So a candy cane is a traditional Christmas candy, right?

01:22.640 --> 01:29.360

01:34.880 --> 01:40.320
Okay well I guess we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the first time and it's going to be

01:40.320 --> 01:44.960
kind of fast, but don't worry if you don't understand everything because we'll come back and talk

01:44.960 --> 01:48.960
about some of the language later.

01:55.680 --> 02:01.760
Really far as you can't take me to jail, don't you know who I am? Chris Kringle you know,

02:07.360 --> 02:13.040
that one before, haven't we Joe? Yeah last week we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

02:13.040 --> 02:20.320
Can you believe that? That's Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to deliver. Where's your

02:20.320 --> 02:25.920
Christmas spirit? What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts on

02:25.920 --> 02:32.480
their stockings? Sorry buddy you're part in a no-pocking zone, you were speeding and you have no

02:33.440 --> 02:38.320

02:38.320 --> 02:47.680
city zoo. What? This is unbelievable. What's this world coming through? Christmas is ruined.

02:47.680 --> 02:53.520
What's that up ahead? It looks like hells. Whoa there are shooting candycains.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.200
Mayday, mayday, we're under heavy attack. We need backup.

03:10.400 --> 03:17.200
Okay so Santa has escaped from the police car. Thank God it's like a war over there. They were

03:17.200 --> 03:23.440
really firing everything. I know I mean those elves are aggressive. Very aggressive.

03:24.480 --> 03:30.240
Okay well we can take a look at some great vocabulary from this dialogue. Why don't we start with our

03:30.240 --> 03:39.280
language takeaway for today? Language takeaway. In today's language takeaway we have five really

03:39.280 --> 03:45.280
important words that we hope you will take away from the lesson. Exactly and the first word that we

03:45.360 --> 03:53.600
have today is booked booked booked booked booked is another way of saying a rested. A rested.

03:53.600 --> 03:58.320
Yeah it's a slang word hey. It's kind of slang yeah yeah it's a slang word booked.

03:58.320 --> 04:05.600
Okay next word speeding speeding speeding. So Santa was speeding because he was

04:06.480 --> 04:10.960
going too fast driving too fast yeah going over the speed limit. Exactly.

04:11.840 --> 04:20.320
Third word today is impounded. Impounded. Impounded. That's when your car gets arrested.

04:20.320 --> 04:27.920
Your car gets arrested. Yeah they take your car to car jail. Okay so my car is in car jail.

04:27.920 --> 04:33.120
I think I understand. It's impounded. Okay so the police take my car and I have to

04:33.200 --> 04:43.280
pay to get it out. Okay let's move to our next word ruined ruined ruined ruined ruined.

04:43.280 --> 04:47.840
We have a few examples for us to listen to to understand the meaning of this word.

04:49.040 --> 04:54.560
Example one. It's been raining for five days.

04:54.880 --> 05:09.040
Ofication is ruined. Example two. Look at this hole you've ruined my favorite pair of jeans.

05:12.640 --> 05:20.480
Example three. Sam you've been caught stealing from the company. Your chances for a

05:20.480 --> 05:30.720
permission are ruined. Okay great examples and basically ruined of means destroy destroyed.

05:30.720 --> 05:38.080
Yeah messed up messed up. Okay now for our last word back up. Back up.

05:38.880 --> 05:47.920
So now for our last word. Okay so now for our last word and language takeaway. Back up. Back up.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.680
Back up. Back up. So backup is help help. Yeah right. So when you call for backup you call for help.

05:55.680 --> 06:00.880
Yeah you see it all the time in war movies police call for backup. Yeah right. I think though

06:00.880 --> 06:06.560
it's important to point out that here the pronunciation and stress of this phrase is really

06:06.560 --> 06:13.200
important hey. Yes yes. You have to say backup. Back up. Back up. Yeah. So both words are

06:13.280 --> 06:20.240
stressed at about the same level hey. Back up. Because if you were to stay back up that means to

06:20.240 --> 06:26.880
move back exactly. Yeah it's different. So backup. Back up. Yes. The stress is important.

06:26.880 --> 06:31.680
The stress. All right well you know what I think with those words in mind it's time for us

06:31.680 --> 06:33.760
to listen to the dialogue a second time.

06:34.720 --> 06:47.760
Really fellas you can't take me to jail. Don't you know who I am? Chris Kringle you know

06:47.760 --> 06:57.520
popping a well. Pernawell. Bob on the Tully. Shondan on Ren. Yeah yeah we've heard that one before.

06:57.600 --> 07:03.600
Haven't we Joe? Yeah last week we booked this guy who claimed to be the tooth fairy.

07:03.600 --> 07:12.160
Can you believe that? It's Christmas Eve and I have all these presents to deliver. Where's your

07:12.160 --> 07:18.560
Christmas spirit? What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow and don't find any gifts

07:18.560 --> 07:26.240
in their stockings? Sorry buddy you were parked in a no-pocking zone you were speeding and you

07:26.560 --> 07:33.360
have no idea. Besides that even if we let you go now your sleigh has been impounded and those

07:33.360 --> 07:42.160
reindeer were taken to the city zoo. What? This is unbelievable. What's the world coming though?

07:42.160 --> 07:51.120
Christmas is ruined. What's that up ahead? He looks like elves. Whoa there's shooting candy

07:51.200 --> 07:57.600
keys. Made a. Made a. We are under heavy attack. We need backup.

08:02.160 --> 08:07.920
Okay so without the sound effects and without any noise I think it's much more clear now right?

08:07.920 --> 08:13.680
A little less dramatic. A less dramatic but good language. Yes speaking of good language there's

08:13.680 --> 08:17.840
some great phrases I want to look at in this dialogue and so let's do that in putting it together.

08:18.800 --> 08:26.960
Putting it together. We have two phrases in putting it together that we want to show you how

08:26.960 --> 08:33.520
you can use in many different situations. In the dialogue we heard this. Last week we booked

08:33.520 --> 08:38.800
this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy. Last week we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

08:39.840 --> 08:45.440
So when you claim to be something you're saying that you are something but it might not be true right?

08:45.440 --> 08:51.840
Right so for example you can say this woman claimed to be your wife but she's not but she's not.

08:51.840 --> 08:56.960
Okay we have a few other examples of how you can use the phrase claim to.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.360
Example one.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.480
Daniel claimed to be the son of a government minister but later we found out that he was lying.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.120
Example two.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.520
The criminals claim to have a gun.

09:21.840 --> 09:22.960
Example three.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.560
This man here is claiming to know your father.

09:31.840 --> 09:37.200
That's such a great phrase just by putting it together with another verb means something different but

09:37.200 --> 09:43.600
still expresses that same idea. Right claim to have she claimed to have a baby or something.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.480
Yeah okay okay so let's move to our next phrase.

09:47.280 --> 09:51.680
Under heavy. Under heavy. Under heavy.

09:51.680 --> 09:57.760
So when the dialogue they said we're under heavy attack. Right you can also use this phrase in a couple

09:57.760 --> 10:01.360
of other ways. Example one.

10:03.680 --> 10:04.960
We're in the heavy attack.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.040
Example two.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.640
We're under heavy fire.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.320
Example three.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.800
The prime minister is in the heavy security.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.720
So if you're under heavy fire means that there's a lot of fire.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.840
Like gun fire. Gun fire. Yeah not like fire fire.

10:29.840 --> 10:36.320
Yeah okay and if you're under heavy security it means that you have a lot of security.

10:36.320 --> 10:41.360
A lot of body guards or a lot of right like a prime minister a president will be under heavy

10:41.440 --> 10:44.880
security exactly okay. A couple of great phrases.

10:44.880 --> 10:48.880
Really good phrases and with this we can listen to our dialogue a third time.

10:59.760 --> 11:05.920
Really it's hard. You can't take me to jail. Don't you know who I am? Chris Crangle you know

11:06.000 --> 11:10.160
Papa no well per no well. Papa no toilet. Shut up all time.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.040
Yeah yeah we've heard that one before. Haven't we Joe?

11:13.840 --> 11:17.040
Yeah last week we booked this guy who claimed to be a tooth fairy.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.200
Can you believe that?

11:19.840 --> 11:23.680
That's Chris machine even I have all these presents to deliver.

11:23.680 --> 11:28.320
Where's your Christmas spirit? What will happen when all the children wake up tomorrow

11:28.320 --> 11:30.800
and don't find any gifts on their stockings?

11:31.680 --> 11:36.880
Sorry buddy you're part in a no-pocking zone. You were speeding and you have no ID.

11:37.520 --> 11:42.320
Besides that even if we let you go now your slaves been impounded and those reindeer were taken to the

11:42.320 --> 11:49.520
city zoo. What? This is unbelievable. What's this world coming through?

11:49.520 --> 11:53.440
Christmas is ruined. What's that up ahead? It looks like

11:54.400 --> 11:58.000
Ells. Whoa there are shooting candycains.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.200
Mayday mayday we're under heavy attack. We need backup.

12:12.240 --> 12:17.760
So Marko the police mentioned something about the tooth fairy. The tooth fairy.

12:17.760 --> 12:22.080
I don't know maybe some of our listeners don't know the story about the tooth fairy so

12:23.440 --> 12:28.480
can I go ahead and say it? Yes go ahead. Okay well when you're small and you lose the tooth

12:28.480 --> 12:34.560
your baby teeth. Yeah you put it underneath your pillow and then you go to sleep and then in the

12:34.560 --> 12:41.120
night the tooth fairy comes into the house flies into the house sneaks under your pillow

12:41.120 --> 12:47.120
takes the tooth and puts money there. I see. So this is a story that parents tell their kids about

12:47.120 --> 12:51.360
what happens to their baby teeth and they get money exchange for it. Right so I guess it takes away

12:51.360 --> 12:56.960
the sadness of losing that tooth. Yeah yeah. But in South America for example we have

12:57.680 --> 13:03.520
the tooth mouse. The tooth mouse. Yes. Okay mouse. What is it? How does it call it in Spanish?

13:03.520 --> 13:08.800
Well in some places it's called raton cito peris. Uh huh. Like it has a last name

13:08.800 --> 13:14.640
peris. Oh really? Uh in other places it's just called raton cito raton which means mouse.

13:14.640 --> 13:19.840
Okay so it'd be like tooth fairy Smith. To be a tooth fairy Smith. And it's the same thing. It's

13:19.840 --> 13:24.240
a little mouse that comes in and steals a little tooth from you and leaves money in exchange.

13:24.800 --> 13:30.880
Cool. Very cool. Yeah. So we go from Santa Claus to Guns and Wars to the tooth fairy.

13:30.880 --> 13:35.520
Only yet English pod. Exactly. All right guys I hope you enjoyed today's lesson.

13:35.520 --> 13:41.760
