00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
Hello English learners, welcome back to English pod, my name is Marko, and I'm Erica.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.040
And today we're swimming.

00:09.040 --> 00:13.840
That's right, a nice summer time lesson for a new time lesson.

00:13.840 --> 00:18.400
So we're going to be talking about swimming and well, it's a very popular sport, right?

00:18.400 --> 00:22.320
Yeah, so this is another lesson in our sports series.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.240
And our sports series, okay.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.440
So why don't we preview some of the language we'll find in the dialogue?

00:28.400 --> 00:30.000
Very calorie preview.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.080
All right, we have two words to look at here.

00:34.080 --> 00:40.560
Uh, the first word is sailing sailing sailing sailing sailing.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.960
Well, this is the verb to sail, right?

00:44.000 --> 00:49.360
So sailing is traveling in a boat in a boat with no engine.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.640
Right, so you must use the wind to push you forward.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.160
Exactly, that's a sail boat.

00:54.160 --> 00:54.640
Yes.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.640
Okay, so sailing, hmm.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.600
Now let's take a look at our other word, anchor.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.760
Another boat word here, anchor anchor anchor.

01:03.760 --> 01:08.880
Now it's spelled A and C H O R, right?

01:08.880 --> 01:11.760
But you don't pronounce the CH as you normally would, right?

01:11.760 --> 01:16.160
Another one of these really difficult to spell English words, right?

01:16.160 --> 01:20.640
So you don't say anchore, you would say anchor anchor anchor.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.440
Anchor.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.680
So the anchor is a verb and noun.

01:23.680 --> 01:24.400
That's right.

01:24.400 --> 01:29.680
Well, when anchor is used as a noun, it means the hook that you throw over the boat

01:29.680 --> 01:33.760
into the water and it keeps you staying in the same place.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.480
Okay, but the verb to anchor.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.040
Yes.

01:37.040 --> 01:37.920
What does it mean?

01:37.920 --> 01:38.560
To do that.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.920
To do that, right?

01:39.920 --> 01:43.040
So you, so to throw the anchor into the water,

01:43.040 --> 01:45.120
you would just say to anchor the boat.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.600
Exactly, to keep it in the same place.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.800
Okay, great words related to sailing.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.280
But now let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.800
What's happening here, Erica?

01:54.800 --> 01:58.240
Well, we've got two friends here who are sailing in their boat

01:58.240 --> 01:59.840
and they decide to take a swim.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.440
Hmm, let's see what happens.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.360
This is such a beautiful day.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.720
Great day for sailing.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.920
It sure is.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.920
The water looks so nice.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.600
Anchor the boat for a little while.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.680
I'm going to take a dip.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.040
Why are you doggy paddling?

02:27.040 --> 02:28.480
I taught you how to swim.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.320
Do your breaststroke.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.720
I get too tired.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.920
I'll just backstroke.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.640
It's easier.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.680
Try kicking your legs more.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.680
That's good.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.280
Don't go out too far.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.040
It's fine.

02:43.040 --> 02:43.600
Jump in.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.280
Kathy, get back here.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.240
I see a shark.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.880
Help me!

02:50.880 --> 02:52.160
Help!

02:52.160 --> 02:54.000
Bring the boat closer.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.160
The shark is coming straight towards me.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.040
It's right under you, Kathy.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.000
All right, so a shark attack.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.440
I know this is my worst fear when swimming.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.120
Really in the ocean, right?

03:11.120 --> 03:12.800
Yeah, well, also in the lake.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.280
But no sharks in the lake.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.400
I know what I'm still afraid about.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.280
All right, so don't worry about it.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.400
I'm sure the girl is okay.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.320
It's probably not a shark.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.520
Maybe it was a dolphin.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.920
Yeah, or maybe she's going to punch the shark in the face.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.080
And she'll escape.

03:28.080 --> 03:32.240
Okay, let's take a look at some of the words that we saw in language takeaway.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.800
Language takeaway.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.120
We have three excellent swimming words for you.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.920
The first one is doggy paddling.

03:41.920 --> 03:42.960
Doggy paddling.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.240
Doggy paddling.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.840
So doggy paddling.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.240
It's not really a proper way of swimming, right?

03:48.320 --> 03:50.880
No, you don't see this in the Olympics.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.280
So if you've ever seen a dog swim,

03:53.280 --> 03:55.120
that's why they call it doggy paddling.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.720
Right, you're sort of moving your hands quickly in front of you.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.400
And your legs are all over the place.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.320
Yeah, and you're basically not really swimming.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.960
You're just trying to stay afloat.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.320
You're trying not to drown.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.200
Trying not to sink.

04:07.200 --> 04:07.840
Yeah.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.160
Yep.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.600
Okay, so doggy paddling.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.000
Again, this can be a noun or a verb.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.200
The doggy paddle.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.800
This swimming style or doggy paddling.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.160
Okay, interesting.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.400
All right, let's take a look at our second swimming style.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.520
Breast stroke.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.640
Breast stroke.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.680
Breast stroke.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.040
The breast stroke.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.160
How is this one?

04:28.160 --> 04:30.320
Well, it's sort of like swimming like a frog.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.640
So you have your legs that are similar to like a frog, right?

04:34.640 --> 04:35.920
And what are your hands doing?

04:35.920 --> 04:39.920
Your hands are moving in front of you together.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.280
Then out towards the side.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.680
Okay, so you're kind of doing circles.

04:45.760 --> 04:46.720
Yeah, half circles.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.920
Half circles.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.680
Okay, breast stroke.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.640
Yeah, but you get kind of tired when you swim like this, right?

04:52.640 --> 04:53.600
Yeah, maybe.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.640
Yeah, yeah.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.040
Now, let's take a look at our third word.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.040
Backstroke.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.160
Backstroke.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.120
Backstroke.

05:01.120 --> 05:01.920
Backstroke.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.280
So this one's pretty easy.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.760
Backstroke, you are lying on your back.

05:05.760 --> 05:06.640
You're lying on your back.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.200
In the water.

05:07.200 --> 05:07.920
Mm-hmm.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.760
And you're keen your feet as well.

05:09.760 --> 05:10.560
Yep.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.680
But what are your hands doing?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.520
They're going back behind you.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.720
See, I'm doing it now.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.480
All right, if you guys could be here in the studio,

05:18.480 --> 05:20.880
you would see Erica doing her backstroke.

05:20.880 --> 05:21.920
Yeah, I'm pretty good at it.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.200
Yeah.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.080
Okay, so let's listen to this dialogue again.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.560
And then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.720
This is such a beautiful day.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.520
Great day for sailing.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.120
It sure is.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.520
The water looks so nice.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.520
Anchor the boat for a little while.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.120
I'm going to take a dip.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.800
Why are you doggy paddling?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.640
I'll talk you how to swim.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.560
Do your breaststroke.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.800
I get too tired.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.320
I'll just backstroke.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.920
It's easier.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.360
Try kicking your legs more.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.360
That's good.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.200
Don't go out too far.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.360
It's fine.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.080
Jump in.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.080
Kathy, get back here.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.200
I see a shark.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.640
Help me.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.920
Help.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.840
Bring the boat closer.

06:19.840 --> 06:23.040
The shark is coming straight towards me.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.120
It's right under you.

06:25.120 --> 06:25.920
Kathy.

06:30.880 --> 06:35.680
Okay, so we have some really good phrases related to swimming and water.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.160
Yeah, okay, let's take a look at these in fluency builder.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.320
Fluency builder.

06:40.320 --> 06:40.960
All right.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.800
The first one, I love this phrase.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.360
Take a dip.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.320
Take a dip.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.600
Take a dip.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.880
So if I say, I'm going to take a dip.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.800
You're going to have a quick swim.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.600
A quick swim.

06:53.600 --> 06:53.840
Yep.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.000
So you can take a dip in the pool.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.400
Yep.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.360
In the lake.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.080
In the ocean.

06:58.080 --> 06:58.880
In the ocean.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.560
Even in your bathtub, right?

07:00.560 --> 07:01.440
No, no.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.480
No, it's just for swimming.

07:03.120 --> 07:06.240
Unless your bathtub is really, really, really, big.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.600
All right, so not for the bathtub, but for swimming.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.240
Yep.

07:10.320 --> 07:15.200
Okay, now let's take a look at our second phrase for a little while.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.480
For a little while.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.600
For a little while.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.240
For a little while.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.000
This is really common.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.720
I use this a lot.

07:20.720 --> 07:21.280
Yeah, me too.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.040
I probably use it 500 times a day.

07:24.080 --> 07:28.400
Okay, so let's listen to some examples with for a little while.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.840
And then we'll come back and explain it.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.520
Example one.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.360
I'm tired.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.960
I'm just going to sit down for a little while.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.360
Example two.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.720
It will only hurt for a little while.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.840
Example three.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.880
Do you want to play tennis for a little while?

07:48.640 --> 07:51.520
So it means for a short time for a short time.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.480
And you can change it, right?

07:52.480 --> 07:55.440
You can say, oh, I'm going to play for a little while.

07:55.440 --> 07:55.840
Yeah.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.440
Or I'm going to sleep for a little while for a short time.

07:59.440 --> 07:59.840
Yep.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.640
All right, so if learners use this phrase,

08:02.640 --> 08:04.800
I find it sounds really, really great.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.560
Because it's not something that students normally use.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.360
Yeah, I guess a student wouldn't really use this phrase normally.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.000
Yeah, so guys use it because you'll sound awesome.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.760
Yeah, you'll sound really, really fluent.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.800
Okay, and let's take a look at our last phrase.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.880
Straight towards.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.400
Straight towards.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.600
Straight towards me.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.640
Straight towards.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.800
Okay, so straight means directly.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.920
Right, in a line.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.920
In a line, not going anywhere else, but directly.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.920
Not moving side to side.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.160
And towards is in that direction.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.600
So the shark was coming straight towards me.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.680
It's coming directly at me.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.720
Moving in a line and not moving side to side.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.960
Okay, so can you give me another example of how you would use straight towards?

08:49.680 --> 08:52.160
Watch out, there's a car coming straight towards you.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.160
Okay, directly towards you.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.040
Yeah, or maybe when I get home from work,

08:57.040 --> 08:58.960
I go straight towards the fridge.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.440
Really?

08:59.440 --> 09:00.080
Yes.

09:00.080 --> 09:00.800
I believe this.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.840
All right, so straight towards directly.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.640
Okay, so we've looked at a lot of great words.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.920
Really good phrases.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.320
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.280
And then we'll come back.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.000
And Eric is going to tell us a really great story about, oh.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.480
This is such a beautiful day.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.760
Great day for sailing.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.120
It sure is.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.040
The water looks so nice.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.800
Anchor the boat for a little while.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.760
I'm going to take a dip.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.160
Why are you doggy paddling?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.600
I taught you how to swim.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.440
Do your breaststroke.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.280
I get too tired.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.120
I'll just backstroke.

09:45.120 --> 09:45.840
It's easier.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.880
Try kicking your legs more.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.880
That's good.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.480
Don't go out too far.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.240
It's fine.

09:54.240 --> 09:54.800
Jump in.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.480
Kathy, get back here.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.280
I see a shark.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.280
Help me!

10:01.280 --> 10:03.280
Help!

10:03.280 --> 10:05.280
Bring the boat closer.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.280
The shark is coming straight towards me.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.280
It's right under you.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.280
Kathy!

10:13.280 --> 10:19.280
All right, well, Marco, I was telling you that I used to spend every summer on the lake.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.240
Mm-hmm.

10:20.240 --> 10:25.280
And my family had a really small house on a small island.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.240
Mm-hmm.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.720
My cousins had another small house on another small island.

10:30.720 --> 10:31.440
Okay.

10:31.440 --> 10:37.040
So our families are really close and we used to go to one house for dinner one night.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.920
And the other house did dinner the next night.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.920
So everyone was over at my cousin's house, except for my grandfather.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.480
And so he was thinking, okay, it's late.

10:48.480 --> 10:52.800
Maybe I better go pick up my wife and see what's going on.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.240
So he goes into the boat.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.760
It's dark.

10:55.760 --> 10:56.400
Okay.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.760
There's no light on the boat.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.400
Mm-hmm.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.600
He's driving straight towards the island.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.920
When suddenly my cousin in his boat drives directly into my grandfather.

11:07.920 --> 11:08.960
So they crashed.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.760
They crashed.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.280
Two boats crashed in the lake.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.880
Yeah, and then my grandfather's boat flipped over.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.320
It turned upside down.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.120
Wow.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.560
And he fell in the water.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.920
But he was okay, right?

11:19.920 --> 11:20.720
Yeah, he was okay.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.800
But, you know, he was really angry about this.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.520
And the boat stayed in the water.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.560
And, you know, the engine fell down to the bottom.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.240
So we had to go the next morning to get the boats.

11:34.240 --> 11:40.480
And we actually had to hire some scuba divers to go to the bottom of the lake to get the engine.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.120
Wow.

11:41.120 --> 11:41.680
Yeah.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.720
Yeah, I imagine your grandpa was pretty angry.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.360
Yeah, he tells the story every year.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.560
Yeah, exactly.

11:49.520 --> 11:53.760
But, you know, I've got a million of these crazy lake stories,

11:53.760 --> 11:55.200
because my family...

11:55.200 --> 11:56.160
It always happens.

11:56.160 --> 11:56.800
Yeah, yeah.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.480
All right, guys.

11:58.480 --> 12:02.960
Well, do you have any crazy stories or any stories related to boats or to swimming?

12:02.960 --> 12:04.800
Or to shark attack or shark attacks?

12:04.800 --> 12:05.600
