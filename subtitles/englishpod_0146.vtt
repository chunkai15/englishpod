00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello everyone and welcome back to another edition here at English Pod, my name is Marco

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
and my name is Katherine and today we've got a great upper intermediate level lesson for you all about

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
ammo and human rights.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Right.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
So it's a very debatable topic people want to protect animals, mistreatment of animals

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
and this is what we're going to talk about today protecting animals and getting them rights.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Do you think animals have rights?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
I think we can leave that for the end.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
I don't want to influence the argument here in today's dialogue but as you've said,

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
I think it's very much a topic that people can go both ways on.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue as two people discuss animal rights and let's get their opinions on things.

00:48.000 --> 00:58.000
You should have seen the TV show that was on last night.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
The topic it covered was really interesting, animal rights.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Do you really believe in that?

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless and are completely at the mercy of human beings.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
I understand your point but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You can't compare apples and oranges.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Well, you are right on that point.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
At least you're doing your part.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
All right, we're back and both of them have good points right in favor and against.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
And as you said, they also talk about human rights, which is also a very important topic.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
But before we discuss this topic, why don't we take a look at the language that was used now in language takeaway?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Language takeaway.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
All right, so a language takeaway our first word today is vulnerable.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Okay, vulnerable is a great word.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
It's a way to describe something.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
And so something is vulnerable if it can't really protect itself.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
So you are in danger of being hurt.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Exactly.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So you're vulnerable now.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
This isn't only used for animals, right?

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
It can be like an army is vulnerable if they don't have strong defenses on the.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
The borders are my emotions.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm feeling vulnerable because I just had really horrible week and I'm really depressed and I'm emotionally vulnerable.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Okay, very good. So vulnerable.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
And they also talked about transgressions against human rights.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
All right, so a transgression is a thing.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
It's a noun and a transgression is like doing something harmful to or.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Against someone or something.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
So a transgression, it's a noun.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
So it is it doing something in a bad way.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Exactly. It's a bad thing.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
It's always negative.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Exactly.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
It's not positive, right?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Right. And so in many prayers, for example, in the Christian faith, you say, you know,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Lord, forgive me for my transgressions for having kind of cross the line from doing good things to bad things.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
So you're doing bad things.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Very good. So that's a good way of putting it to cross the line to kind of go beyond where you should.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
All right, so transgressions.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
And now another very serious problem in the world is poaching.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
And that's one of the things that they said they should control poaching.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
You might have heard this word in a different context because it does have another meaning.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
But I'm just going to explain the one meaning here that we're talking about, which is killing animals,

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
especially for sport or for selling their skins and their first.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Right. So that's poaching.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
What's the difference between poaching and hunting?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Hunting can be legal. Poaching is illegal.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Okay. So that's the main difference.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Hunting is usually for sport. You hunt either for food or for sport, right?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Legal hunting.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
But poaching is usually you want to sell, like you said, the fur or the skins or so.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Or the tusks on rhinos or something like that.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Exactly.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
All right. So poaching.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And then they talked about synthetic products.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
So what is, what is a synthetic product?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Well synthetic product is something that is man made.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
So it's not natural in that it doesn't come from the earth.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
The earth cotton is a natural product.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
And plastic, for example, is synthetic or another example nylon.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
nylon is a really good synthetic product.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
And so people who don't want to use animal products like wool or leather,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
they prefer to use synthetic products.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
And I think maybe you've heard this in clothing.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
It's called synthetic fibers, right? Like nylon or polyester.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Exactly.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
These are all the words that we have for language takeaway today.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
So why don't we move on now to a couple of very interesting phrases that we saw in the dialogue.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Now influence you builder.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Fluency builder.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Okay. This first phrase is, well, it's a common one.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
But it's definitely not used in very happy circumstances.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
We say that something or someone is at the mercy of someone else.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Okay. So animals are at the mercy of human beings.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
What does this mean exactly? Mercy.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
So basically, it means that the animals, in this case,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
don't have control of what's going on.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
So human beings are the ones that control everything.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
So if I decide to to kill them, then they are at my mercy.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
At my will at my whim.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Exactly. And so you could say, I'm at your mercy Marco.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Please just help me out with this.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
It's like you're the one in control.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
You're the one who can help the situation.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Will you help?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Exactly.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
At the mercy of someone.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
And then they were talking and debating this thing.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And an interesting comparison came up.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
You can't compare apples and oranges.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
All right. You're going to hit us all the time in English.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
It's not just a funny little phrase that the person uses.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It's a very common idiom.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
And so we say, it's like apples and oranges.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Or you can't compare apples and oranges.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And this is essentially saying, these are two different things.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Completely different.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Completely different.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
So I can't compare him and her because it's apples and oranges.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
They're two different things, two different people.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Right. Because that's what in the movie.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
You said they were like peas and carrots.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
They just go together.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Does that make sense?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
No, really.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Of course, come with a little bit strange like that.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
But I think the meaning is that if I say that's a big apple.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
And I say, that's a small apple.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
They're all apples.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
So I can compare them.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
But I say, this is a really big orange.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
And that's a really big apple.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, they're different.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
You just, you just can't compare them.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
All right. And towards the end, the person said that you're doing your part.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
You're doing your part.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah. So this is a hard one to understand sometimes because it's not like a part in a play.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It's more like a part in society.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
You're helping make society or culture or civilization better.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
So you're contributing.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Exactly.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
So for example, what would be an example of a person doing their part towards society?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Well, for example, I don't own a car.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
I ride my bike.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
And it's my way of doing my part to help the environment.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Okay. Very good.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
Because I can't, obviously, I can't buy a factory that's very green or I can't do all these things to change the world.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
So I'm going to do small things that those are my way of doing my part.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Okay. So like another example would be recycling that's doing your part.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Exactly.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Or in this case, the person bought only synthetic products.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Nothing made from nature.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
All right. Very good. So very interesting phrases.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And they will be right back.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
You should have seen a TV show that was on last night.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
The topic it covered was really interesting.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Animal rights.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Do you really believe in that?

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yes.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
But we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals,

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
You can't compare apples and oranges.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, you are right on that point.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
This is the reason that I don't buy leather, and I try to buy synthetic products.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
At least you're doing your part.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
All right. So a debatable topic, animals and animal rights.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
What do you think?

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
Well, I'll say this. I would be a hypocrite if I said that it's bad to hurt animals because I meet a meat eater.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I like to eat meat, and I like to wear leather.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
But I do think it's bad to mistreat animals.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
So I really, I try to buy free-range chicken or meat from places I know that treat the animals well.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
And I definitely disagree with poaching and with using animals,

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
especially endangered animals for money and cash purposes.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
So that's my position, but what's yours? I mean, I know you eat meat too.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
No, of course. And I think even though protection of animals is a very important topic,

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
and you don't want the mistreatment of these little creatures that are very vulnerable to us,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
because we're smarter than them in the end.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
But I think also, it has to do a lot with superstitions sometimes and kind of mystical and magical things.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
For example, people killing rhinos because they believe that the rhino horn has amazing,

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
curing properties or, you know, or the same thing with elephant tusks and stuff like that.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
So it also involves this certain aspect that people almost don't know any better.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
They just, they truly believe that these things actually work or that they will help them.

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
They don't consider the, like, in the dialogue said, the imbalance that they create in the environment or the consequences.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Or there might be some very serious evolutionary consequences that we cannot even imagine.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
And so, you know, things change kind of over time sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly,

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
but if we force change really quickly, who knows what their results are going to be.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
It might be really negative for us.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
Exactly. And that's what we want to know now, what do you think about these topics

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
because in the end the environment animals, they're all connected.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
If you wipe out all the foxes in a forest and you're going to have like,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
you're going to have too many snakes running around, right?

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah. So what do you think? Come to EnglishPod.com and you can where you can leave all your questions comments or suggestions and we're always there to help out.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
So we hope to see you there and until next time everyone.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Goodbye.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Bye.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Thank you.
