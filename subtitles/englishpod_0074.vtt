00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.600
And I'm Erica.

00:06.600 --> 00:11.300
Today we're bringing you an upper intermediate lesson and something that we all do.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.200
Right, talking to ourselves.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.800
Talking to ourselves, right?

00:14.800 --> 00:16.300
I think everyone does it.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.400
You think to yourself or you talk to yourself.

00:18.400 --> 00:18.900
Yep.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.900
And we're going to be doing that today, but we're going to be looking at some specific vocabulary.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.400
Erica, why don't you tell us about that?

00:24.400 --> 00:29.600
Well, unfortunately, we're going to be following a guy as he's an in a really embarrassing situation.

00:29.600 --> 00:34.300
And we're going to hear him calm self some bad name in his mind.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.700
So he's a little bit nervous and he thinks he is not very smart, right?

00:38.700 --> 00:39.700
That's right.

00:39.700 --> 00:44.200
Okay, so before we start with this dialogue, there are a couple of words that we should

00:44.200 --> 00:46.000
look at in vocabulary preview.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.800
All right, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.000
And the first one is famished.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Famished.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Famished.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.200
Okay, so famished is an adjective.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.800
That's right, meaning very, very, very hungry.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.200
Very, very hungry.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.200
Okay.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
So just very hungry.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
Very easy.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
Yes.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
Famished.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
Now, what about our next one?

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
Sexist.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Sexist.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.200
And another adjective to describe a person, right?

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
Right.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.200
Or a thing, I guess.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.200
So like, yeah, an idea.

01:16.200 --> 01:22.200
Okay, so a sexist person would be somebody who judges people by their sex.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.200
Okay.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.200
So like, all women are stupid.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.200
Which is not true, of course.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.200
No, of course not.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.200
Right.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.200
So sexist works both ways.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
Yeah.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.200
A woman can be sexist.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.200
A man could be sexist.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
Exactly.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.200
Meaning the women thinks all men are stupid, which is also not true.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.200
Yes.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
Let's just be clear about that.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
All right.

01:41.200 --> 01:46.200
So now that we've taken a look at these two phrases, let's start with our dialogue,

01:46.200 --> 01:48.200
and we'll be back to talk about all the great words.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.200
Miss, your salad.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.200
Mmm, looks good.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.200
I'm positively famished.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.200
And for you, sir.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.200
Thank you.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.200
Enjoy.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.200
Thank you.

02:09.200 --> 02:15.200
I can't believe she's on a date with me.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.200
I'm so lucky.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.200
I must be the luckiest guy in the world.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.200
I want to scream at the time of my lungs.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.200
I'm luckiest dude in the world.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.200
Oh, shut up.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.200
Don't be such a dumbass.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
She's so hot.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.200
Wait, I can't say that.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.200
Good sexist.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.200
She's so hot.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.200
She's making me sexist.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.200
Oh my god.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.200
I'm such a fool.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
Okay, get it together.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.200
Oh, she's eating salad.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
All right.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.200
Never salad.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.200
Don't crap.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.200
Which fork do I use?

02:43.200 --> 02:44.200
Damn it.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
She's going to think I'm a moron.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.200
What the hell are all these forts for?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.200
Which one did she use?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.200
Okay, chill.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.200
You go.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.200
You go.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.200
Just take a fork.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.200
Eat your salad.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.200
Mmm.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
Mmm.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
Mmm.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.200
Mmm.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
Mmm.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.200
Mmm.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.200
Mmm.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.200
Oh, sorry.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.200
What were you saying?

03:04.200 --> 03:06.200
You're eating my salad.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.200
Oh, yes.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
It's delicious.

03:08.200 --> 03:22.200
Okay, embarrassing first date.

03:23.200 --> 03:28.200
Yeah, I mean, I really don't feel sorry for this guy.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.200
Well, it happens to us.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.200
Sometimes we are in the company of a very beautiful girl.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.200
And we just get really nervous.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.200
All right.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.200
Well, I'm, you know, psychologist called this negative self-talk.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.200
Really?

03:40.200 --> 03:43.200
Yeah, this sort of calling yourself names and talking negatively about yourself.

03:43.200 --> 03:48.200
But actually, you can use some of this language to talk negatively about others.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
Yeah.

03:49.200 --> 03:54.200
I'm not going to be looking now at this language in language takeaway.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.200
Language takeaway.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.200
So on language takeaway today, we have five words.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.200
Let's start with our first one.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.200
Dumbass.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.200
Dumbass.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.200
Dumbass.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.200
Okay.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.200
Now, this is in a very polite word.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.200
I would say.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.200
Definitely not polite.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.200
Okay.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.200
But what is a dumbass?

04:11.200 --> 04:16.200
Well, it's obviously a dumb stupid idiot.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
Okay.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.200
So it's a person that is not very intelligent.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.200
And our next word is also quite similar.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
Moron.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
Moron.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.200
Moron.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.200
A moron.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.200
If a person is a dumbass or a person is a moron, what's the difference?

04:31.200 --> 04:38.200
Well, basically, a moron is someone who is not smart, who is very unintelligent.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.200
Okay.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.200
So they don't know what one plus one is.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.200
Okay.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.200
But a dumbass is a person who does stupid things.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.200
Okay.

04:46.200 --> 04:50.200
So maybe a dumbass, like you're planning a bank robbery and the dumbass forgets to bring

04:50.200 --> 04:51.200
the gun.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.200
Okay.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.200
That is a dumbass.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.200
So maybe Moron is a little bit less offensive.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.200
And it's actually, you'll find it in the dictionary, right?

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
Yeah.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.200
What is a dumbass?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.200
I don't think you'll find it.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
Yeah, it's slang.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
Exactly.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.200
Now, what about this next?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.200
It's also a negative name.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.200
You can call people a tool.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.200
Tool.

05:08.200 --> 05:14.200
This is very strange because I don't know how a tool can be something negative towards a person.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.200
Yeah.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.200
But it actually means the opposite, right?

05:16.200 --> 05:20.200
If a person is called a tool, it means they are useless, right?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.200
Yeah.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.200
So if you're ever called a tool, they're saying that you're useless.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.200
You're good for nothing.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.200
All right.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.200
Well, these are three interesting words.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.200
So why don't we hear some examples of each of these words in use?

05:32.200 --> 05:35.200
Example one.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
I hate Tom.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.200
He's such a dumbass.

05:38.200 --> 05:42.200
Last week, you borrowed my mobile phone and dropped it in the pool.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.200
Example two.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.200
I don't like Kevin very much.

05:48.200 --> 05:53.200
He can be a real moron at times.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.200
Example three.

05:56.200 --> 06:00.200
It was looking for a job, but he didn't even have a resume prepared.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.200
He's such a tool.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.200
Okay.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.200
So great examples.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.200
And here at EnglishPod.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.200
We're bringing you real street to talk.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.200
Exactly.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.200
Language as it is spoken by today's youth.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.200
Okay.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.200
Now let's take a look at our last two words.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.200
All right.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.200
Well, these phrases you can use when you're trying to calm yourself down and make yourself

06:21.200 --> 06:22.200
relax a little bit, right?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.200
Right.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.200
Let's take a look at the next one.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.200
Chill.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.200
Chill.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.200
Okay.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200
Chill.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.200
So again, relax.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.200
Calm down.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.200
Yeah.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.200
You need to chill.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.200
Yes.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.200
And then you also need to be cool.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.200
Be cool.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.200
Be cool.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.200
Now, if you can tell the pattern is related to temperature, right?

06:42.200 --> 06:43.200
No is cold.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.200
Cool is similar to cold.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.200
Yep.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.200
So again, that's what it means to relax.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.200
To calm down your emotions.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.200
Right.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.200
Make your emotions not so hot.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.200
Exactly.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.200
All right.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.200
So chill.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.200
Be cool.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.200
Exactly.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.200
And you use them together like that.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.200
Don't you?

06:58.200 --> 06:59.200
Yeah.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.200
Yeah.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.200
Now, chill also has another way of using it, right?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.200
Exactly.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
You can say, I'm chilling with my friends.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.200
Yeah.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.200
We're chilling here in the EnglishPod studio.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.200
Which means we're just relaxing.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.200
Yeah.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
We are just having fun.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.200
Yep.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.200
Not doing anything, right?

07:11.200 --> 07:12.200
Say chilling.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.200
You have to, you have to drop the G.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.200
Yeah.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.200
You have to drop.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.200
Right.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.200
You can say I'm chilling.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.200
Yeah.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.200
You have to say I'm chilling.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.200
I'm chilling.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
Okay.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.200
So that's all for language takeaway.

07:23.200 --> 07:27.440
But now, let's take a look at some of the really useful phrases that we saw in this

07:27.440 --> 07:30.200
dialogue in Fluency Builder.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.200
Fluency Builder.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.200
Okay.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.200
So this guy is so happy.

07:34.200 --> 07:39.200
He's on this date that he wants to scream at the top of his lungs.

07:39.200 --> 07:46.200
So basically, he just wants to scream to shout really loudly.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.200
Really loudly.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.200
Yeah.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.200
He's so excited, right?

07:49.200 --> 07:50.200
Exactly.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.200
Okay.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.200
So for example, sometimes you're at a concert, right?

07:53.200 --> 07:54.200
Yep.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.200
And you need to talk to your friend and you're like screaming at the top of your lungs

07:57.200 --> 07:59.200
because the other person can't hear you.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.200
Exactly.

08:00.200 --> 08:04.200
Or maybe you're lost in the woods and you need to scream at the top of your lungs so that someone

08:04.200 --> 08:05.200
will hear you and find you.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.200
Yeah.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.200
All right.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.200
Very good.

08:08.200 --> 08:13.200
So the name at the top of my lungs are next phrase.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.200
Get it together.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.200
Get it together.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.200
Get it together.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.200
So if I tell you, Erica, you need to get it together.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.200
Basically, you're telling me to calm down, relax.

08:22.200 --> 08:26.200
So pull your emotions together and get your idea straight.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.200
Right.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.200
So it kind of gives you this idea that you've got to pull, like you said, pull your emotions

08:31.200 --> 08:33.200
together in a little box and tie them up.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.200
All right.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.200
So get it together.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.200
Yep.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.200
So Marco, when would you use this phrase?

08:38.200 --> 08:39.200
Get it together.

08:39.200 --> 08:44.200
I guess when somebody is either very emotional, maybe crying or very nervous,

08:44.200 --> 08:46.200
you know, you tell the person, oh, get it together.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
Yeah.

08:47.200 --> 08:51.200
Or when somebody maybe is not doing something good in their life,

08:51.200 --> 08:54.200
you know, like making bad decisions or not being responsible.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.200
You tell that person, you need to get it together.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.200
Exactly.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.200
Right.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.200
Exactly.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.200
I couldn't have said it better myself.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.200
Okay.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.200
So now why don't we move on to our next phrase?

09:04.200 --> 09:06.200
And this is really, really high frequency.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.200
I think you would hear it all the time.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.200
All right.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
So what the hell?

09:10.200 --> 09:11.200
What the hell?

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
What the hell?

09:12.200 --> 09:14.200
So why would you say what the hell?

09:14.200 --> 09:16.200
Well, obviously you're asking a question, right?

09:16.200 --> 09:19.200
Because I got your, your W, you got your what?

09:19.200 --> 09:23.200
But when you say the hell, you're putting emphasis on the what?

09:23.200 --> 09:25.200
So you're asking a really strong question.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
Right.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.200
But it's not polite.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.200
Yep.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.200
Okay.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.200
So if I say what the hell is going on?

09:30.200 --> 09:31.200
Um, what's happening?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.200
Really, really what's happening.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.200
Yeah.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.200
So, and we can change it a little bit.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.200
We can replace the what?

09:37.200 --> 09:39.200
With another WH like why?

09:39.200 --> 09:40.200
How?

09:40.200 --> 09:41.200
How?

09:41.200 --> 09:42.200
Where?

09:42.200 --> 09:43.200
Where or when?

09:43.200 --> 09:44.200
Yeah.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.200
Okay.

09:45.200 --> 09:50.200
So why don't we hear some examples of how this expression is used using different WH words?

09:50.200 --> 09:52.200
Example one.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.200
Where the hell are you?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.200
I've been waiting for hours.

10:03.200 --> 10:08.200
Example two.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.200
How the hell did you do that?

10:10.200 --> 10:15.200
That was amazing.

10:15.200 --> 10:19.200
Example three.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.200
When the hell are you going to find a job?

10:21.200 --> 10:26.200
I'm tired of pay for everything.

10:26.200 --> 10:30.200
Example four.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.200
Who the hell are you?

10:31.200 --> 10:36.200
I don't know you.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.200
All right.

10:37.200 --> 10:41.200
Now our final word also a little bit strong.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.200
But pretty high frequency.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.200
Oh yeah.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.200
Very high frequency.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.200
Oh crap.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.200
Oh crap.

10:47.200 --> 10:53.200
So it's a little bit strong but less strong than maybe saying a really bad word, right?

10:53.200 --> 10:54.200
Yes.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.200
But it's definitely saying like you made a mistake, right?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.200
Yeah.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
It's like a really strong.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.200
Oh no.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.200
Exactly.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
Really strong.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
Oh no.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
But I guess not many people say oh no.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.200
Oh no.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.200
I just lost $10 million.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.200
Exactly right.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.200
You would not say that.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.200
Yeah.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.200
So it's a very strong.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.200
Oh no.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
But it's not as strong as it could be.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.200
There are other words out there that are stronger.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.200
But we are not going to go into them here.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.200
But maybe you guys know.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.200
So let us know.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.200
Yeah.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.200
We can definitely keep an eye out on the comment section.

11:23.200 --> 11:27.200
But don't write the words in the comment section.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.200
Okay.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.200
So we saw some really great phrases.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.200
Some really great words.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.200
A lot of informal language.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.200
But it's very high frequency and you'll use that with your friends or you'll see it in movies,

11:36.200 --> 11:37.200
TV shows.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.200
Yes.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.200
Really common in movies and in TV shows.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.200
Exactly.

11:40.200 --> 11:44.200
So let's listen to this dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk a little

11:44.200 --> 11:45.200
bit more.

11:45.200 --> 11:52.200
Nice.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.200
Your salad.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.200
Mmm.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.200
Looks good.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.200
And positively famished.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.200
And for you, sir.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.200
Thank you.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.200
Enjoy.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.200
Thank you.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.200
Thank you.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.200
I can't believe she's on a date with me.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.200
I'm so lucky.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.200
I must be the luckiest guy in the world.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.200
I want to scream and tell my lungs.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.200
I'm luckiest dude in the world.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.200
Oh, shut up.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.200
Don't be such a dumbass.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.200
She's so hot.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.200
Wait, I can't say that.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
Good sexist.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
She's so hot.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.200
She's making me sexist.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.200
Oh my god.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.200
I'm such a tool.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.200
Okay.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.200
Get it together.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.200
Oh, she's eating salad.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.200
All right.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.200
Never salad.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.200
No crap.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.200
Which fork do I use?

12:37.200 --> 12:38.200
Damn it.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.200
She's going to think I'm a moron.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.200
What the hell are all these sports for?

12:42.200 --> 12:43.200
Which one did she use?

12:43.200 --> 12:44.200
Okay, chill.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
You're all.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.200
You're all.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
Just take a fork.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.200
Eat your salad.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.200
Um...

12:52.200 --> 12:53.200
Hmm.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.200
Hmm.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.200
Oh, sorry.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.200
What were you saying?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.200
You're eating my salad.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.200
Oh, yes.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
It's delicious.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.200
So these slang words, they're actually very common, right?

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
Yeah.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.200
I think like you said, it's not likely that you'll find them in a dictionary.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.200
Um...

13:23.200 --> 13:24.200
Of course.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.200
And you can find them in movies or sometimes when you're having a conversation in a very

13:26.200 --> 13:28.200
informal conversation with a native speaker.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.200
Yep.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.200
These words will slip out and these slang terms will come up.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
Exactly.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.200
And you know what?

13:33.200 --> 13:39.200
There's a great resource out there for wonderful English slang terms called UrbanDictionary.com.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.200
Exactly.

13:40.200 --> 13:44.200
And if you ever see a word that maybe you can find in the conventional dictionary, you're

13:44.200 --> 13:45.200
probably going to find it there.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.200
Yeah, we'll put a link up to it on the site.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
All right.

13:48.200 --> 13:53.200
So also, if you have any questions or comments, be sure to come to our website EnglishPod.com.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.200

And we also've got lots of resources, like links to UrbanDictionary.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.200
Right.

And also, if you have any questions on any other slang terms that you may have heard or how to use them, be sure to post it on the comments section.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.200
Well, guys.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.200
Bye-bye.
