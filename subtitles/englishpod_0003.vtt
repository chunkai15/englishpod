00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm Amira.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
Amira and I are here today with an interesting lesson about a hotel situation.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Amira, why don't you give us a little bit more information?

00:17.000 --> 00:26.000
Well, the situation is taking place in a hotel and someone is checking in and is obtaining an upgrade.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
An upgrade?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Okay, that's an interesting word.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all this vocabulary.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Good afternoon.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
What can I do for you?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I'd like to check in, please.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
I have a reservation under the name Anthony Roberts.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
All right, Robert.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Oh, Mr. Roberts, we've been expecting you.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
And here is your key card to the presidential suite.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
But there must be some mistake.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
My reservation was for a standard room.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Are you sure?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Let me double check.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, here.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
This is my confirmation number.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
You're right, Mr. Roberts.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
There seems to be a mix-up.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Unfortunately, we're overbooked at the moment.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
So...

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Not to worry.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
We're pleased to offer you a complimentary upgrade.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Woohoo!

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Presidential suite, baby!

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Okay, everyone.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
That is nice, huh?

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah, the guy is really excited that he's going to get the presidential suite.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Yes, there are some interesting phrases and vocabulary items here.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
And I know, Marco, you want to talk about some of them.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Right.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
The first one, and this is really useful for all of our listeners who travel a lot.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
This phrase will come in handy.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
And it is, I have a reservation under the name.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Under the name.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Under the name.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Under the name.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
So before we explain this phrase, let's listen to some examples on how it is used in other situations.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And then we'll come back and give you more information.

02:19.000 --> 02:29.000
My secretary made a reservation under my name.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm sorry, sir.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I don't have a reservation under that name.

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
Do you have a reservation under the name Smith?

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
Alright, some really good examples there on how we could use this phrase in other situations.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
But just in case, let me explain it real fast.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
Under the name means that when you go to the restaurant or a hotel and you tell them your name,

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
they know that you are the person that they have been expecting.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
They have been waiting.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yes.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Well, I have chosen another useful phrase for you, and it is mix up.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Mix up.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Mix up.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Mix up.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
There seems to be a mix up.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
Before we talk about this phrase, let's listen to some examples of how it is used.

03:26.000 --> 03:41.000
There was a mix up at the airport and my bags were sent to Antarctica.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm sorry, sir.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
There's been a terrible mix up with giving you the wrong baby.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
Okay, that was useful and funny.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah, that's the baby situation.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Oh, my God.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Imagine that happening.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah, I know.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
Well, guys, so a mix up is a confusion or a misunderstanding.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Exactly.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Well put.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Alright, Marco.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
What do you have for us?

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Okay, the next word that you should take a look at is overbooked.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Overbooked.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Overbooked.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Overbooked.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Overbooked.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
What does that mean?

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
So if a hotel or a flight is overbooked, it means that they are full.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
They are more than full.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Right, so they cannot accept any more people.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Exactly.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Okay, now why is this phrase useful?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Because it happens all the time.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
There's so many other situations where you can use this word or hear it from other native English speakers.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
For example, a bus or a train can be overbooked.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Exactly, that's really common.

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
Okay, let's take a look at the last phrase for today and that is complementary upgrade.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Complementary upgrade.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Complementary upgrade.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Complementary upgrade.

05:14.000 --> 05:23.000
So this means that, for example, when the hotel is overbooked and all of their standard rooms are full,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
they will give you a better room, a more expensive room, but free.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Yes, because it was not your fault.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Right, this also happens sometimes if you're lucky on airplane flights.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yes.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
So if you are an economy class and an airplane, but for some reason it's overbooked,

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
they will move you to business class or first class for free.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I have a similar story, but I'm not going to tell you about it now.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
For now, let's go and listen to the dialogue one more time and when we come back, we'll talk some more.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Good afternoon.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
What can I do for you?

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
I'd like to check in, please. I have a reservation under the name Anthony Roberts.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
All right, Robert.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
Oh, Mr. Roberts, we've been expecting you and here is your key card to the presidential suite.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
But there must be some mistake. My reservation was for a standard room.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Are you sure? Let me double check.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah, here, this is my confirmation number.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
You're right, Mr. Roberts. There seems to be a mix-up.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Unfortunately, we're overbooked at the moment.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
So...

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Not to worry. We're pleased to offer you a complimentary upgrade.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Woohoo!

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Presidential suite, baby.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
I love listening to this dialogue. It's just so nice to see that someone is enjoying.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
His upgrade so much, huh?

07:05.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, especially since he was expecting just a really normal room and now he's going to be treated like a king.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
So, Marco, have you ever gotten a complimentary upgrade?

07:16.000 --> 07:24.000
Yes, yes, I did. When I was traveling through India, I bought a normal seat in the train.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
But, for some reason, it was overbooked.

07:28.000 --> 07:36.000
So, I talked to the station manager and I got a complimentary upgrade to first class.

07:36.000 --> 07:44.000
I had a similar experience as well. I was flying from Shanghai to Qatar and I actually had an economy seat.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
But for some reason, they just upgraded me and I was so happy.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Oh, really? Like, it wasn't overbooked.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
Well, I'm not sure because normally the night flight is not that full, but they upgraded me for some reason.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
And I was so happy. It was an upgrade to first class.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Wow, that's really cool.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
I would prefer a first class upgrade on an airplane, yeah, any day.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
Well, you know what? Really amazed me was like, the food you get there. You know, you have a five-course meal.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Oh, really?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yes.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
And you get all the drinks you can get, right?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Exactly.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Oh, that would be really happy there.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
All right, everyone. We're at a time today, but be sure to listen tomorrow because we'll be back again with another great podcast.

08:29.000 --> 08:38.000
And also, don't forget to go to our website at englishpod.com and leave us all your questions and comments in our community forum.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000

And I hope you enjoyed the lesson today, and Marko and I will be back tomorrow with another great lesson for you.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
But for now, it's bye.
