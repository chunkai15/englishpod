Hello English nerds, welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:06.720 --> 00:12.960
And I'm Erica. And today we're going to be looking at English slang and informal words used

00:12.960 --> 00:21.440
in the 1980s. So this is the next part of our decades dialogues. Exactly. So the 1980s

00:21.440 --> 00:27.040
may be for many of our listeners is a little bit more familiar and there are a lot of phrases

00:27.120 --> 00:32.480
and a lot of words that were born in this decade and we still use them today. So we're going to

00:32.480 --> 00:38.160
learn those words and phrases in this dialogue. But before we start we need to preview a couple of

00:38.160 --> 00:44.640
words. So let's go now to vocabulary preview. Very vocabulary preview. So one of the words that we're

00:44.640 --> 00:52.560
going to hear in our dialogue is ride. Is that your ride? Is that your ride? So all right, normally we

00:52.720 --> 01:00.000
know this word as a verb, right? Right to ride a bicycle. In this context it's an informal way

01:00.000 --> 01:07.200
of referring to your car. So a ride is a car. Yeah, so I just bought a new ride. All right, well,

01:07.200 --> 01:13.440
maybe you'll take me for a ride and you're a new ride. And we're also going to be looking at

01:13.440 --> 01:21.600
this word loaded. He's loaded. So if you are loaded, you're really rich. You have a lot of money.

01:21.680 --> 01:28.000
Yeah, we're loaded with money. So loaded and ride. Those are two words for vocabulary preview.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.560
And well, let's listen to our 1980s dialogue and see what happens.

01:41.360 --> 01:46.960
Jim, what's up, man? Charlie, is that your ride? It's what ugly dude?

01:47.920 --> 01:54.240
Don't be an airhead. This is a 1969 Chevy Impala. I just need to fix it up a bit.

01:54.240 --> 02:00.960
In a couple of months, this baby is going to be wicked. Not even. Check it out. Now that's a fresh ride.

02:01.520 --> 02:06.160
See about the driver's a major dweave. Anyway, we can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like

02:06.160 --> 02:16.320
his. He's coming this way. Be cool. Hey, guys, what do you think of my automobile? Isn't it bad to

02:16.800 --> 02:22.560
word? The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

02:22.560 --> 02:28.640
You really think so. For sure. Awesome. Psych. You totally fell for it.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.080
You're a real scumbad Charlie. When I do the nasty with the prom queen,

02:32.080 --> 02:35.120
we'll see who has a last laugh. Dude, don't have a cow.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.360
All right, so typical high school students of the decade, right?

02:44.000 --> 02:49.600
Definitely very, very 80s. Very 80s. And well, of course, you always have the situation with the cool

02:49.600 --> 02:54.640
kid and maybe the the kids that are not so cool and well, they're making fun of him, right?

02:54.640 --> 02:59.280
Yeah, but they use some really cool words. So let's look at them now in language takeaway.

03:00.880 --> 03:06.880
Language takeaway. All right. So the first word that we saw in language takeaway and was really

03:06.880 --> 03:14.960
interesting this word but ugly. It's but ugly. That car is but ugly. So when something is but ugly,

03:14.960 --> 03:20.560
it's really ugly, right? It's very ugly. It's not just ugly. It's very ugly. And what

03:20.560 --> 03:26.160
would but is like from your your bottom? From your bottom, yeah? Yeah. So he said the car was

03:26.160 --> 03:32.720
but ugly and the other guy answered by saying, hey, don't be an airhead. An airhead. Don't be an

03:32.720 --> 03:39.520
airhead. So an airhead is someone with air in their head. And they're head. So they're not very smart.

03:39.520 --> 03:45.200
They've got no brain. They've got no brain. So he said don't be an airhead. Don't be such an idiot.

03:45.200 --> 03:52.240
Mm-hmm. All right. Now for the third word, he described his car as being wicked.

03:52.880 --> 03:59.920
It's wicked. That's wicked. It's going to be wicked. Okay, so this is a very 80s way of saying

03:59.920 --> 04:05.600
it's going to be cool. Yep. It's going to be awesome. It's going to be wicked. All right. And now when

04:05.600 --> 04:13.120
they saw another car pulling up a new car, he described it as a fresh ride. It's a fresh ride.

04:13.120 --> 04:19.120
Now we understand that ride is a car, right? Mm-hmm. So a fresh ride. It's another way of saying cool.

04:19.120 --> 04:24.400
Okay, so kind of similar wicked and fresh. Yeah. Now finally the end of our dialogue,

04:24.400 --> 04:31.200
they said, you're a real scumbag, Charlie. So this word scumbag is interesting. You're a scumbag.

04:31.200 --> 04:37.360
A scumbag. Yeah, it's interesting and it's still used today, I would say. Yep. So when someone

04:37.360 --> 04:43.040
is a scumbag, they're just really not a nice person. Yeah, they're not nice or they're not maybe

04:43.040 --> 04:49.440
to a certain point honest. They're not kind. Exactly. You're a scumbag. Mm-hmm. Okay, but it's not a

04:49.440 --> 04:54.160
very harsh word, right? It's not harsh to say, call somebody a scumbag? Well, it's not like

04:54.160 --> 04:59.040
a swear word, but it's certainly not a nice thing to say to someone. Okay, exactly. All right,

04:59.040 --> 05:04.640
so let's listen to all these adjectives that we've just looked at right now. Again, in our dialogue,

05:04.640 --> 05:07.200
and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

05:12.080 --> 05:23.360
Jim, what's up, man? Charlie, is that your ride? It's but ugly, dude. Don't be an airhead. This is

05:23.360 --> 05:31.600
1969 Chevy Impala. I just need to fix it up a bit. In a couple of months, this baby's going to be wicked.

05:32.800 --> 05:39.440
Not even. Check it out. Now that's a fresh ride. Hmm, too bad, the driver is a major

05:39.440 --> 05:46.000
dweeb. Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his. He's coming this way.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.800
Be cool. Hey guys, what do you think of my automobile? Isn't it bad to the bone?

05:50.800 --> 05:54.880
Word, the ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around

05:54.880 --> 06:02.000
in that car. You really think so? For sure. Awesome. Psych, you totally fell for it.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.640
You are a real scumbag, Charlie. When I do the nasty with the prom queen,

06:06.640 --> 06:10.160
we'll see who has the last laugh. Dude, don't have a cow.

06:13.520 --> 06:18.480
Okay, well, you know what, Marco? I love the 80s. I love the language of the 80s. I love the music of the

06:19.040 --> 06:25.120
80s and I'm really loving these phrases from the 80s. So why don't we look at them now in fluency

06:25.120 --> 06:32.240
builder? Fluency builder. All right, so I'm fluency builder today. Let's take a look at these phrases

06:32.240 --> 06:36.960
that you were talking about. And the first one is very interesting. So these two guys that were

06:36.960 --> 06:44.560
making fun of this other person that was in this nice car, and he called him a major dweeb. A major dweeb.

06:44.720 --> 06:49.680
He's a major dweeb. What a major dweeb. Now let's break this into two parts first.

06:50.560 --> 06:57.600
Well, let's see what dweeb means. Well, a dweeb is a very uncool person. Okay, so kind of similar to a nerd.

06:57.600 --> 07:03.920
Yeah, a small kind of guy with no power. Okay, he's a dweeb. Now this word major.

07:04.480 --> 07:10.480
It just means big, really serious. So it's a way of emphasizing, right? Yeah, and you can say

07:10.480 --> 07:16.240
anything, you can have a major anything. Like, I've got a major headache. All right, I can say I have

07:16.240 --> 07:22.480
a major problem this week. Okay, so major, a very big problem. Yep. Now they're talking about this

07:22.480 --> 07:30.560
really cool car. And the guy who is a bit of a dweeb, he said, isn't it bad to the bone? Bad to the bone?

07:30.560 --> 07:37.120
It's bad to the bone. All right, now this is also part of a famous song, bad to the bone. But what does

07:37.200 --> 07:43.360
it mean? Well, when something is bad to the bone, it's super cool. It's like it's so dangerous that

07:43.360 --> 07:50.400
it's cool. Exactly. It's very, very cool. It's bad to the bone. Now this is not used anymore.

07:50.400 --> 07:55.920
No, no, don't walk out of your house and use this phrase tomorrow. All right, so, but it's interesting

07:55.920 --> 08:01.440
to know because there is a famous song that has this phrase in it so bad to the bone. All right,

08:01.440 --> 08:06.960
so the car was so cool. It was bad to the bone that all of the ladies would be wanting to

08:07.040 --> 08:14.240
get with the driver. All right, so somebody wants to get with you. He just wants to get with you.

08:14.240 --> 08:18.560
So if you want to get with someone, you want to have sex with them. Right, so if you want to get

08:18.560 --> 08:23.760
with someone, basically, it means that you want to have sex with them. But there's another phrase

08:23.760 --> 08:29.040
that was used in the dial. That means pretty much the same thing. Yeah, to do the nasty.

08:29.040 --> 08:35.520
To do the nasty. They're doing the nasty. Okay, now this was a very popular way of saying it in the

08:35.520 --> 08:40.320
80s. It means to have sex as well. Yeah, but this one is a little bit rude, isn't it?

08:40.320 --> 08:44.720
Yeah, I think it's a little bit more direct. Yeah, if you and your friends are talking and you say,

08:44.720 --> 08:51.600
hey, I think that girl wants to get with you. It's a little bit more casual and less obvious.

08:51.600 --> 08:57.600
Yeah, yes, do the nasty is a little bit more a little more rude. Yeah, a little bit more direct.

08:57.600 --> 09:02.400
Yeah, and now the last phrase that we're going to look at today was May Famous by the

09:02.400 --> 09:08.160
cartoons, the Simpsons. And it's don't have a cow. Don't have a cow. Don't have a cow.

09:08.160 --> 09:15.920
So to not have a cow, don't have a cow means to get really angry, to freak out, to get upset.

09:15.920 --> 09:20.960
All right, so now we know that you say don't have a cow, but can I say it and use it in the

09:20.960 --> 09:26.480
positive? Can I say, hey, my boss totally had a cow today in the office? Yeah, and it means again.

09:26.480 --> 09:31.200
So it freaked out. Got angry. Made a big deal of something. Okay, he had a cow.

09:31.280 --> 09:36.640
Yeah, so Frank's going to have a cow when he finds out I smashed his car. Of course, Frank is going to

09:36.640 --> 09:42.480
have a cow. How can you smash his car? All right, but now it's time for us to listen to this

09:42.480 --> 09:47.280
dialogue for the last time. And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this decade of the

09:47.760 --> 09:49.760
1980s.

09:57.440 --> 10:03.040
Jim, what's up, man? Charlie, is that your ride? It's what ugly dude?

10:04.320 --> 10:10.320
Don't be an airhead. This is a 1969 Chevy Impala. I just need to fix it up a bit.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.960
In a couple of months, this baby is going to be wicked.

10:13.280 --> 10:19.040
Not even. Check it out. Now, that's a fresh ride. Well, too bad, the driver's a major

10:19.040 --> 10:23.760
dweeb. Anyway, we can have a car like that if the daddy's loaded like his. He's coming this way,

10:23.760 --> 10:32.960
be cool. Hey, guys, what do you think of my automobile? Isn't it bad to the bone?

10:32.960 --> 10:38.160
Word, the ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that

10:38.160 --> 10:42.160
car. You really think so. For sure. Awesome.

10:42.160 --> 10:47.520
Psych. You totally fell for it. You're a real skumbat, Charlie. When I do the nasty with the

10:47.520 --> 10:51.200
prom queen, we'll see who has a last laugh. Dude, don't have a cow.

10:56.400 --> 11:00.480
Okay, it's so marco. When I was listening to the dialogue this time, I heard a really cool word.

11:01.040 --> 11:06.960
They said, psych. Right. Now, this was a very popular thing during the 80s

11:07.040 --> 11:13.840
when you would say to somebody, psych. So this is like saying, just kidding, right? So you would say,

11:13.840 --> 11:18.000
oh, Eric, I really like your hat. Oh, thank you. Psych, that hat is terrible.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.320
Right. So that's how you would use it. You would give somebody a compliment or you would lie to somebody.

11:24.320 --> 11:29.120
Yeah. And then tell them psych and then like tell them the truth. Like, oh, that had a terrible

11:29.120 --> 11:36.720
or I was just kidding. Okay. So psych, what a great phrase. It was very very popular. And when I was

11:36.720 --> 11:41.920
in school, we would use it as well. We would psych each other out. So do we still use this phrase today?

11:41.920 --> 11:45.840
I don't think we use it today. I don't think it's cool anymore. Well, if you use it, it's kind of like

11:45.840 --> 11:50.480
you're joking, right? Yeah. And I think it would make people laugh. Like, you know, that's pretty funny.

11:50.480 --> 11:56.080
Yeah, you're joking about how you're a little bit old fashioned. Exactly. Yeah. I'm very sure you

11:56.080 --> 12:00.960
would surprise a lot of your native English speaking friends if you use this phrase. Mm, a good one to

12:00.960 --> 12:05.760
try out. Now, if you have any questions about this phrase or any other of the language,
