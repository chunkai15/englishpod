Hello English learners. Welcome back to English Pod. My name is Marco and I'm

00:05.240 --> 00:09.080
Erica and today we're going back to the movies. That's right. We've got a

00:09.080 --> 00:13.240
great lesson today and I really excited about this dialogue. I think it's

00:13.240 --> 00:19.040
fantastic. We have an original English pod production of a movie trailer. So

00:19.040 --> 00:23.480
what is a movie trailer? Well whenever you go to the cinema before the

00:23.480 --> 00:28.160
movie starts you have previews of upcoming movies. So like almost an

00:28.160 --> 00:33.040
advertisement for a future movie. Exactly. Okay. So that's a movie trailer and

00:33.040 --> 00:36.240
that's what we're bringing you today. A lot of great language you'll

00:36.240 --> 00:41.560
commonly hear in action movies. Right so let's start with vocabulary preview.

00:41.560 --> 00:49.300
Very cablory preview. We have one word today. Possess. Possess. Possess.

00:49.300 --> 00:54.600
So when you possess something you have it. Uh-huh. It's in your possession.

00:54.760 --> 00:59.000
Simple. You have it right? Yep. So when this dialogue our actors possess

00:59.000 --> 01:03.560
something very important. So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and

01:03.560 --> 01:07.560
it's going to be a little bit fast and a little bit difficult to understand.

01:07.560 --> 01:11.560
But don't worry. We'll come back and explain all of the key language later.

01:25.560 --> 01:30.680
In a digital world even the strongest must fight for survival.

01:35.480 --> 01:43.960
Two people possess a secret so valuable. So powerful. They have to defend it at all costs.

01:44.920 --> 01:51.160
I don't care where they are. I don't care what it takes. You find them and bring them to me!

01:52.120 --> 01:57.240
They only had one chance. And their chance was to fight back.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.120
To my new friend.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.480
With a little help from the governor.

02:15.160 --> 02:18.600
This is me. We have to get to the all of them. No matter what.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.360
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

02:23.480 --> 02:29.720
Double the action. Get down! Triple the excitement. Get down again!

02:31.160 --> 02:34.200
This summer nothing will stand in their way.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.920
I want to make them an offric out of me.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.200
I want to make them an offric out of me.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.200
Team hosts one podcast.

02:52.360 --> 02:55.240
English pod coming to a theater near you.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.600
Wow. So it sounds like a really good movie.

03:02.600 --> 03:06.280
I know when's it coming out? I think in 2015.

03:06.280 --> 03:11.160
Okay. I'll put that in my calendar. Okay. Let's take a look at the vocabulary we saw in this

03:11.160 --> 03:20.520
dialogue in language takeaway. Language takeaway today. We have three words. What's our first one?

03:20.520 --> 03:31.400
Survival. Survival. Survival. Survival is continuing to live even in really hard times.

03:31.400 --> 03:38.360
It comes from the verb to survive. Right? So survival is the noun form. Right. So maybe you are

03:38.360 --> 03:45.160
lost in the jungle. The jungle and you have to fight or survival. Right. You have to try to survive.

03:46.040 --> 03:54.440
Okay. Our next word. Defend. Defend. Defend. Defend. So let's listen to some examples of

03:54.520 --> 04:03.080
defend so you can understand the meaning. Example one. We have to defend the castle.

04:03.080 --> 04:09.080
The army is trying to kill the king. Example two.

04:12.280 --> 04:15.000
The soldiers defended the base in a difficult battle.

04:15.960 --> 04:26.520
Example three. These new machine guns will defend us.

04:28.920 --> 04:33.640
So basically it's to protect, right? Right. To protect from something that is really harmful.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.800
Okay. So you would defend your children. Uh-huh. You would defend your

04:38.280 --> 04:45.560
your house. Your house. For your castle. Your dog. Your cat. Yep. Okay. And our last word on language

04:45.560 --> 04:55.160
takeaway. Rough. Rough. Rough. Our OU GH. Rough. Right. It's got that. Uh-huh. Yep. Sound. Uh-huh.

04:55.800 --> 05:01.960
So it basically means so when something it's rough it's a little bit violent and hard. Hard. Yeah.

05:01.960 --> 05:08.280
For example boxing is a rough sport. Or hockey is also a rough sport. Exactly. So you have rough

05:08.280 --> 05:14.280
sports or maybe even a person can be a little bit rough. Yes. Or that person can play rough.

05:14.280 --> 05:20.440
Play rough exactly. Mm-hmm. So rough. Okay. So we're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

05:20.440 --> 05:25.960
And this time it'll be a little bit slower. So you can understand the language a little bit more clearly.

05:32.440 --> 05:37.080
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

05:38.920 --> 05:47.240
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful. They have to defend it at all costs.

05:48.120 --> 05:54.760
I don't care where they are. I don't care what it takes. You find them and bring them to me!

05:54.760 --> 06:00.920
Hey! They only had one chance and their chance was to fight back.

06:02.760 --> 06:06.920
Okay. You want to play rough? Say hello to my little friend!

06:08.120 --> 06:10.120
With a little help from the governor.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.560
Listen to me. We have to get them out of there. No matter what!

06:16.760 --> 06:21.880
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job. Double the action. Get down!

06:22.840 --> 06:25.560
Triple the excitement. Get down again!

06:27.000 --> 06:29.960
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.800
I'm gonna make him an offer. He can't refuse.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.840
Two hosts, one podcasts.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.080
English pod. Coming to a theater near you.

06:44.680 --> 06:49.320
So we saw some interesting phrases in this dialogue. Let's take a look at them in fluency builder.

06:50.200 --> 06:56.280
Fluency builder. The first phrase that we saw at all costs. At all costs.

06:56.280 --> 07:03.560
At all costs. At all costs. So let's listen to some examples before we explain at all costs.

07:04.520 --> 07:09.720
Example one. I'll protect my kids' old costs.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.360
Example two.

07:14.920 --> 07:20.920
We have to get this project done at all costs.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.760
Example three.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.600
You find those criminals at all costs.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.800
Well, if you're going to protect your kids at all costs,

07:39.800 --> 07:43.400
you're going to protect them even if it's really hard.

07:43.400 --> 07:48.280
Right. It doesn't matter how hard it is or what you have to do.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.160
Exactly. You'll do it at all costs.

07:52.120 --> 07:58.280
Now let's take a look at our second phrase for fluency builder and it's very similar to

07:58.280 --> 08:05.320
at all costs. Yeah, really similar. No matter what. No matter what. No matter what.

08:05.320 --> 08:10.520
For example, I'm going to go on vacation no matter what my boss says.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.960
Nothing's going to stop you. Right. If he says no, I'm still going on vacation.

08:13.960 --> 08:18.920
And I'm going to protect my kids no matter what. Exactly. No matter what. I don't have kids though.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.920
But you will protect them no matter what. If I had them.

08:24.760 --> 08:35.480
Okay. And our last phrase. Stand in their way. Stand in their way. Stand in their way.

08:36.360 --> 08:43.320
So let's listen to some examples of stand in someone's way and then we'll come back and explain it.

08:45.320 --> 08:51.240
Example one. Don't let anything stand in the way of your goals.

08:55.960 --> 09:03.400
Example two. I'm going to find that guy and nothing is going to stand in my way.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.760
Example three.

09:12.360 --> 09:16.440
I don't care what happens. I'm going to get that money and you better not stand in my way.

09:21.560 --> 09:27.240
So when something stands in your way, it's it's preventing you from reaching your goal. From reaching

09:27.240 --> 09:32.360
your goal, right? But we can also have somebody standing in your way physically. Like really

09:32.440 --> 09:37.480
you're standing close to me and I can't pass through the door. Right. So maybe the person is

09:37.480 --> 09:42.680
at the door and it's standing in my way. I can't go in. Yeah. Okay. But here we're not really talking

09:42.680 --> 09:47.560
about a real thing, right? That you can touch. Right. It's more of some obstacle that's preventing

09:47.560 --> 09:52.040
you from reaching your goals or from doing what you want to do. Yeah. So now we can listen to our

09:52.040 --> 09:55.720
dialogue again. And now you can understand these words that we've just talked about.

10:02.600 --> 10:15.640
Look. In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

10:20.680 --> 10:29.160
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful. They have to defend it at all costs.

10:30.120 --> 10:36.280
I don't care where they are. I don't care what it takes. You find them. And bring them to me.

10:37.480 --> 10:42.440
They only had one chance and their chance was to fight back.

10:42.440 --> 10:48.440
You want to play with them? You want to play with them?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.440
You want to play with them? You want to play with them?

10:56.440 --> 11:02.440
With a little help from the governor. Listen to me, if we have to get to the all of them,

11:02.440 --> 11:10.440
go back to what? Nothing will prevent them from doing their job. Double the action. Get down!

11:10.440 --> 11:19.400
Get down! Triple the excitement. Get down again! This summer nothing will stand in their way.

11:22.200 --> 11:25.400
I want to make them all overcome with you.

11:25.400 --> 11:51.880
I know that you're a big movie fan, right? Yeah, I'm a big movie fan. I usually watch maybe

11:51.880 --> 11:58.520
three or five movies a week. Really? Many students of English like to watch movies is a way to

11:58.520 --> 12:04.760
improve their English. That's one of the best ways to learn English is through songs and movies.

12:04.760 --> 12:09.160
What do you think are some useful movies that people can watch to practice English?

12:09.160 --> 12:13.480
Well, I would recommend children's movies. Really? Yeah, they have simple vocabulary,

12:13.480 --> 12:19.640
but they have very common language. And also what's happening in the movie is very easy to understand

12:20.520 --> 12:26.280
so you can see the action and hear the word. Exactly. So if you like to watch movies,

12:26.280 --> 12:33.160
ran to DVD or go via DVD, watch it in the original language with English subtitles.

12:33.160 --> 12:38.520
So you should watch it in English. With English subtitles. Yeah, and what are subtitles?

12:39.000 --> 12:43.640
Subtitles are the words that you see at the bottom of the screen that translate. Okay, what

12:43.640 --> 12:48.280
the people are saying. Okay. Yeah, that's the best thing to do. Try that exercise. If you have a

12:48.280 --> 12:51.960
pen and paper with you, it's much better. You can pause the movie right down the word you

12:51.960 --> 12:57.640
don't understand and then maybe review it later. That's a really good tip. I always tell my students

12:57.640 --> 13:04.040
that they should watch movies, listen to music, read the newspaper, and write down at least five

13:04.040 --> 13:09.080
new words or phrases a week. Yeah, yeah, it's a really good exercise and you'll improve a lot.

13:09.080 --> 13:14.200
Yes. So everyone, we want you to go out and watch a movie in English. Turn on the subtitles

13:14.200 --> 13:20.200
and write down some new vocabulary. Exactly. And if you have any comments or questions or maybe

13:20.200 --> 13:25.560
even suggestions, you can come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave them in our community

13:25.560 --> 13:31.400

13:31.400 --> 13:36.680
and what movies you're watching. Exactly. So we're out of time today. We'll see you guys next time

13:36.680 --> 13:46.680
until then. It's goodbye.
