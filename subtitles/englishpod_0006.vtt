00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
How are you, Erica?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Marco, I'm doing really well. How about you?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
I'm doing great. I'm really excited because today we're talking about travel.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
That's right. We're going to give you some real English to talk about travel.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Exactly English that you would use in everyday life that you hear in movies and TV shows.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
English people actually use.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Exactly. So why don't you tell us a little bit about this lesson for today?

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
Okay, so today we are going to listen as a husband and wife get ready to go on a trip.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Alright, that sounds a little bit complicated.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Uh-huh. Well, let's look at our two preview words.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Vocabulary preview.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Okay, so the first word that we have is roadtrip.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Roadtrip. Roadtrip. Roadtrip.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay, so roadtrips are really fun and interesting, right?

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
Roadtrips are great. You get to get in a car with your family and drive on a vacation.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, that was a really fun and the really popular in North America.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Really popular. I've been on a million roadtrips.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Alright, we'll talk about that a little bit later on.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
But now let's take a look at our second word and it's the cars packed.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
The cars packed.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
The cars packed.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
The car is packed.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
So when your car is packed, it means that everything you need is inside the car.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Alright, so your bags, your food, everything that you need for your trip.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Exactly.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
Perfect. Okay, so those were our two preview words and now we are ready to listen to the dialogue for the first time.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay, this dialogue will be at normal speed. It will be fast.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
But don't worry if you don't understand everything.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
After 10 minutes, we promise you will understand everything in this lesson.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
So, are we all ready to go?

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Yep, I think so. The cars packed. We have munchies and music and the maps and the car.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Did you get the camera?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Got it. Did you fill up the tank?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Yep, it's all set.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
You're sure we're not forgetting anything.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm sure we've got all our bases covered.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Well, let's get going then. I love road trips.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Hmm, do you think we can make a pit stop?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Well, she forgot to go to the bathroom.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah, I hate it when this happens.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
This happens to me on almost every road trip.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Okay, great. So now it's time for our language takeaway.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
We have three words for our language takeaway today.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Language takeaway.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And the first word is munchies.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Munchies.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Munchies.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
So munchies are snacks.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Snacks, food, food, chips, chips, cookies, chocolate bars.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh, that good stuff.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I love munchies.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
And they're really good when you're taking a road trip.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Indeed.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Okay, so let's take a look at our second language takeaway word for today.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
And it is fill up the tank.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Fill up the tank.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Fill up the tank.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
So this is to put gas in your car.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Put gas in the gas tank.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
In the gas tank, exactly.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
All right, our last language takeaway today is...

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Pit stop.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Pit stop.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Pit stop.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Make a pit stop.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
It's a quick stop for you to get some gas, food, go to the bathroom.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah, a pit stop, a quick stop.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Great. So now it's time for putting it together.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
Okay, so we have two great phrases for you today.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Let's take a look at the first one.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
We've got all our bases covered.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
We've got all our bases covered.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
We've got all our bases covered.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
This is a really great phrase and it's really useful, right?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, let's listen to a couple of examples.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Example one.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
We've got all our bases covered in case the hurricane hits.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Example two.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Okay, I have my keys, wallet, and passport.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Looks like I have all my bases covered.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Okay, it's clear now, but you can use this in a lot of different situations, right?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
You can use this in many situations.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
If I'm at work, I could say...

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
All right, we've got a really good marketing plan.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
We've got all our bases covered.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Exactly. You have everything ready.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You're all prepared.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Perfect. All right.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Now let's take a look at our second phrase and it's...

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Let's get going.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Let's get going.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Let's get going.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Let's get going.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
All right, so when you say let's get going, it just means...

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Let's start.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Let's start. Let's go.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
Okay, but the interesting thing about this phrase is you can change it a little bit

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
and it means something different.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Uh-huh. Let's listen to a couple of examples.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Example 1.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
I have the chicken, so let's get cooking.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Example 2.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
This house is really scary.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Let's get out of here.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Example 3.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
I have another meeting in 20 minutes, so let's get down to business.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
So let's get down to business, Marco.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Let's get down to business.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Let's listen to the dialogue one more time, but this time...

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
It'll be a little bit slower and you'll understand much better.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
So are we all ready to go?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Yep. I think so.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
The cars packed. We have munchies and music and the maps in the car.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Did you get the camera?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Got it.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Did you fill up the tank?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Yep, it's all set.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
You're sure we're not forgetting anything.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I'm sure we've got all our bases covered.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, let's get going then.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I love road trips.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Um, do you think we can make a pit stop?

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
So that was a little more clear this time, wasn't it?

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah, you can definitely understand better about what we've been talking about.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yep.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay, so now it's time to look at Fluency Builder.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Erica, why don't you explain what Fluency Builder is?

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
In Fluency Builder, we give you some great, useful phrases to help you express your ideas clearly.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Okay, great. So let's look at Fluency Builder.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Fluency Builder.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
All right, so we all know how to ask the question.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Are we ready to go?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
That's right. You can say, can we go now?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Or you can say, are we ready to go?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Exactly.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
But there's another way that we can say this and we heard it in our dialogue.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
So let's listen.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
So, are we all ready to go?

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
So, are we all ready to go?

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Wow, that sounds really good. It sounds a lot more.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Fluent.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Fluent, exactly.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah. Okay, so another simple phrase that we all know how to say is, it is ready.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
It is prepared.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
It is ready.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Right.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
So these examples are fine. They're right.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah, they're correct English, no problem.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
But there's another way to say this that we heard in the dialogue and it sounds a lot more fluent.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Yep, it's all set.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Yep, it's all set.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
It's all set. That sounds much better.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Yes, and we're all set to listen to this dialogue for a third time.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And this time it's going to be at its normal speed.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
So, are we all ready to go?

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Yep, I think so. The car's packed. We have munchies and music and the maps and the car.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Did you get the camera?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Got it. Did you fill up the tank?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Yep, it's all set.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You're sure we're not forgetting anything.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm sure we've got all our bases covered.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, let's get going then. I love road trips.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Hmm, do you think we can make a pit stop?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
So, Erica, you said you've been on a million road trips.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
What was that all about? Where have you been?

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Well, maybe not a million road trips, but many road trips every summer.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
I used to go on a road trip with my family and we would drive many, many hours,

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
probably eight hours in one day up to Northern Canada.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh, wow, nice.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah, and then we would go camping and we would sleep outside and we would have a campfire at night.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
It was great.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Oh, a family road trip.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah, but maybe eight hours in a car is a little too long.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
Oh, yeah. Well, I've been on a different kind of road trip with some buddies of mine, some friends.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
We would drive to Las Vegas.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Really?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, so that's really fun.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
A bunch of crazy guys in a car going to Las Vegas and then just having fun and talking about everything.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So that's a much different experience in a family road trip.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Maybe that sounds a little bit more fun.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Yeah, eight hours in a car is not really that boring with all your friends.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
All right, folks, we're out of time for today, but be sure to visit our website at englishpod.com

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
and leave all your questions and comments.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Okay, well, thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye!
