00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello English there. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
And I'm Erica. And today we are going to be teaching you a very important technique, especially for the guys.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
If you want to have good look with the ladies, right?

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Well, today's lesson is called that's flattering.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Right, so we are going to be teaching you how to flatter someone.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Okay, so what does it mean to flatter someone?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Well, basically you're going to be giving compliments and you're going to make that person feel good about themselves.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
That's right. Okay, so flattering.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
Now, before we get on with this flattering lesson, we need to look at some vocabulary in vocabulary preview.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
All right, on vocabulary preview today, we have two small words.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
So the first one is bar exam.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
The bar exam.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
So the bar exam is that formal test that lawyers must do to become official lawyers.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Right, so it's that final exam in order to finally become a lawyer.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Mm-hmm.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Okay, and what about our next word?

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Well, we're also going to hear in the dialogue obnoxious obnoxious obnoxious.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay, so this is an adjective.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Yes, and it means something that is really, really annoying.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay, so something can be an ob, so something can be obnoxious or someone or someone.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Okay, very good.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
So now we have these two words that we're going to listen to in the dialogue.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
And now let's listen to two people as they flatter each other in our dialogue.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Valerie.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Hi.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Wow, how have you been?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
It's been such a long time.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Darling.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Indeed, it's been a while.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
How have you been?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Well, you look amazing.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
I love what you've done with your hair.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Really?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Thanks.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Okay, you got you having it today.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
What is your secret?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Come on.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Well, I've been watching what I eat, and I work out three times a week.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
By the way, I heard you're suddenly graduated.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Yes, my little paw is finally a doctor.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
They grew up so fast, you know.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
He is such a handsome guy.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
He gets his lips from his mother, of course.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Thank you.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
What about your daughter Pamela?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, yes.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
She had a beautiful wedding and called the Malme Mexico.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And we all attended.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Such a lovely girl.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
I hope my paw is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
That's cool.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Same here.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
We'll catch up soon.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Maybe over coffee.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
That would be great.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Give me a cool.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
See you soon.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Bye.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
All right.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
So this is your typical normal everyday behavior that women show to each other, right?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I think it's very common.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
It's very hard to argue against this because I think everyone does it.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Or at least you've heard maybe your mother or someone to talk to her friends like this, right?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
So pretend you like a person who you actually hate.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Right.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
You have to be courteous.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Is that what you're doing to me now?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
All right.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
No, I'm not.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
But we can take a look at some of this great language, very rich language that we found in

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
this dialogue in fluency builder.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Fluency builder.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
All right.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
We're doing things a little bit different in this lesson.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
So we're going to do two fluency builders.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
And in the first one, we're going to focus on language you can use to flatter someone.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Right.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
So let's get started.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
In the very first part of the dialogue, we heard Valerie say,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
I love what you've done with your hair.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I love what you've done with your hair.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
I love what you've done with.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
I love what you've done with.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Okay.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
So if somebody says this, basically they're saying,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I like the change you made.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Okay.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
And change not only to your hair, right?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
It could be anything.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
So I love what you've done with your new house.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Okay.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Or I can say, I love what you've done with your garden.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
It looks so beautiful.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Mm-hmm.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
So something that you've changed.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
You can use this phrase for.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Okay.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
And in this case, it's her hair.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
So she is complimenting her on her hair.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
We also heard Darlene say,

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
You haven't aged a day.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
You haven't aged a day.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
You haven't aged a day.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Okay.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
So now she is saying that she hasn't gotten any older.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
That's right.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Two age is to get older.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Okay.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
So this is a very common way of telling somebody you look great.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
That's right.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
You look young.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
You look young.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
You look great.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
You haven't aged a day.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
All right.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
So then they talk about their kids.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And they're talking about the sign.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
And Valerie says,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
He's such a handsome guy.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
He is such a handsome guy.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
He is such a handsome guy.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
So this structure is important because now I can change the adjective.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
And I am saying he is very intelligent.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
That's such an intelligent guy.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
That's right.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Or even this is such a good day.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
All right.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Very good.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
So now why don't we combine the two phrases that we've just heard.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I love what you've done with.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And he is such a and let's listen to some examples.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Example one.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
We love what you've done with this place.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Such a beautiful room.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Example two.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I love what you've done with your hair.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Such a nice color on you.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Example three.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I love what you've done with this space.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Such a wonderful garden.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Okay.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I really like how those two phrases can fit together.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
They are very good.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
And now you can use them together or separately like in the dialogue.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
That's right.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Let's move to our final flattering phrase.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Valerie says that Darlin's son gets his looks from his mother.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Right.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
He says he gets his looks from his mother of course.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
He gets his looks from.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Okay.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
So when she says he gets his looks from,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
she is saying his appearance.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
His positive appearance is good appearance.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Right.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
His good looks.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Okay.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
So now we can change the noun.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
And I can say he gets his intelligence from his father.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Right.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Or even he gets his beautiful singing voice from his mother.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Okay.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
So now typically you would say his mother his father or maybe one of the grandparents.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Maybe.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
But you wouldn't say he gets his good looks from his brother.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
No.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
No.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
No.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Mother Father Grandma Grandpa.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
All right.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
So now that we've covered four great ways of flattering someone,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
let's listen to this dialogue again.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
But we're going to slow it down a little bit so you can pick up on these phrases.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Valerie.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Hi.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Wow.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
How have you been?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
It's been such a long time.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Darlin.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Indeed.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
It's been a while.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
How have you been?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Wow.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
You look amazing.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I love what you've done with your hair.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Really?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Thanks.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I went to that hair salon you told me about.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
But enough about me.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Look at you.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
God, you have an interest today.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
What is your secret?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Come on.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, I've been watching what I eat and I work out three times a week.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yes.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
My little paw is finally a doctor.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
They grew up so fast, you know.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
He is such a handsome guy.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
He gets his looks from his mother of course.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Thank you.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
What about your daughter Pamela?

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Oh, yes.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
She had a beautiful wedding and cosemail Mexico and we all attended.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Such a lovely girl.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
I hope my paw is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
That's a cool.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Same here.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
We'll catch up soon.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Maybe over coffee.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
That would be great.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Give me a cool.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
See you soon.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Bye.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
Okay, so we see a lot of great flattering language in this dialogue,

09:05.000 --> 09:13.000
but we also have some really good language and phrases you can use in small talk in any situation.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Right, so maybe if you talk to a friend that you haven't seen in a while,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
we have some really great phrases for it as you say small talk.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder part two.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Fluency Builder.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Okay, so let's start with the first phrase.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
She says, Valerie, hi, wow, how are you?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
It's been such a long time.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
It's been such a long time.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It's been such a long time.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
So basically here, she's saying we haven't seen each other in a long time.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
Right, but it kind of gives you that idea that she regrets not talking her for such a long time.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Yes, she wishes she could have talked to her.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
It's been such a long time. How are you?

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
So a wonderful way to start a conversation.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
So when they start talking about their kids, Valerie says,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
by the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Right, by the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
So this phrase, by the way, I heard blah, blah, blah is really really useful.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Right, let's take a look at the first part, by the way.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
So this is a way to connect to different ideas or to start a new topic.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Exactly. And now when she says, I heard your son recently graduated.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
So we use this phrase I heard when we've got information that we're not sure about.

10:37.000 --> 10:45.000
Right, or also you are demonstrating interest about a certain topic or a news event that you would like to know about.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Right, and so basically you're asking the other person, tell me about this.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Right, so I can say, hey, by the way, I heard you got married.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
So then I tell you all about my wedding.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Exactly.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Okay, so this is a very common way of talking to someone or getting some more information from a person.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
So let's listen to some more examples of by the way.

11:04.000 --> 11:14.000
Example one, by the way, I heard you recently been promoted.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Example two.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
I heard your daughter just had a baby. Congratulations.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Example three.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Oh, I had you just go back from holiday and France.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
All right, now since these two ladies don't like each other very much.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
They want to end the conversation, right?

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Right, they want to end the conversation and well, you want to end it in a polite way, right?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
So they use a really great phrase here.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
They said, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Right, so it's like, well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
So it's been great talking to you.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I've enjoyed talking to you.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
Right, so this is a very polite, very subtle way of saying, hey, I have to go or buy.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I can't talk anymore.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah, when you say that, you know that the conversation is ending.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Exactly. Now she says, I have to get going.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
What does it mean get going? That doesn't make much sense.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Basically, it just means leave.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Okay, I have to leave. I have to get going.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
You should get going, you're going to be late.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Exactly. Okay.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Some really good small talk phrases that are useful in any situation.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
So why don't we hear them again one more time by listening to the dialogue?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Valerie, hi.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Wow, how have you been? It's been such a long time.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Darling, indeed, it's been a while.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
How have you been? How you look amazing.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I love what you've done with your hair.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Really? Thanks.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Okay, you got you having it today.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
What is your secret?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Come on.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
I've been watching what I eat, and I work out three times a week.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
By the way, I heard you're suddenly graduated.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Yes, my little paw is finally a doctor.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
They grew up so fast, you know.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
He is such a handsome guy.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
He gets his lips from his mother, of course.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Thank you.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
What about your daughter Pamela?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
I heard she passed the bar exam, and married recently.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Oh, yes. She had a beautiful wedding and calls him out in Mexico.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
And we all attended.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Such a lovely girl.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
I hope my paw is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
That's of course.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Same here.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
That would be great.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Give me a cool.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
See you soon.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Bye.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
All right, very good.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
So now you have a couple of phrases that you can use to flatter someone, be it your friend,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000

And well, they are very, very useful, and if you use them correctly, of course.
