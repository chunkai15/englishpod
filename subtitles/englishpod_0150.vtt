00:00.000 --> 00:11.840
Hello everyone and welcome back to English Pod. My name is Marco and my name is Catherine and today we're talking about one of my least favorite things Marco

00:11.840 --> 00:13.840
Mosquitoes

00:13.840 --> 00:21.680
Mosquitoes they're all over the place especially in summer or near water and for me the worst part is when you were trying to sleep

00:21.680 --> 00:25.440
And there's a mosquito that just keeps on biting you and won't let you sleep

00:26.400 --> 00:34.080
Yeah, you can kind of hear it around your your head. Yeah, I hear you hear. Uh, I hate that or when you just get bitten and you're in bed

00:34.080 --> 00:39.840
And it's just it's just so much you can't burn sometimes. Yeah, so that has what we're talking about today fun stuff

00:40.400 --> 00:44.960
Let's jump right into this dialogue and we're back in a minute to talk about what's going on

00:44.960 --> 00:59.360
The mosquitoes are biting me too. I can't stop scratching there everywhere sneaky little jerks

01:00.000 --> 01:05.520
Do you have any bugs brain? No, I forgot to buy some then we'll have to put up with it

01:06.160 --> 01:12.160
We can cover ourselves with beer that way if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep

01:12.800 --> 01:18.800
That's without doubt the best idea you've ever had let's do it

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Run there's different more

01:30.640 --> 01:35.200
All right, we're back. So let's take a look at some of these words in language takeaway

01:37.040 --> 01:39.040
Language takeaway

01:39.520 --> 01:46.960
All right, so as we mentioned we're going to be talking about mosquitoes and well these are just little small insects that suck your blood

01:47.440 --> 01:49.440
They do and they're very thin and

01:50.960 --> 01:55.120
Not much to say about them. They were very important in the movie Jurassic Park if you remember that

01:55.920 --> 02:02.800
Right now what's the difference between a mosquito and a fly? Okay a fly usually is just annoying

02:02.800 --> 02:08.480
It doesn't suck your blood, but a mosquito does it sucks your blood and flies are

02:08.480 --> 02:16.640
Fatter and like shorter and they're big and black and they're green kind of some black and green and they

02:17.440 --> 02:23.440
Yeah, they just buzz around so mosquitoes actually bite you. Okay, so a mosquito and they fly

02:23.760 --> 02:29.040
Now if a mosquito bites you you really really want to scratch that's right. So

02:29.680 --> 02:36.080
You feel like you need to scratch your body because you have this bite. You know, it's really an allergy

02:36.640 --> 02:41.280
And you have a red bump on your arm a red mark and you scratch and it gets worse and worse

02:41.680 --> 02:46.480
All right, and we'll be on to our next word mosquitoes have a reputation of being sneaky

02:46.960 --> 02:52.080
Okay, so you can say sneaky about a lot of things one, you know obviously we're saying mosquitoes are very sneaky

02:52.800 --> 02:57.120
That means that they can kind of hide and get you when you're not expecting it

02:57.200 --> 03:01.360
Yeah, because sometimes during the day you don't really see them in your room, right?

03:01.360 --> 03:07.280
They're hiding or they're in a place where you can't really see them and then a night all the sudden they come out

03:07.280 --> 03:13.840
They come out so and they're very hard to see they fly around in in a way that's very difficult to catch them or kill them

03:13.840 --> 03:19.760
Right, we could say thieves are very sneaky like a thief is someone who steals something and they like to sneak

03:19.760 --> 03:24.560
Around and hide in the dark and them and you're not expecting it they come out and they still your stuff

03:24.640 --> 03:30.720
Exactly and now what do we what do we do or what do we use in order to prevent mosquitoes from biting us?

03:30.720 --> 03:33.520
This is essential especially if you're going to the beach

03:34.080 --> 03:38.320
We bring bugs spray bugs spray so a spray is something that

03:39.680 --> 03:44.400
That you can usually have in a can that you push a button then it comes out all right. It's like

03:45.040 --> 03:50.560
It's like water, but it keeps the bugs away so a bug spray keeps bugs away not only mosquitoes, but like

03:50.880 --> 03:56.320
Slice too flies or any other type of bug now specifically for mosquitoes you would use maybe a

03:56.960 --> 04:03.520
mosquito repellent right so repellent is it means something that pushes or keeps away things you don't want

04:03.520 --> 04:09.280
So something that keeps mosquitoes away is called a mosquito repellent and usually it's a cream you put on your arms

04:09.280 --> 04:16.640
Relax all right very good so interesting words that we've just taken a look at let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll be right back

04:21.440 --> 04:28.800
The mosquitoes are biting me me too. I can't stop scratching there everywhere sneaky little jerks

04:29.360 --> 04:34.960
Do you have any bugs spray no I forgot to buy some then we'll have to put up with it

04:35.600 --> 04:41.600
We can cover ourselves with beer that way if they bite us they'll get drunk and fall sleep

04:42.320 --> 04:44.320
That's without doubt the

04:45.120 --> 04:50.800
best idea you've ever had let's do it run there thirsty for more

04:54.640 --> 05:00.000
All right we're back so now let's take a look at a couple of different phrases on fluency builder

05:01.200 --> 05:02.720
Fluency builder

05:03.040 --> 05:06.480
All right, so the first phrase is very very common

05:06.960 --> 05:14.240
The person in the dialogue says that they're going to have to put up with it put up with these mosquitoes because they didn't have any bugs spray

05:14.400 --> 05:20.240
So this phrase to put up with is really important. All right, so if you put up with something and these that you tolerate it all right

05:20.240 --> 05:25.440
That means even if you don't want to you'll still handle it. You'll still have to deal with that you accept it

05:26.000 --> 05:31.760
So maybe you have a little brother that's very annoying and you just have to put up with him. There's no other option

05:32.480 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, or

05:34.000 --> 05:39.520
Someone says to you you're just gonna have to put up with it or you say I won't put up with it anymore

05:39.600 --> 05:46.880
I won't handle it anymore. I'm done. All right, so I think this is a great phrase for us to take a look at a couple of different examples

05:48.320 --> 05:50.320
Example one

05:50.320 --> 05:54.320
I can't put up with the noise any longer turn that music down

05:55.840 --> 05:57.840
Example two

05:58.160 --> 06:02.080
If you can put up with the smell then stinky tofu is actually very tasty

06:03.360 --> 06:05.360
Example three

06:06.080 --> 06:10.000
I've had to put up with him for too long. I want a new roommate

06:13.120 --> 06:19.600
And after this we've got another phrase we're talking about beer. Okay, and so the person says oh I have an idea

06:19.840 --> 06:24.160
Instead of bugs spray we can we can cover ourselves with beer

06:24.880 --> 06:27.840
So to cover yourself or cover ourselves

06:28.480 --> 06:34.640
So it means that we put it all over us right so you could even cover yourself with bugs spray

06:34.720 --> 06:39.680
Okay, so every part of your body you put bugs spray on head to toe head to toe

06:40.000 --> 06:45.600
Now you can cover yourself under a tree maybe or you can cover yourself with a blanket

06:45.920 --> 06:52.560
Okay, so to cover yourself to completely hide under something and finally we have the response to this idea

06:52.560 --> 06:58.480
The answer the person says oh without a doubt that means absolutely or definitely

06:58.800 --> 07:00.800
Okay, so there is no doubt

07:00.960 --> 07:09.200
It is true or it is certain right so a doubt is something that maybe you're not so sure about you're not convinced

07:09.200 --> 07:15.040
But you can say this is without a doubt the best mosquito spray or this is without a doubt the best cake

07:15.040 --> 07:19.520
I've ever eaten that means it's definitely the best cake of ever eaten all right

07:19.520 --> 07:25.280
So I think we've covered all the phrases now why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back

07:31.440 --> 07:41.200
The mosquitoes are fighting me too. I can't stop scratching here everywhere sneaky little jerks

07:41.840 --> 07:47.360
Do you have any bugs spray? No, I forgot to buy some then we'll have to put up with it

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
We can cover ourselves with beer that way if they bite us they'll get drunk and fall asleep

07:54.800 --> 07:56.800
That's without doubt the

07:57.680 --> 08:00.720
Best idea you've ever had let's do it

08:03.840 --> 08:05.840
Run there's different more

08:13.840 --> 08:17.600
Mosquitoes are very annoying but at times it can be very dangerous, right?

08:17.920 --> 08:21.120
They can there are a couple of diseases that can be passed

08:21.920 --> 08:27.760
By mosquito bites one of them is malaria and that's I think pretty common in Southeast Asia and South Asia

08:27.760 --> 08:34.720
Now there was another situation where people believe that if a mosquito bit a person infected with HIV or AIDS

08:35.040 --> 08:37.040
They could pass it on to another person

08:37.040 --> 08:40.320
Aha, well, I don't know that that's even possible

08:40.320 --> 08:44.480
Right, there's no AIDS carrying mosquitoes, but there's another disease called dengue fever

08:44.480 --> 08:48.880
Dengue fever. And this is another very dangerous one. It's also known as brick bone fever

08:48.960 --> 08:53.440
And I think it's it's so painful. It feels like your bones are breaking and that's the game comes out

08:53.440 --> 08:58.240
It's very common in South America as well and because we have such a tropical climate

08:58.800 --> 09:01.520
That in the rainforests of Brazil, Peru, Colombia

09:01.840 --> 09:05.840
It's common to to see this but not so much anymore another eradicating it

09:06.720 --> 09:11.600
All right, so an interesting topic mosquitoes are not only irritating, but can be dangerous

09:12.000 --> 09:18.160
