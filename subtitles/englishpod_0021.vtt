Hello English learners and welcome back to another great lesson with English

00:06.160 --> 00:09.920
Pod, my name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we're bringing you a great

00:09.920 --> 00:14.720
intermediate lesson with some really useful vocabulary. Some vocabulary you can

00:14.720 --> 00:19.520
use to describe your job. Yes, this is a really common situation when you

00:19.520 --> 00:24.720
someone asks you what you do and you have to tell them. Exactly so today's lesson is

00:24.720 --> 00:30.720
all about facts. So before we jump into our dialogue, let's start with our vocabulary preview.

00:31.600 --> 00:37.040
The vocabulary preview. We have two simple phrases today that you'll hear in our dialogue for our

00:37.040 --> 00:46.400
vocabulary preview. The first one is VP, VP, VP. So the VP of a company is the

00:46.400 --> 00:52.880
vice president's vice president, exactly. Yeah, simple little acronym. And the next word is

00:52.880 --> 01:01.920
Fortune 500 company. Fortune 500 company. So a Fortune 500 company is

01:02.880 --> 01:10.000
I'll let you explain. Well, Fortune magazine ranks the 500 biggest companies in the

01:10.000 --> 01:16.320
US. So a Fortune 500 company basically is one of the 500 biggest companies in the US. Okay,

01:16.320 --> 01:20.800
that's simple. Yep. All right, well with those words, it sounds like we're going to be

01:20.880 --> 01:24.640
talking to some important people today. Yes, we are going to be talking to some

01:24.640 --> 01:29.760
important people. So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time. Now it's going to be

01:29.760 --> 01:34.160
a little bit fast, but you don't have to worry about it. Because we'll come back and explain

01:34.160 --> 01:40.400
all of the important vocabulary.

01:41.040 --> 01:50.480
Oh, look, this caravan of boyfriend. She's always going on about him at the office.

01:52.720 --> 02:02.480
Great, they're so us. They come in this way. Oh, man. Jessica, Arthur, hi. I'd like you to meet my

02:02.480 --> 02:09.840
boyfriend, Greg. He's the VP of quality and safety or a top Fortune 500 food company.

02:10.400 --> 02:18.080
Nice to meet you. This is my husband, Arthur. Hey, how's it going? Hello. Caroline talks about you

02:18.080 --> 02:24.400
all the time. I guess it must be pretty busy at work. Wow. Yeah, VP position is not easy, you know.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.800
I implement policies and procedures nationwide, various departments, as well as train

02:30.800 --> 02:36.160
junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations. I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality

02:36.160 --> 02:44.400
control for the entire East Coast. That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me. Oh, yeah,

02:44.400 --> 02:52.560
that sounds exciting. And what about you, Arthur? What do you do for living? Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.

03:07.040 --> 03:14.720
All right, great music for our dialogue again, huh? chosen by, by more of course. Yeah, top gun is one of

03:14.720 --> 03:20.080
my all-time favorite movies and top gun pilot. What a cool profession. An excellent profession,

03:20.080 --> 03:25.440
much cooler than being like the VP. Yeah, boring. Yeah. Anyway, this guy was a bit of a jerk,

03:25.440 --> 03:30.880
don't you think? Yeah, you can tell a little bit of the sarcastic tone he had in his voice.

03:30.880 --> 03:35.920
Definitely, but he did use some interesting phrases and we can talk about those now. Right, so

03:36.080 --> 03:44.480
let's take a look at language takeaway. Language takeaway. Our first word for language takeaways is

03:44.480 --> 03:52.800
implement implement implement. Let's listen to some examples of this word to help us understand

03:52.880 --> 04:01.680
its meaning. Example one. Our company has to implement this sales strategy.

04:05.120 --> 04:11.920
Example two. Sarah will be responsible for implementing the plan.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.560
Example three.

04:16.640 --> 04:21.680
All right, implemented several new policies.

04:24.400 --> 04:31.040
Okay, great examples and just in case to implement means to put into action, put into action.

04:31.040 --> 04:38.400
Exactly. Our second word for language takeaway policies, policy is policies, policies.

04:38.960 --> 04:45.680
So policies are basically rules and regulations. Exactly, formal rules for a company or

04:45.680 --> 04:54.640
an organization. Exactly, policies. Great. Third word. Over C. Over C. Over C. Over C.

04:55.200 --> 05:02.160
So when you oversee operations, it means like you watch it to make sure it's okay. You supervise it.

05:02.160 --> 05:07.360
This is an excellent word to use when you want to talk about your job responsibilities. Right,

05:07.360 --> 05:14.240
oversee. Great. And our last word for language takeaway, it's kind of tricky. So let's

05:14.240 --> 05:22.080
listen to how it was used in our dialogue. That alone means I have 1500 employees under me.

05:25.120 --> 05:33.680
That alone means I have 1500 employees under me. So this guy has 1500 employees under him.

05:33.760 --> 05:40.000
Meaning he supervises 1500 employees. Right, he manages 1500 employees. He must be a busy man.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.960
Yes, for 1500 employees. How many employees do you have under you, Erica?

05:44.960 --> 05:51.120
Uh, too. Yeah, not quite as much as 1500. Yeah, because I'm not a VP, right? Right, yeah, hey.

05:51.120 --> 05:56.160
Not yet, but you will. Okay. All right. So with this in mind, we are ready to listen to our

05:56.160 --> 05:59.520
dialogue for a second time and this time it's going to be slower.

05:59.680 --> 06:09.600
Oh, look, there's Caroline and a boyfriend. She's always going on about him at the office.

06:10.720 --> 06:23.440
Oh, great. They saw us. They're coming this way. Oh, man. Jessica, Arthur, hi. I'd like you to meet my

06:23.440 --> 06:30.720
boyfriend, Greg. He's the VP of quality and safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

06:31.840 --> 06:37.120
Nice to meet you. This is my husband, Arthur. Hey, how's it going, though?

06:38.560 --> 06:43.280
Caroline talks about you all the time. I guess you must be pretty busy at work.

06:44.240 --> 06:52.240
Well, yeah, the VP position is not easy, you know. I implement policies and procedures nationwide

06:52.880 --> 06:59.520
various departments as well as train junior managers in FDA and EPA regulations.

07:00.160 --> 07:06.080
I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire East Coast.

07:06.640 --> 07:15.280
That alone means I have 1500 employees under me. Wow. Yeah, that sounds exciting.

07:16.240 --> 07:23.360
What about you, Arthur? What do you do for a living? Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.

07:26.800 --> 07:32.000
Okay, great stuff. With this, now we can start with our fluency builder for today.

07:33.280 --> 07:39.840
Fluency builder. We heard some excellent phrases in this dialogue. Some phrases that sound really

07:40.000 --> 07:47.280
natural. Hey, yes, especially the first one that we have today is whenever someone talks and talks

07:47.280 --> 07:54.080
and talks and just and continuously talks without stopping, you would say, she's always going on

07:54.080 --> 08:00.320
about him at the office. She's always going on about him at the office.

08:02.640 --> 08:07.920
This is a really natural way of saying keeps talking about. Right. Keep talking about him. Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.640
So we have a few examples of how this phrase works. Let's listen. Example one.

08:17.680 --> 08:23.840
My boss is always going on about how we need to save money. It's all he talks about.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.000
Example two.

08:31.520 --> 08:36.320
Gary is always going on about his kids. He's always talking about how smart they are.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.440
Example three.

08:44.320 --> 08:48.480
My mom is always going on about how I should get married.

08:51.520 --> 08:56.800
Okay, excellent. It's clear now. Yes. Okay, so let's move on to our second phrase for today.

08:56.800 --> 09:01.360
And this is a great one to use whenever you meet someone for the first time. Or when you start

09:01.360 --> 09:05.840
to talk to someone for the first time. Great. Hey, how's it going?

09:06.160 --> 09:15.200
Hey, how's it going? So this is a really relaxed and natural way of saying, how are you?

09:15.200 --> 09:20.240
Oh, are you? Yeah. So yeah, you can just say, hey, how's it going? Yeah, really natural sounding.

09:20.960 --> 09:26.560
Now our third phrase is the most important one of our dialogue. Yes. And it's a really

09:26.560 --> 09:32.480
common situation. When someone asks you about your job, they might say this.

09:33.440 --> 09:38.080
Who are there? What do you do for a living? Who are there? What do you do for a living?

09:39.760 --> 09:46.400
So this is a really great way of asking, what work do you do or what is your job? Yes. I know

09:46.400 --> 09:52.880
I know a lot of students sometimes say, what is your job? Yeah. And that is, it's kind of

09:52.880 --> 09:58.560
correct, but not really. It doesn't sound very natural. Right. So you want to use what do you do?

09:58.560 --> 10:03.920
Or what do you do for a living? Sounds great. That's the way you ask someone. What is their job?

10:03.920 --> 10:08.640
And that's how you sound. Super natural. Okay. So we're ready now to listen to our dialogue

10:08.640 --> 10:13.120
a last time. And now you are ready to understand everything.

10:20.720 --> 10:26.400
Oh, look, this caravan of boyfriend. She's always going on about him at the office.

10:28.640 --> 10:39.040
Great. They're so us. They come in this way. Oh, man. Jessica Arthur. Hi. I'd like you to meet my boyfriend,

10:39.040 --> 10:47.120
Greg. He's the VP of Quality and Safety for a top Fortune 500 food company. Nice to meet you.

10:48.240 --> 10:55.280
This is why it has been author. Hey, how's it going? Hello. Caroline talks about you all the time.

10:55.360 --> 11:00.320
I guess it must be pretty busy at work. Wow. Yeah. VP position is not easy. You know.

11:01.840 --> 11:06.960
I implement policies and procedures nationwide. Very departments as well as train junior

11:06.960 --> 11:12.560
managers in FDA and EPA regulations. I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control

11:12.560 --> 11:22.000
for the entire East Coast. That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me. Oh, yeah, that sounds exciting.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.480
And what about you, Arthur? What do you do for a living? Oh, I'm a top gun pilot.

11:43.680 --> 11:48.880
Okay, so I have a little challenge for our listeners today. What is it? Two challenges. Okay.

11:49.520 --> 11:56.560
The first one, who performs the song that you heard and what is the song called? Okay. I don't

11:56.560 --> 12:03.120
know the answer. So I'm looking forward to seeing what users do. And the second one is what is the

12:03.120 --> 12:09.680
number one company in the Fortune 500? Oh, I also don't know this answer. Two great questions.

12:09.680 --> 12:14.720

12:15.040 --> 12:21.760
