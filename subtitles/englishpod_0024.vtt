00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod, my name is Marko

00:06.640 --> 00:12.880
and I'm Erica and today we're going out to eat yes good thing too because I'm hungry

00:12.880 --> 00:17.520
I know it's almost lunchtime yeah so today we're going to be talking about eating at a restaurant

00:17.520 --> 00:24.000
and giving some great recommendations and suggestions yes we have language for describing food

00:24.000 --> 00:29.600
for describing restaurants and for making suggestions great so let's start with our

00:29.600 --> 00:36.240
vocabulary preview for this lesson very vocabulary preview we have two words today from our

00:36.240 --> 00:42.320
dialogue which you'll need to know to understand the dialogue great the first one that we have today

00:42.320 --> 00:52.560
is food poisoning food poisoning food poisoning so food poisoning is not a good thing not a good thing

00:53.520 --> 01:02.080
it is when you eat some bad food and that food makes you sick so you get food poisoning okay so

01:02.080 --> 01:09.600
food poisoning yeah not a good thing okay the next words allergic allergic allergic allergic

01:10.240 --> 01:17.600
so when you're allergic to something it makes you sick that one thing makes you sick right for example

01:17.680 --> 01:25.600
I'm allergic to seafood right if I eat seafood I cannot breathe okay so you definitely want to stay

01:25.600 --> 01:33.040
away from fish yes yes some people are allergic to nuts like peanuts or maybe milk milk yeah cool

01:33.040 --> 01:40.160
so when one type of food makes you sick you are allergic to that food okay great so with this in mind

01:40.160 --> 01:45.600
now we can listen to our dialogue for the first time at its normal speed but don't worry if you don't

01:45.600 --> 01:49.760
get everything now because we'll come back and teach you the important language

01:55.280 --> 01:59.520
do you have any plans for the evening we were thinking of checking out a restaurant the

01:59.520 --> 02:04.720
neighborhood do you have any suggestions I know there's really nice Italian place the food is

02:04.720 --> 02:10.960
fantastic and the decor is beautiful I'd recommend giving it to try actually I'm not all that

02:10.960 --> 02:16.240
crazy about Italian food I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter in that case I know

02:16.240 --> 02:22.400
a great little bistro and they can really tasty seafood platter the fish is outstanding it sounds

02:22.400 --> 02:31.600
fantastic but I'm allergic to seafood so okay well let me think oh I know this great little place

02:31.600 --> 02:36.640
it's just a hole in the wall but they do the most amazing sandwiches you can give them a try

02:37.600 --> 02:41.680
Ella you took me there last time I visited and I got food poisoning remember

02:48.000 --> 02:53.200
well I'm getting hungry just thinking about all of those great restaurants yeah some really good

02:53.200 --> 02:59.760
recommendations except for food poisoning right no that's okay let's start with our language takeaway

02:59.760 --> 03:10.640
for this lesson language takeaway our first word on language takeaway is check out check out check

03:10.640 --> 03:16.800
out check out so we have some great examples on how we can use check out in different situations

03:16.800 --> 03:25.040
and then you can understand the meaning example one have you been to new cafe next door yeah I checked

03:25.040 --> 03:35.840
it out yesterday the food was great example two hey check out my new car

03:39.760 --> 03:46.400
example three I'm going to check out the new shopping mall these weekends

03:47.280 --> 03:55.440
so I can understand that it just means look at yeah look at or yeah or go see so let's go check out

03:55.440 --> 04:05.680
that new bar in town yeah okay cool next word is bistro bistro bistro bistro so what's a bistro it's

04:05.680 --> 04:11.760
kind of complicated but it's like a small restaurant that's not really cheap though not so cheap

04:11.760 --> 04:19.200
but not so expensive and it's usually French yes so yeah small informal restaurant yeah bistro

04:20.560 --> 04:28.560
okay so our third phrase for today is not all that crazy about not all that crazy about

04:28.560 --> 04:36.320
I'm not all that crazy about okay again kind of a funny phrase but we've got some examples that

04:36.320 --> 04:46.400
will help you understand the meaning example one do you want to go shopping with me tomorrow

04:46.400 --> 04:49.680
I'm not all that crazy about shopping I don't like spending money

04:54.080 --> 05:01.360
example two I'm not crazy about jazz music my change to song

05:01.440 --> 05:10.160
so this is just a really polite way of saying you don't like something exactly but now the

05:10.160 --> 05:18.240
opposite of this would be tasty tasty that's our fourth word tasty tasty so when something is

05:18.240 --> 05:23.760
tasty it's good it's good like delicious delicious yeah you know what in English we almost

05:23.760 --> 05:30.880
never say the food is delicious but we always say it's really tasty yes this is really tasty yes

05:31.440 --> 05:40.800
tasty and our last phrase for language takeaway in the mood for in the mood for in the mood for

05:41.440 --> 05:46.160
let's listen to some examples of this phrase and we'll understand the meaning a little bit better

05:47.040 --> 05:53.840
example one we always eat hamburgers for dinner I'm in the mood for something different

05:53.920 --> 06:06.400
example two let's watch movie how about Texas chainsaw massacre I am not in the mood for a

06:06.400 --> 06:16.160
horror movie so if I'm in the mood for something I feel like doing or eating or watching

06:16.160 --> 06:21.200
watching yeah it means you want to do that now yeah I'm in the mood for okay

06:22.160 --> 06:28.320
some great language we just looked at and I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue a second time

06:34.080 --> 06:40.560
do you two have any plans for the evening we were thinking of checking out a restaurant in the

06:40.560 --> 06:49.840
neighborhood do you have any suggestions I know this really nice Italian place the food is fantastic

06:49.920 --> 06:58.480
and the decor is beautiful I'd recommend giving it a try actually I'm not all that crazy about

06:58.480 --> 07:06.240
Italian food I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter in that case I know a great little

07:06.240 --> 07:14.960
bistro they make a really tasty seafood platter the fish is outstanding it sounds fantastic

07:15.760 --> 07:24.880
but I'm allergic to seafood so okay well let me think oh I know this great little place

07:25.280 --> 07:32.880
it's just a hole in the wall but they do the most amazing sandwiches you've got to give them a try

07:33.120 --> 07:40.480
Ella you took me there last time I visited and I got food poisoning remember

07:44.480 --> 07:49.120
okay some really great and useful phrases there and I know you want to talk about specifically

07:49.120 --> 07:55.520
some of these phrases yes today's lesson is all about making recommendations right right

07:55.520 --> 08:01.600
so let's look at some useful phrases in fluency builder fluency builder

08:01.760 --> 08:06.640
so in the dialogue we heard a great way of asking for a suggestion that's right let's listen

08:07.520 --> 08:15.760
do you have any suggestions do you have any suggestions so that's how you would ask for a suggestion

08:15.760 --> 08:21.760
or you can say something else like do you have any ideas yeah or you might say do you have any thoughts

08:22.800 --> 08:29.680
okay so that's great ways asking for a suggestion yep in response to this you can say something like this

08:29.840 --> 08:38.960
I'd recommend giving it to try I'd recommend giving it to try we also heard another phrase

08:38.960 --> 08:46.960
that we use for giving suggestions you can give them a try you've got to give them a try

08:48.480 --> 08:54.960
so these two phrases are great I'd recommend or you gotta give them a try yeah great ways of

08:54.960 --> 09:00.080
suggesting yes now what's really important here is the pronunciation of these words right

09:00.080 --> 09:08.080
yeah you'll notice that we don't say I would recommend right we use the contraction I'd

09:08.080 --> 09:16.320
I'd I'd I'd recommend I'd recommend similarly in the phrase you have got to

09:17.280 --> 09:23.680
we shorten that to say you gotta you gotta you gotta give them a try you gotta you know what

09:23.680 --> 09:29.760
guys if you can shorten your phrases like this if you can push the sounds together you'll sound

09:29.760 --> 09:36.000
a lot more natural hey and also you'll be able to understand because in movies or in shows

09:36.000 --> 09:41.280
they will never say you have got to give them a try yeah yeah so if you know how to use this

09:41.280 --> 09:47.120
form you'll understand what they mean exactly okay great well why don't we listen to the dialogue

09:47.120 --> 09:51.200
a third time and you'll hear some of these contractions in the dialogue

09:56.480 --> 10:00.720

times that I ever had food poisoning was uh when I was traveling in Morocco okay I had some really

11:06.560 --> 11:13.280

11:53.600 --> 11:59.920
