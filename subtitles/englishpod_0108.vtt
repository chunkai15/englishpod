00:00.000 --> 00:07.800
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great podcast here at EnglishPod,

00:07.800 --> 00:08.800
my name is Marco.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.800
And I'm Erica.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.920
And today we're going to be bringing you bad news.

00:12.920 --> 00:13.920
That's right.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.760
Actually what we're really going to be bringing you is language to talk about bad news.

00:17.760 --> 00:18.760
Exactly.

00:18.760 --> 00:22.040
So maybe you have to give bad news to your boss, to your parents.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.040
I don't know.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.720
Somebody and we're going to be teaching you how to do this in English.

00:25.720 --> 00:29.120
Well obviously it's always difficult to tell somebody bad news.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.520
But in your second language it's even harder.

00:31.520 --> 00:35.680
So we're going to try and help you today with some great phrases and vocabulary items.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.480
We're not going to preview anything today.

00:37.480 --> 00:42.640
Let's go directly to our dialogue where we will be in a company and one of the employees

00:42.640 --> 00:45.840
is going to be giving bad news to his boss.

00:45.840 --> 00:54.680
So let's listen.

00:54.680 --> 00:59.440
Now that we've been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed, give

00:59.440 --> 01:00.600
us some good news.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.960
How are things looking for us in terms of sales this month?

01:02.960 --> 01:07.240
Oh well, would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?

01:07.240 --> 01:11.080
Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.320
Well sir, our sales have dropped.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.320
No plunge.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.720
50% in the past month alone.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.800
We are currently overstocking overstaffing.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.800
Our profits are falling fast.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.480
The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory or getting rid of our

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
staff.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.960
If we consider redundancies, it costs us a fortune because of the new regulations governing

01:29.960 --> 01:31.520
compensation packages.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
It's a real mess.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.720
We're coming out loud.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.960
How fast are we losing money?

01:36.960 --> 01:38.440
How can I put this?

01:38.440 --> 01:43.400
Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for chapter 11 and less than 3 months.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.400
What?

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
Cheese.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.040
How can this have happened?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.400
So what's the bad news?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.280
Oh, that's the really bad news.

01:50.280 --> 01:54.760
Our suppliers suffered QC problems and will half of our production is faulty.

01:54.760 --> 01:59.040
We're going to have to recall all items sold in the last quarter and the worst part.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.800
We're going to have to shoulder this cost.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.520
Are you choking?

02:02.520 --> 02:04.360
Get the supplier on the line now.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.400
They have to assume the cost of this mess.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.960
We try that sir.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.280
The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.720
Oh, we're doomed.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.240
There's some really good news though.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.240
Really?

02:15.240 --> 02:16.240
Who had?

02:16.240 --> 02:17.240
I got offered a new job.

02:17.240 --> 02:25.080
All right, it sounds like a pretty tough time for this company, doesn't it?

02:25.080 --> 02:26.080
But good news for the employee.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.400
He won't be a jobless.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.240
Well, I guess he knows when to get out.

02:30.240 --> 02:35.560
But why don't we take a look at some of the language now in language takeaway?

02:35.560 --> 02:38.000
Language takeaway.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.400
So on language takeaway today, we have five vocabulary items and let's start with the

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
first one.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
All right.

02:44.400 --> 02:50.560
The boss, you know, he's talking about the gory details of our disastrous first quarter.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.040
So let's look at the phrase gory details.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.200
All right, so gory details.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.200
Gory details.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.560
This sounds kind of strange.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.560
Gory details.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
It seems very scary.

02:59.560 --> 03:03.760
Well, the word gory comes from gore, like blood and guts, right?

03:03.760 --> 03:04.760
Exactly.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.120
That's why it sounds a little bit scary to me.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.120
Yep.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
So gory details.

03:08.120 --> 03:14.360
I mean, all the little details of a negative or shocking or bad.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.360
That's the situation.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.360
Okay.

03:16.360 --> 03:20.800
So the gory details of the meeting, so all the nasty, negative stuff.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.280
Or the gory detail, or you can say the newspaper reported all the gory details of the

03:25.280 --> 03:26.280
murder.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.280
Okay.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.280
Very good.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.280
So gory details.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.520
So the employee was talking about how bad the company was doing.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.520
And he mentioned this word redundancies.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.760
Redundancies.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.880
They are considering redundancies.

03:38.880 --> 03:39.880
Okay.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.240
So redundancies again.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.480
It's based on the word to be redundant.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.480
All right.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.480
And that means to not be needed anymore.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.480
Okay.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.080
So redundancies are basically firing people.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.560
It's well, laying people off.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.960
People that you don't need anymore.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.560
They are redundancies.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.560
All right.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.920
So this is actually a British term redundancies to become redundant because in American

04:01.920 --> 04:03.960
English, you would just say layoffs.

04:03.960 --> 04:04.960
Yep.

04:04.960 --> 04:05.960
Okay.

04:05.960 --> 04:06.960
Very good.

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
All right.

04:07.960 --> 04:08.960
So moving on.

04:08.960 --> 04:12.080
And maybe they should or shouldn't lay some people off.

04:12.080 --> 04:17.280
But one of the problems were the regulations governing compensation packages.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.280
Okay.

04:18.280 --> 04:22.520
So regulations governing compensation packages.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.920
Regulations governing something.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.160
So we have a noun governing noun.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.160
Mm-hmm.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.160
What does that mean?

04:28.160 --> 04:29.160
All right.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.040
So I think it would help us to understand this a little better if we listened to some

04:31.040 --> 04:35.920
examples of this pattern noun governing noun.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.880
Example one.

04:37.920 --> 04:41.320
I don't agree with the regulations governing income taxes.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.880
People shouldn't have to give away their hard earned money.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.120
Example two.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.360
We need to protect the environment.

04:50.360 --> 04:55.120
Therefore there will be new policies governing corporate levels of pollution starting

04:55.120 --> 04:58.120
next month.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.000
Example three.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.720
The lack of regulations governing city transportation has led to many traffic accidents.

05:07.720 --> 05:08.720
Okay.

05:08.720 --> 05:09.720
Great examples.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.840
And well, before we move on, this compensation package is, I guess, it's all the things

05:13.840 --> 05:16.720
that the company gives you when they lay you off, right?

05:16.720 --> 05:17.720
Right.

05:17.720 --> 05:23.720
Maybe a certain portion of your retirement benefits or months pay, et cetera.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.720
Okay.

05:24.720 --> 05:25.720
Compensation packages.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.720
All right.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.480
So moving on to our next item on language takeaway.

05:29.480 --> 05:34.480
We have two shoulder the cost to shoulder the cost.

05:34.480 --> 05:35.480
All right.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.280
So if I shoulder something.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.280
You have to carry it.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.280
I carry it.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.280
Yeah.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.280
That's a good one.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.560
So basically it's the same as your shoulder your body.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.280
So you carry this cost or your carry this responsibility.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.280
Yeah.

05:47.280 --> 05:52.280
So you might also hear shoulder the burden to shoulder the burden.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.280
Yeah.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.280
So it just means to carry the responsibility.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.280
Okay.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
To share it.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.280
Yeah.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.280
All right.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.280
Interesting.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.280
And we have one more word on language takeaway.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.280
And the factory has gone under.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.280
To go under.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.280
All right.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.280
When something goes under.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.280
A company goes under.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.280
It goes bankrupt.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.280
It goes bankrupt.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.280
So it's not working anymore.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.280
That's right.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.280
All right.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.280
So to go under.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.280
Great vocabulary items here on language takeaway today.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.280
It's time for us to move on to the next segment of our show where we're going

06:24.280 --> 06:25.280
to look at some phrases.

06:25.280 --> 06:29.280
So let's start now with fluency builder.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.280
Fluency builder.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.280
All right.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.280
So we've got some phrases that you can use.

06:34.280 --> 06:39.280
When somebody's going to tell you some bad news, but also some phrases you can use to deliver bad news.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.280
All right.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.280
So let's start with our first phrase.

06:43.280 --> 06:47.280
So the, you know, the boss is getting ready to prepare for this bad news.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.280
And he says, lay it on me.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.280
He's like, okay.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.280
Lay it on me.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.280
Lay it on me.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.280
So if I say this, lay it on me and just saying.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.280
Tell me.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.280
Exactly.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.280
So give me the bad news.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.280
Mm-hmm.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.280
All right.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.280
So lay it on me.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.280
Very informal though.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.280
Yeah.

07:04.280 --> 07:08.280
But our next phrase, you know, the boss is hearing about all this bad news.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.280
And he says, for crying out loud.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.280
For crying out loud.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.280
For crying out loud.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.280
All right.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.280
So this is a very common phrase of frustration.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.280
Yep.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.280
Right.

07:20.280 --> 07:25.280
So why don't we listen to some examples to kind of understand how we use this phrase.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.280
Example one.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.280
For crying out loud.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.280
When I tell you to have the report done by Wednesday,

07:31.280 --> 07:36.280
that means I expect it to be on my desk by the end of the day.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.280
Example two.

07:39.280 --> 07:44.280
We've got to figure out a new marketing strategy for crying out loud.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.280
Example three.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.280
For crying out loud, you just got your driving license

07:50.280 --> 07:53.280
and you already got in an accident.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.280
So it kind of reminds me of, oh my God.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.280
So you're frustrated just saying this phrase as, oh my God,

07:59.280 --> 08:00.280
or something like this.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.280
Yeah.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.280
Yeah.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.280
This is so annoying.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.280
Exactly.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.280
For crying out loud.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.280
Yep.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.280
All right.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.280
Moving on to our third phrase, how can I put this?

08:10.280 --> 08:11.280
How can I put this?

08:11.280 --> 08:16.280
So the boss asked him a direct question and he said, well, how can I put this?

08:16.280 --> 08:18.280
So we use this phrase.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.280
We want to say something maybe a little bit more indirectly.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.280
Right.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.280
So you're looking for words of how you can make it softer or more polite.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.280
Yep.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.280
Maybe the truth or what you're about to say is a little bit strong.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.280
So you want to soften it up a bit.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.280
Yeah.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.280
Okay.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.280
So you say, how can I put this?

08:35.280 --> 08:40.280
But then you have to compliment it with, let's just say that.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.280
Let's just say that.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.280
Let's just say that.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.280
So how do we use this phrase?

08:46.280 --> 08:49.280
So for example, somebody asks me, well, what do you mean?

08:49.280 --> 08:51.280
Why can't you come on vacation with us?

08:51.280 --> 08:54.280
And I would say, hmm, how can I put this?

08:54.280 --> 09:00.280
Let's just say that in nine months you will hear the bitter pattern of little feet.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.280
Okay.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.280
So your girlfriend's pregnant.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.280
Exactly.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.280
So you're trying, you're not saying my girlfriend's pregnant.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.280
You're giving like a metaphor.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.280
A metaphor of what's going on.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.280
But you don't want to say it directly.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.280
Yeah.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.280
Another example.

09:11.280 --> 09:17.280
I might say, let's just say that Michael isn't doing a great job.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.280
All right.

09:18.280 --> 09:22.280
So maybe there are very strong reasons or he's doing very, very poorly.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.280
Right.

09:23.280 --> 09:28.280
But I'm just sort of not saying it exactly directly that he's doing bad.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.280
Okay.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.280
Very good.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.280
So it's a phrase that you can actually use a lot.

09:32.280 --> 09:36.280
And to be a little bit more polite or a little bit more indirect when you're giving somebody

09:36.280 --> 09:37.280
some bad news.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
Exactly.

09:38.280 --> 09:43.280
To a nice sort of complimenting phrases for delivering bad news.

09:43.280 --> 09:48.280
And why don't we hear them one more time in the dialogue?

09:48.280 --> 09:56.280
Now that we've been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter,

09:56.280 --> 09:58.280
Ed, give us some good news.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.280
How are things looking for us in terms of sales this month?

10:00.280 --> 10:05.280
Oh, well, would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?

10:05.280 --> 10:08.280
Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.280
Well, sir, our sales had dropped.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.280
No plunge.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.280
50% in the past month alone.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.280
We are currently overstocked and overstocked and our profits are falling fast.

10:18.280 --> 10:23.280
The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory or getting rid of our staff.

10:23.280 --> 10:29.280
If we consider redundancies, it costs us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.280
It's a real mess.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.280
You're cutting out loud.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.280
How fast are we losing money?

10:33.280 --> 10:35.280
Um, how can I put this?

10:35.280 --> 10:40.280
Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for chapter 11 and less than three months.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.280
What?

10:41.280 --> 10:42.280
Cheese.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.280
How can this have happened?

10:44.280 --> 10:45.280
So what's the bad news?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.280
Oh, that's the really bad news.

10:47.280 --> 10:52.280
Our suppliers suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty.

10:52.280 --> 10:56.280
We're going to have to recall all items sold in the last quarter and the worst part.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.280
We're going to have to shoulder this cost.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.280
Are you joking?

10:59.280 --> 11:01.280
Get the supplier on the line now.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.280
They have to assume the cost of this mess.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.280
We try that, sir.

11:04.280 --> 11:08.280
The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.280
Oh, we're doomed.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.280
There's some really good news, though.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.280
Really?

11:13.280 --> 11:14.280
Who had?

11:14.280 --> 11:19.280
I got offered a new job.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.280
Alright, great.

11:21.280 --> 11:28.280
So this topic of filing for chapter 11 is actually very recent, very common out because recently

11:28.280 --> 11:32.280
one of the biggest companies filed for chapter 11 in the US.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.280
Yeah, that's right.

11:33.280 --> 11:38.280
But I often get confused by the phrase to file for chapter 11 versus to file for chapter 13.

11:39.280 --> 11:45.280
Alright, so in the United States, the bankruptcy law has different chapters or different sections, right?

11:45.280 --> 11:46.280
Yep.

11:46.280 --> 11:51.280
And chapter 11 is basically for companies that run out of money that go bankrupt.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.280
So they have to declare themselves in bankruptcy.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.280
Yep.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.280
And so they file for chapter 11.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.280
But what about chapter 13?

11:58.280 --> 12:00.280
Chapter 13 is for people.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
Ah, okay.

12:01.280 --> 12:07.280
So people who have large debts, maybe with the car company or the telephone company in the campaign,

12:07.280 --> 12:09.280
they file for chapter 13.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.280
They say, hey, I don't have money.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.280
I can pay.

12:11.280 --> 12:15.280
Alright, so I guess here it's kind of a metaphor again.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.280
You know, this phrase to file for chapter 11 or chapter 13, meaning bankruptcy.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.280
Right.

12:21.280 --> 12:25.280
And people will say personally that they're filing for chapter 11.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.280
Exactly.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.280
Yep.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.280
Right.

12:28.280 --> 12:33.280
So this is an interesting situation because if you file for bankruptcy in some countries, you can go to jail.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.280
Ah, I read recently about this happening in Dubai actually.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
Exactly.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.280
So there is prison for debts.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.280
In the US, you don't go to prison for debts.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.280
Hmm.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.280
But what about, uh, what about in your country's listeners?

12:45.280 --> 12:47.280
What happens when you go into debt in your country?

12:47.280 --> 12:50.280
Or what happens when a company goes into bankruptcy?

12:50.280 --> 12:51.280
Hmm.
