00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
Hello, everyone. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marco.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.600
And I'm Erica.

00:06.600 --> 00:10.900
And today we're going to be bringing you a great lesson that's talking about a bank robbery.

00:10.900 --> 00:17.000
Yes, and this is an important lesson for all of our, you know, future bank robbers out there.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
Yeah, we are going to teach you some words that you would use for planning a a bank robbery,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
but you can apply them to other situations.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Hopefully, yeah, I hope you apply them to other situations.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hopefully, you won't rob a bank. We don't want to be responsible for any crimes you commit.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Yes.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
All right. So why don't we start by looking at some of the vocabulary in vocabulary preview?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
We have one word for you today that you'll hear in the dialogue.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
And it is filling in, filling in, filling in.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
So to fill in for somebody, right?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
That means that you are replacing them.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Yes. So if Marco can't host the show today, maybe Danny will fill in.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Okay. So to take the place of someone.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Exactly.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
All right.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay. So now let's listen to our dialogue.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Let's listen to this bank robbery.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
And let's see what happens.

01:14.000 --> 01:27.000
All right. So this is what we're going to do.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I've carefully mapped this out.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
So don't screw it up.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox will go to the bank wearing these uniforms.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear for when they pick up the money.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Got it.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
No problem boss.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're on another route today.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Don't lose your cool. Just act natural.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
What if they want to call and confirm?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
You let him.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
What?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Don't worry.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
We have the phone's tapped.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
So the call will be patched through to me.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And I'll pretend to be the transport company.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You're so clever boss.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Okay.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Shut up.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Don't get greedy.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Are you ready?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Let's go.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Well, it sounds like a pretty interesting plan.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
It does sound like a plan. Do you think it'll work?

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
I don't know. I guess we'll have to maybe talk a little bit about that later.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Okay.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Let's take a look at the language that we saw in language takeaway.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Language takeaway.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Okay.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
We heard five really great words in this dialogue that I'd like to look at now in language takeaway.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
So let's go to the first one.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
Now we heard the boss say that they got replica cuts of the uniforms.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Right.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Replicas.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Replicas.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Replicas.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So it's this is really easy.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Something that's a replica is a copy.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Exactly.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Right.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
So for example, in Las Vegas,

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
there's a replica of the Eiffel Tower of Paris.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yes.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Actually, I lived in a small city where there was also a replica of the Eiffel Tower.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah. In France.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
That was kind of weird.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Well, there are a lot of replicas.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Even now on the street, maybe you can see replica watches.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Right. That supposedly are Rolex, but they're not.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yep.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
And many, many other things so copies.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yes.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Not the real thing.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
All right.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
So let's take a look at the next word.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Taped.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
We have the phones taped.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
We have the phones tapped.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
So if you tap someone's phone,

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
you do something to the telephone line so that you can hear their conversations.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Right.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And actually, the police do this sometimes.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Right.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
You can see in movies all the time.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah. You connect a wire to the phone so you can listen to the conversation.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Exactly.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
So you tap the telephone.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
So in our dialogue, they tapped the bank's phone.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
You know, he said if they make a call, he will patch the call through.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Yes.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
To him.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yes.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Right.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
So patch through.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Patch a call through.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Patch through.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Now we still use this today.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Like if you call an office, right,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
and you say, oh, can you patch me through to Carol?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Right.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
So can you connect me to another phone line?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Connect me.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Right.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
All right. Now let's take a look at our next words.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Clever.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Yes. The boss is very clever.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
The boss is very clever.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
All right. So if you're clever, you're...

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
You're smart.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
You're really smart.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah. Right. Simple.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
So the boss is quite clever, and this is a clever plan.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Clever plan, exactly.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Now let's take a look at our last word.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Don't be greedy.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Greedy.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Greedy.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Greedy.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
To be greedy is a bad thing.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Right.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You want everything.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
You want everything for you.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Yes.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
So like at lunch today, when you had that cake.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
And I didn't share.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
I was very greedy.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Uh-huh.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yes.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
With food, I am greedy.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
All right.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
So these are some great words, and I think, you know,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
if we listen to the dialogue another time,

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
a little bit more slowly,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
we'll be able to hear them a little bit better.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
All right. So this is what we're going to do.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I've carefully mapped this out.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
So don't screw it up.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Mr. Rabbit, you and Mr. Fox will go into the bank,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
wearing these uniforms.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
when they pick up the money.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Good.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
No problem, boss.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
for Carl and Tom, and say that they're on another route today.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Don't lose your cool.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Just act natural.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
What if they want to call and confirm?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
You let him.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
What?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Don't worry.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
We have the phones tapped,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
so the call will be patched through to me,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
and I'll pretend to be the transport company.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
You're so clever, boss.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Okay.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Shut up.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Only take as much money as you can fit into these bags.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Don't get greedy.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Are you ready?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Let's go.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Okay, so now we understand these words

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
that we talked about in language takeaway.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So now let's take a look at some of these great phrases

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
in fluency builder.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Fluency builder.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
We've got three phrases for you here,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
and these are all phrases you might use

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
when you're planning something.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
So the first one mapped out.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I've carefully mapped this out.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Mapped out to map out.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
So when you map something out, what do you do?

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Well, you literally create a plan.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
You can draw a map of what you're going to do.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
So here is it only for like travel or...

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
No, no, no.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
For example, if we're starting a new project in the company,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
you can map out the project.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
What you're going to do this month, next month, so it's a plan.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
So you draw every step in the plan.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
Okay, so you said, well, I've mapped out this plan for a new project.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Okay, interesting word.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
I think we should hear some examples of how it's used.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Example one.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
So I have the future all mapped out.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Well, you'll get a job as a waiter, then we'll get married

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
and two years later, we'll start having kids.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Example two.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
We're mapping out the marketing plan at the meeting today.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Example three.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
Okay, I've mapped out our trip, and it should take about 10 hours.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
All right, so mapped out.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Really, really clear now.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Let's take a look at our next word.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
All right, so if you've mapped out a plan,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
you don't want to screw it up.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Right, screw it up.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Screw it up.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Or screw up.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yep.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
So just screw something up means that you made a mistake on something.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Or you did something wrong.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
You did it wrong.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yep.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Okay, so for example, if I'm taking an exam and I make a mistake,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I screwed up on the exam.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Exactly.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Or for example, here, when we're recording, Marko and I make mistakes.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
A lot.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Maybe more me than Marko.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
We always screw up.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Exactly.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
So to make a mistake, it's a really informal word, but very, very common.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
And, you know, it sounds really, really natural when people use this.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
All right, so now let's take a look at our last word.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Lose your cool.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Lose your cool.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Don't lose your cool.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
So what is this to lose your cool?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
It's a weird expression.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
It's a weird expression.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
Why don't we just give you an example of a person that loses his or her cool?

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
What do you mean you're not ready to go?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
It's time to go.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
We have to go now.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Now Bonina, we are supposed to leave.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Bonita, now we're sitting here again.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm going to wait for you.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Bonina!

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Okay, so basically you lose your temper.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
You become irritated.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
You lose control of your emotions.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Right.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
So Marko, when you lose your cool, is it always that you get angry?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
You don't always get angry.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Maybe you get irritated or impatient.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Or even nervous?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah, right.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
So basically you're not in control of your emotions.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay, so we've looked at a lot of great phrases, a lot of great words.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
So we can listen to our dialogue now for the third time.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
And then we'll come back and talk about this bank robbery business.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Alright, so this is what we're going to do.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I've carefully mapped this out.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
So don't screw it up.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Grab it.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
You and Mr. Fox will go into the bank wearing these uniforms.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear for when they pick up the money.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Got it.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
No problem, boss.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
on another route today.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Don't lose your cool, just act natural.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
What if they want to call and confirm?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
You let him.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
What?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Don't worry.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
We have the phone's tact.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So the call will be patched through to me.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And I'll pretend to be the transport company.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
You're so clever, boss.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Okay, shut up.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Don't get greedy.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Are you ready?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Let's go.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
So there's a lot of movies about bank robberies, but obviously they happen in real life.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
So this dialogue is actually based on real events, right?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah, this actually happened in real life.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
So it's actually a very creative and non-violent way of robbing a bank.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Okay, so what happened?

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
Basically this guy went to a bank dressed up as one of those security guards that transport

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
the money from the bank to another safe place.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
He had fake credentials or replica credentials.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
So fake ID?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah, he had a replica of the uniform.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Wow.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
And he walked in.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
He took all these bags.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
The him and his partner.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And they took him to the truck and drove off.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
And the bank didn't realize that they had been robbed.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
They thought it was a routine thing.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Three or four hours later, the real security guard shows up.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
They were long, long, and they still can't find them.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Really?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So a very clever plan.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Very clever and very effective, I think.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
They stole over half a million dollars.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Okay, well guys, don't try this at home.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
Don't try this at home, but real life really English, right?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Exactly.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Okay, so come to our website.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Leave your questions and comments.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Tell us what you think will happen with these guys.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Do you think they'll be successful?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Do you think they'll get caught?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah, they might end up in jail.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Maybe somebody will lose their cool and then get caught, right?

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Well, thanks for listening guys and until next time.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Goodbye.
