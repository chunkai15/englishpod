Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod Happy New Year. My name is Marco and I'm Erica

00:06.400 --> 00:12.800
Happy New Year. Happy New Year Marco. It's December 31st and we are on New Year's Eve.

00:12.800 --> 00:19.520
That's right and since it's New Year's Eve or talking about New Year's resolutions.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.600
Right, in many places it's very common to make a promise for the New Year, something that you will change.

00:25.680 --> 00:31.200
A promise to yourself, to change something and that's what our dialogue is about today.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.520
So why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview for this lesson?

00:36.400 --> 00:41.760
The vocabulary preview. Okay, on vocabulary preview today we only have one word.

00:41.760 --> 00:46.960
Eating habits. Eating habits. Eating habits. So what are eating habits?

00:46.960 --> 00:55.280
The regular way you eat. Right. So if you eat healthy or if you eat lots of unhelpy food,

00:55.600 --> 01:01.520
or even maybe what time you eat, right, if you eat every day a certain time, yeah, eating habits.

01:01.520 --> 01:08.560
Okay, so we're ready to listen to our dialogue today and it's going to be a little bit fast but don't worry about it.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.920
We'll come back and explain all of the key vocabulary after.

01:12.160 --> 01:24.320
So did I tell you about my New Year's resolution?

01:24.320 --> 01:31.680
I've decided to go on a diet. And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

01:31.680 --> 01:40.400
Exactly. I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat. No more chips, no more soda, no more fried food.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.080
Uh-huh. I've heard this on the floor.

01:44.080 --> 01:50.240
But this time, I'm going to stick to it. I really need it. Trust me, Carol.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.760
I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.080
Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

01:56.080 --> 02:08.240
Thanks, honey. That was a great meal. I'm stuffed.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.400
Do we have any chips left?

02:19.520 --> 02:25.120
So Marko, do you think this guy will be successful in changing his eating habits?

02:25.760 --> 02:29.360
Well, I guess he'll never change, but this gives us a great opportunity to look at some

02:29.360 --> 02:32.400
great vocabulary in this lesson in language takeaway.

02:34.160 --> 02:41.920
Language takeaway. Our first word on language takeaway is junk junk junk junk junk.

02:42.960 --> 02:48.400
So junk comes from junk food. Exactly. Unhealthy food. Yeah.

02:48.800 --> 02:56.800
Fries, chips, hamburgers. Yeah, all that junk. All that junk. Okay. Our second word for

02:56.800 --> 03:00.720

03:23.040 --> 03:32.720
Example one. Come on. Have one more piece of cake. Oh, I can't. I'm stuffed.

I can't solve this math problem. Stick to it. I'm sure you'll get it.

06:00.400 --> 06:06.880

07:15.520 --> 07:29.600
third time and we'll come back in a little bit? So did I tell you about my new year's resolution?

07:29.600 --> 07:36.880
I've decided to go on a diet. And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?

07:36.880 --> 07:45.040
Exactly. I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat. No more chips. No more soda. No more

07:45.200 --> 07:52.240

07:52.240 --> 07:58.320
I really need it. Trust me, Carol. I'm going to be a new man in one year's time.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.360

Thanks, honey. That was a great meal. I'm stuffed. Do we have any chips left?

08:24.800 --> 08:29.680
Okay, so New Year's resolutions are really common in popular thing in North America.

08:29.680 --> 08:35.280
It's tradition to make a promise to yourself on New Year's and stick to it throughout the whole year.

08:35.280 --> 08:41.520
Right. But the funny thing is that very few people actually stick to their New Year's resolution.

08:41.520 --> 08:47.360
That's true. The most common ones are, I'm going to quit smoking. Yeah. That never happens. No.

08:47.360 --> 08:54.400
I'm going to go on a diet like this guy. I'm going to quit drinking. Uh-huh. That almost never

08:54.400 --> 09:01.120
happens either on New Year's Eve. I mean, it's a bad time. Come on. And another really common one

09:01.120 --> 09:08.480
is I'm going to join a gym. That's why gym membership sales are so high in January.

09:08.480 --> 09:14.480
Right. Everyone joins a gym in January, but I'm very few people in the gym.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.600
Yeah. So Marko, do you have any of your resolution for this year?

09:17.600 --> 09:24.160
Yes. I have a New Year's resolution and I resolve to continue bringing everyone some great

09:24.240 --> 09:30.640
lessons. Oh, that's that's so good. And I think I can stick to that one. Yes. Well, I do hope that you do

09:30.640 --> 09:36.160
stick to that one, Marko. We will. We will. But today we're out of time. So please go to our website and
