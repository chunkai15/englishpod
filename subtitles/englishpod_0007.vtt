00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Hello English learners and welcome to the English pod, my name is Marco.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.400
And I'm Erica.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.900
Hey Erica, who are you today?

00:08.900 --> 00:13.500
Marco, I am doing really well and I'm really looking forward to today's lesson.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.900
Well, so am I because here at English pod we're giving you real English.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.200
Every day English.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.100
Exactly English that you hear in movies or in TV shows.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.400
This is English people actually use.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.700
So Erica, what is our topic for today?

00:27.700 --> 00:31.200
Well, today we're talking about computer viruses.

00:31.200 --> 00:31.900
Perfect.

00:31.900 --> 00:36.400
So I think it's time for us to take a look at our preview.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.600
Vocabulary preview.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.000
Okay, today we've got two words to preview.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
The first word is virus.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Virus.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Virus.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Virus.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.200
So if your computer has a computer virus, it means your computer is sick, right?

00:53.200 --> 00:59.100
Actually, a computer virus is a program that is designed to harm or to damage your computer.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.100
Oh, I see.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.100
Okay.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.200
Well, thank you for being so technical.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.400
That's the technical explanation.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.700
Okay, let's take a look at our second word for our preview today.

01:09.700 --> 01:14.600
And that would be froze, froze, froze, froze.

01:14.600 --> 01:20.300
So if your computer froze, it means that your computer stopped working.

01:20.400 --> 01:24.400
Your applications or your program stopped working and you just can't do anything.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.700
Your computer is broken.

01:25.700 --> 01:26.500
Okay, great.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.200
So let's listen to our dialogue.

01:28.200 --> 01:33.500
It's going to be a little bit fast, but don't worry if you don't understand everything.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.900
At the end of this podcast, you'll understand everything.

01:37.900 --> 01:38.400
Perfect.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.400
Let's listen.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.000
Great.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
The stupid computer froze again.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.300
That's the third time today.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.800
Hey, Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC?

02:00.800 --> 02:01.900
It's acting up again.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.900
Let's have a virus or something.

02:03.900 --> 02:04.900
Just give me a second.

02:04.900 --> 02:05.900
I'll be right up.

02:05.900 --> 02:20.800
I ran a virus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.600
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.800
I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

02:26.800 --> 02:31.000
Well, you have to make sure there are antivirus software is updated regularly.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.300
Yours wasn't up to date.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.600
That's probably what was causing your problems.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.800
Okay, anything else?

02:36.800 --> 02:39.800
Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.800
Um, yeah, sorry about that.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.200
Well, I completely understand this guy.

02:51.200 --> 02:55.500
When my computer freezes, I kick it and punch it and do everything to it.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.800
Well, I hope you don't punch it too hard, Marco.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.800
Well, it's still working, so it's all right.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.300
Okay.

03:00.300 --> 03:04.300
All right, let's take a look at our language takeaway.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.600
Language takeaway.

03:07.600 --> 03:12.400
In today's language takeaway, we have two words.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.600
The first word for today is infected file.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.600
Infected file.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.600
Infected file.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.600
Infected file.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.600
And what is an infected file?

03:23.600 --> 03:28.600
An infected file is a file in your computer that has a virus in it.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.600
Ah, perfect.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.600
That's really clear.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.100
What is our second word for the language takeaway today?

03:35.100 --> 03:38.600
Our second word is not up to date.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.600
Not up to date.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.100
Not up to date.

03:41.100 --> 03:44.100
And what is it when something is not up to date?

03:44.100 --> 03:48.600
It means it doesn't have all the most recent information.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.100
Okay, perfect.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.600
Now, let's listen to some examples.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.600
Example one.

03:56.600 --> 04:02.600
I need to buy a new computer because mine isn't up to date.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.600
Example two.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.600
I can't find the street.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.600
Are you sure this map is up to date?

04:18.600 --> 04:21.600
Example three.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.600
Sarah has just finished the reports and all the information is up to date.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.600
Okay, that was pretty clear.

04:34.600 --> 04:38.100
You know, you can also use this phrase positively.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.600
You can say up to date.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.600
Okay, for example, we can say this is a new map.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.600
This is the most up to date map.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.600
Exactly.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.600
Or if I bought a new computer, I could say I just got a new computer.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.600
All my software is up to date.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600
Okay, great.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.600
So now let's take a look at some phrases.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.600
And it's time for putting it all together.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
Putting it together.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.600
Okay, so Samuel said a really great phrase.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.600
He said, I'll be right up.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.600
I'll be right up.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.600
I'll be right up.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.600
I'll be right up.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.600
Now, we can use this phrase in a lot of different situations.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.600
So let's listen to some examples.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
Example one.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
Can you help me with my computer?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.600
I'll be right there.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.600
Example two.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600
Come downstairs.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
Dinner is ready.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.600
I'll be right down.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.600
Example three.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
Hurry up.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.600
I need to use the bathroom.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.600
I'll be right out.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.600
Okay, really great and clear examples, right?

05:54.600 --> 05:57.600
Yeah, you know that phrase, I'll be right out.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.600
I used to hear this all the time when I was young.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.600
Really how come?

06:01.600 --> 06:04.600
Well, I have two sisters and we were always fighting for the bathroom.

06:04.600 --> 06:08.600
So someone was always saying, just a minute, I'll be right out.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.600
Ah, yes, that's common.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.600
I had that too when I was young.

06:12.600 --> 06:16.600
Okay, now our second phrase is, it turns out that.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
It turns out that.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.600
It turns out that.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.600
It turns out that.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.600
This is a great phrase.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.600
You can use it in many different situations.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
Marco, can you give us an example?

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
Sure.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.600
For example, I can say Frank didn't come to work today

06:31.600 --> 06:34.600
and it turns out that he was sick.

06:34.600 --> 06:39.600
Yup, or I could say, oh, I've been feeling really sick recently.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.600
Why?

06:40.600 --> 06:43.600
It turns out that I'm pregnant.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.600
Oh my god, are you really pregnant?

06:45.600 --> 06:46.600
No, I'm not.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.600
I'm kidding.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.600
Alright, because, okay, so it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.600
But this time it'll be a little bit slower.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.600
Alright.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.600
Oh, great.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.600
This stupid computer froze again.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.600
That's the third time today.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.600
Hey, Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC?

07:11.600 --> 07:13.600
It's acting up again.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.600
It must have a virus or something.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.600
Just give me a second.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
I'll be right up.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.600
I ran a virus scan on your computer

07:26.600 --> 07:30.600
and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files.

07:30.600 --> 07:34.600
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.600
I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

07:38.600 --> 07:44.600
Well, you have to make sure that your antivirus software is updated regularly.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.600
Yours wasn't up to date.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.600
That's probably what was causing your problems.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.600
Okay.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.600
Anything else?

07:54.600 --> 07:58.600
Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.600
Oh, yeah.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.600
Sorry about that.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.600
Okay, that was a lot more clear this time.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.600
Definitely.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.600
Yeah, I understood a lot more.

08:10.600 --> 08:14.600
Okay, so now it's time to look at Fluency Builder.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.600
Erika, why don't you explain what Fluency Builder is?

08:17.600 --> 08:22.600
In Fluency Builder, we give you some great, useful phrases

08:22.600 --> 08:25.600
to help you express your ideas clearly.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
Okay, great.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.600
So let's look at Fluency Builder.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.600
Fluency Builder.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.600
Okay, so in this dialogue, we know his computer wasn't working.

08:35.600 --> 08:42.600
Right, so many students would probably say his computer was acting strangely.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.600
His computer isn't working properly.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.600
Exactly.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.600
And that's perfect and that's fine.

08:48.600 --> 08:53.600
Yeah, but there's a really great way to say it that we heard in the dialogue.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.600
It's acting up again.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.600
It's acting up again.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.600
I love this phrase.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
It's acting up.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.600
Yeah, it sounds really natural.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.600
It sounds really natural.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.600
Okay, we're ready to listen to our dialogue a third time.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.600
But this time, it'll be at the normal speed.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.600
Try and see if you can hear these key words.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.600
Great.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.600
The stupid computer for was again.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.600
That's a third time today.

09:34.600 --> 09:39.600
Hey, Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC?

09:39.600 --> 09:40.600
It's acting up again.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.600
Let's have a virus or something.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.600
Just give me a second, I'll be right up.

09:54.600 --> 09:59.600
I ran a virus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.600
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.600
I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.600
Well, you have to make sure that your antivirus software is updated regularly.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.600
Yours wasn't up to date.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.600
That's probably what was causing your problems.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.600
Okay, anything else?

10:15.600 --> 10:18.600
Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.600
Um, yeah, sorry about that.

10:22.600 --> 10:32.600
So, Marco, I really think that my computer actually has a virus now.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.600
Really? How come?

10:33.600 --> 10:39.600
Because I have been turning on my computer and then suddenly it turns off by itself.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.600
It shuts down by itself.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.600
Yeah, that sounds like a virus.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.600
But I ran a virus scan and there was no problem.

10:46.600 --> 10:50.600
Well, maybe your antivirus software isn't up to date.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.600
Yeah, I guess I'd better call Samuel.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.600
Yeah, you can call Samuel to fix it.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.600
All right, folks, we're out of time now.

10:57.600 --> 11:03.600
But be sure to go to our website at EnglishPod.com where you can leave all your questions and comments.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.600
So stay tuned for our next great lesson and until next time, goodbye.
