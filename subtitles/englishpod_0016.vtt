00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Hello English learners, and welcome to English pod, my name's Erica, and I'm here with

00:08.640 --> 00:14.960
Marco! Marco! Hurry up! I'm coming! Hurry up, Marco! We've got a lesson!

00:17.040 --> 00:20.960
Okay, I'm here. I'm here. What did I miss? The lesson.

00:22.080 --> 00:28.000
All right, sorry about that. We have a great lesson for you today. We have an elementary lesson.

00:28.080 --> 00:34.880
That's right, an elementary lesson about being in a rush and about giving directions when you're

00:34.880 --> 00:42.080
in a car. Exactly. We're going to listen to two friends who are getting in a car,

00:42.080 --> 00:48.960
and they're getting ready to go somewhere, and they're in a big hurry. So let's hurry up and listen to the

00:49.040 --> 00:58.160
dialogue. The rea, get in. I'm in, let's go.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.680
Okay, make a left here. No wait, I meant make a right. Come on, speed up.

01:16.320 --> 01:22.880
D's. What's the rush? Don't worry about it, just drive. No, the light is about to change. Step on it.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.880
Are you nuts? I'm not going to run a red light. Whatever, just turn right here. The freeway

01:28.880 --> 01:36.000
will be packed at this hour. Let's take a side street. Go on. Get out of our way. Move! Move!

01:36.880 --> 01:43.840
What's your problem? Geez, having a fit is not going to help. Here, I know a shortcut. Just go

01:43.840 --> 01:49.520
down here and go cut through Ashburn Heights. Let's go. Let's go. Watch out for that lady.

01:50.080 --> 01:58.560
I'm going as fast as I can. Yes, we made it. 558 just before the library closes.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.400
You're such a geek.

02:06.320 --> 02:11.840
So they were in a hurry, and it was all just to get to the library. Well, maybe he was late

02:11.920 --> 02:18.240
returning a book or something. That's a bit dramatic, just for returning a book. Yeah, all right. Why don't we

02:18.240 --> 02:26.080
look at our language takeaway for today? Language takeaway. Okay, on today's language takeaway,

02:26.080 --> 02:31.680
we have five words for you today. Five really important and useful words that we found in our

02:31.680 --> 02:40.160
dialogue. So let's take a look at the first one. Step on it. Step on it. Step on it. Step on it.

02:40.960 --> 02:46.640
So what does it mean when I tell you to step on it? Drive faster. Drive faster, right? Step on it.

02:46.640 --> 02:54.160
Exactly. You might also say speed up. Speed up. Yes. Speed up. That's exactly it. Our

02:54.160 --> 03:02.560
second word, speed up. Also means go faster. Go faster and what about the opposite? You might say

03:02.560 --> 03:11.200
slow down. Slow down. Yeah. Okay, so speed up and slow down. So our third word for today is

03:11.200 --> 03:20.960
having a fit. Having a fit. Having a fit. Having a fit. Well, this is a funny phrase, and I think

03:20.960 --> 03:27.840
listening to a few examples of this phrase might help us understand its meaning a little bit better.

03:28.800 --> 03:38.560
Example one. Geez, you don't need to have a fit. Nothing is going to happen if we're

03:38.560 --> 03:53.840
five minutes late. Example two. My boss is going to have a fit if I don't finish this on time.

03:58.800 --> 04:07.280
Example three. I almost had a fit when my boss told me I had to work this weekend.

04:10.320 --> 04:16.400
Okay, great examples. So Erica, why don't you tell me what does it mean when you have a fit?

04:16.400 --> 04:25.280
It means you get really angry and you can't control your emotions. So maybe you start screaming

04:25.360 --> 04:32.000
and maybe some steam comes out of your ears. Okay, that's having a fit. Exactly. Excellent.

04:32.560 --> 04:39.360
Okay, let's take a look at our next word now. Cut through. Cut through. Cut through.

04:40.080 --> 04:45.840
When you cut through something, it means you just go through. Go through. Yeah, quite simple. It gives

04:45.840 --> 04:52.800
you the idea that you go through something quickly. Quickly, so I can say let's cut through the park.

04:53.120 --> 05:02.400
Yep, or let's cut through the backyard. Okay, go through. And this takes us to our last word for

05:02.400 --> 05:12.000
today. Short cut. Short cut. Short cut. Short cut. This is a really common word and not many people

05:12.000 --> 05:16.880
know about it. Yeah, you're right. It's two simple words that when you fit them together,

05:16.880 --> 05:21.600
the meaning changes. It's a great example of this real English we talk about.

05:21.920 --> 05:28.240
And it means to take a shorter way somewhere. Exactly. So if I take a short cut,

05:28.240 --> 05:34.400
I go the short way. Okay, so going back just a little bit to cut through. If I cut through the

05:34.400 --> 05:41.440
park, that's basically a short cut. Exactly. All right, that's clear. Okay. Now it's time to listen

05:41.440 --> 05:46.800
to our dialogue again. But this time it's going to be slower. So then we can understand all these words

05:46.880 --> 06:01.040
that we just talked about. Hurry up, get in. I'm in. Let's go. Okay, make a left here.

06:02.160 --> 06:13.200
No, wait, I meant make a right. Come on, speed up. Jeez, what's the rush? Don't worry about it.

06:13.280 --> 06:24.080
Just drive. Oh, no. The light is about to change. Step on it. Are you nuts? I'm not going to run a

06:24.080 --> 06:34.160
red light. Whatever. Just turn right here. The freeway will be packed at this hour. Let's take a side

06:34.160 --> 06:46.800
street. Gone. Get out of our way. Move. Move. What's your problem? Jeez, having a fit is not going

06:46.800 --> 06:56.080
to help. Here. I know a short cut. Just go down here and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights. Let's go.

06:56.080 --> 07:03.920
Let's go. Watch out for that lady. I'm going as fast as I can. Yes. We

07:03.920 --> 07:10.640
made it 558 just before the library closes. You're such a geek.

07:14.880 --> 07:20.720
Okay, well, I think that with a lot more clear this time. You know, there was some great language

07:20.720 --> 07:27.520
in that dialogue and I would like to look at how we can put it together. Put your hands together.

07:29.120 --> 07:33.600
Okay, so today I'm putting it together. We have three phrases for you. And we're going to

07:33.600 --> 07:39.280
show you how you can use these phrases like a native speaker. Okay, so all of these phrases we

07:39.280 --> 07:47.200
heard in the dialogue. Why don't we start with the first one? Make a make a. So in the dialogue,

07:47.200 --> 07:55.520
they say make a left here. Yeah, and we can extend this phrase to say make a right. That would

07:55.520 --> 08:02.240
be the equivalent of saying turn left or turn right. Turn right. And there's one more. Make a

08:02.320 --> 08:10.000
you turn exactly. That means turn the car 180 degrees all the way around. Make a you turn.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.280
So make a left make a right make a you turn. If you're ever in a taxi and you're telling the

08:15.280 --> 08:21.120
taxi driver word ago, this is the perfect way. Make a left here, make a right there. Okay, so let's

08:21.120 --> 08:29.200
move to our second phrase and it is, are you nuts? Are you nuts? Are you nuts? So this is a great

08:29.520 --> 08:37.520
way of saying are you crazy? Are you insane? Are you mad? So when would we use a phrase like this?

08:37.520 --> 08:43.600
If somebody has a bad idea that you don't agree with, you would say are you crazy or are you nuts?

08:43.600 --> 08:50.080
So Marco, let's stop this podcast right now. Are you nuts? Okay, I think that's a good

08:50.080 --> 08:56.400
example of how we can use this phrase. Yes. So are you nuts? Are you insane? Are you mad?

08:57.040 --> 09:07.280
So let's listen to some examples of are you nuts? Example one. You want to get married now?

09:07.840 --> 09:11.040
Are you nuts? You only matter three weeks ago.

09:15.200 --> 09:24.240
Example two. Are you nuts? I'm not going to cheat on the exam. What if I get caught?

09:27.280 --> 09:36.880
So I think that's clear and now we can move to our third phrase, which is, let's take a side street.

09:36.880 --> 09:42.880
Let's take a side street. Let's take a side street. Again, so if you're in a taxi, this is a great

09:42.880 --> 09:49.360
way to suggest a route or suggest a direction. Right. So we can take this phrase and extend it out

09:49.440 --> 09:57.840
with a few more words. We might say, let's take Wilson Avenue. Right, or let's take the highway.

09:57.840 --> 10:04.160
So let's take a side street. Let's take Wilson Avenue. Let's take the freeway. Okay, so now,

10:04.160 --> 10:10.880
let's take a listen to this dialogue a third time at its normal speed. And now you can understand

10:10.880 --> 10:12.560
everything that's in this dialogue.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.560
Hurry up, get in. I'm in. Let's go.

10:34.400 --> 10:40.160
Okay, make a left here. No wait. I meant make a right. Come on, speed up.

10:40.800 --> 10:47.360
D's. What's the rush? Don't worry about it. Just drive. No, the light is about to change. Step on it.

10:47.440 --> 10:53.280
Are you nuts? I'm not going to run a red light. Whatever. Just turn right here. The freeway

10:53.280 --> 11:00.400
will be packed at this hour. Let's take a side street. Go on. Get out of our way. Move, move.

11:01.280 --> 11:08.240
What's your problem? Geez, having a fit is not going to help. Here, I know a shortcut. Just go

11:08.240 --> 11:14.080
down here and go cut through Ashburn Heights. Let's go. Let's go. Watch out for that lady.

11:14.480 --> 11:24.880
I'm going as fast as I can. Yes, we made it. 558 just before the library closes. You're such a geek.

11:28.480 --> 11:33.920
Well, this dialogue is all about driving, right? Yes. And in North America, we're both of us

11:33.920 --> 11:40.640
are from. Driving is everything. Everybody has a car. When did you get a car?

11:41.520 --> 11:48.080
I, well, my car I got when I was like maybe 19. Really. But I learned how to drive and I was driving

11:48.080 --> 11:52.800
already by the age of 16. Yeah, that's the thing. In many countries, you have to wait till I think you're

11:52.800 --> 11:59.440
18 to drive. But in North America, everyone has a driver's license by the time they're 16

11:59.440 --> 12:04.880
years old. Yeah, yeah. I guess everything is so far away that you need a car. Yeah, it's a lot

12:04.880 --> 12:10.400
less likely to have subways or trains to travel by North America. All right. So

12:10.400 --> 12:16.640
now you have all the tools necessary to give directions the next time you're in a car or in a taxi.

12:16.640 --> 12:22.880
Well, everyone, I really hope you enjoyed this lesson. Now I want to remind you all to come to our

12:22.880 --> 12:29.840
English pod website at Englishpod.com. And here you'll find a lot of tools to help you understand

12:29.840 --> 12:35.440
our podcasts better. So with that, until next time, this is goodbye.
