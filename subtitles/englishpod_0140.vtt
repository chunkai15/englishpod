00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello English learners. Welcome back to English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
And my name is Katherine. So what are we talking about today Marco?

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Well we're talking about one of my favorite topics which are computers.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Yes, you're a little bit of a nerd.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
A little bit. I love computers and technology and everything that's related to it.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
So that's what we're going to be looking at today. Maybe we're buying a new computer.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Well I anticipate learning something from this because there are a lot of those fancy big words

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
that I don't know that have to do with processors and gigo to go to go.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
So that's going to be coming up in a minute here.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
But first let's just jump right in and take a listen to today's dialogue.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
So can you fix it? I'm sorry sir.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
This computer is not broken or damaged.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
It's simply just too old.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
There really isn't much I can do.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
What do you mean?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
About this computer just three years ago.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay. I know where this is going.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
It has a four gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard, and desk speakers.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I have no idea what you were talking about.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I just want to know if it's good.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
And if I'll be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
If it does, we'll give you your money back.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
All right, we're back.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I think it's a very typical case.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
It's something fixed and they say we can't fix it. You need a new one.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes, and not only a new one, but a bigger and better and faster one.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And more expensive obviously.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Called the upsell.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
The upsell.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
All right, so there were some very difficult words I think because they're very specific related

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
to technology and computers.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
So why don't we look at those now in language takeaway?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Language takeaway.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
All right.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
So the first word we have today is when something is no longer in use.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Okay, so this word is obsolete.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
It's obsolete.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
We're not just talking about like, oh, I haven't touched that pen in like 10 years.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
We're talking about a piece of technology that is no longer useful because there's something else that can do a better job.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Right.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
And actually not only with technology, we also have words that are obsolete, right?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Exactly. Like thigh or thigh.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
You or yours.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Classical English.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
We don't use thigh anymore.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
No, but that art very summary today, Marco.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
The we don't use it anyway. That's obsolete English, right?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
And obsolete words.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Exactly.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
So obsolete means it's no longer of use.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
We have better and newer things in its place.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
All right.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
And now moving on when the salesman was describing the characteristics of the computer,

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
he had he used some prefixes that were a little bit strange, right?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Like for example, Giga.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Giga?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Giga?

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
All right. So these are actually prefixes that have to do with numbers.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And so this is not just a computer thing.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
This is a math thing or science thing.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Okay. So we've got three different prefixes.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
A prefix is something we tack on at the beginning of a word.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
So with that, we have hurts or bite, right?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
These are little bits of the computer bite.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Right.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Mega bites.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Mega bites we've all heard before.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
That's smallest here.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
We've got Mega bites, but bigger than Mega.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
We've got Giga bites.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
A giga.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
So now, for example, the hard drives are 250 gigabytes.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
You might even hear someone say gigs.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
We've got a gig.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
250 gig hard drives.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
But what's bigger than Giga?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Now it's the terabyte.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Oh, tera sounds like boom, boom.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, I actually wondered what would happen after a gig

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
bite because it's so much informational already.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
And now it's the terabyte.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
So it's like 1,000 gigabytes.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
So that's like 200 movies.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
That's probably more than that.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's amazing the amount of storage you can have.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And how small it actually is.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
So Mega, giga, tera.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Right.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Going from littleist to biggest.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
All right.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
And well, he described four giga hurts processor.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Mm.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Okay.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
So the processor is our next word.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
And this is actually something that determines how fast your computer

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
is going to run.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So it comes from the word to process, right?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Right.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
To like calculate or to think do even to do.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
So you have different examples like a word processor.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Right.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
So it's like Microsoft Word.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It allows you to make word documents.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Mm.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You can also say to process that up.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
You're trying to calculate it.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Mm.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
But in this case, a processor is like a little brain.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So that's the center of the computer.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And that's where all the information gets processed.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So it's the brain at the computer, essentially.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And the bigger it is, the faster it can go.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Exactly.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
And well, if you don't have a very good processor, your computer is bound to freeze.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Okay.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
So freezing is another key word.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Especially when I'm at computers, this one drives me nuts.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
To freeze, it means to stop moving.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Right.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Right.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, a couple of different meanings.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
You might have heard it about ice before.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
But to freeze here, we're talking about stopping moving.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So we have a game called freeze tag.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Mm.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Or if I touch you, you have to stop running.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Right.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
But here we're talking about a computer freezing.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I'm moving my mouse.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
And I'm typing.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
And all of a sudden.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
It doesn't work.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
My mouse doesn't move.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
I can't close or open or do anything.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And it's really frustrating.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Especially if you're doing something and you didn't say your work.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
It's not on.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Ah.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Right.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
If your computer freeze is then usually you have to restart it or turn off or not.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
So that is about it for those words.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
But let's take another listen and slow the dialogue down this time so you can catch some

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
of those big words.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
So can you fix it?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm sorry, sir.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
This computer is not broken or damaged.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
It's simply just too old.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
There really isn't much I can do.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
What do you mean?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
About this computer just three years ago.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Okay.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I know where this is going.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
It has a four gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard, and desk speakers.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I just want to know if it's good.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
And if I'll be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
This PC is top of the line.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And I guarantee it will never freeze.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
If it does, we'll give you your money back.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Fritz, so we are back.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
So now let's jump into today's Fluency Builder.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Fluency Builder.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
All right.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
So on Fluency Builder, we're going to take a look at three different phrases.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
For example, the salesman was describing technology and said that it's ever changing.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
So this is a sort of poetic line here.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
So ever changing means always changing.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Always.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Always changing.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
And so we can say that the ocean is ever changing.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
You know, the waves are always changing.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
But in this case, he's saying that technology is always changing.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
It's always progressing into something new.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
So exactly.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
That is a key selling point for this guy.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Right.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So this is actually a very interesting word.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
We can use it like in your example beyond technology.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Like the way like the sea is ever changing.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
So why don't we listen to a couple of other examples.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Example one.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
There's all this something new in this ever changing both.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Example two.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
Times are ever changing and we must prepare ourselves better every day.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Example three.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
The flu is an ever changing virus that continues to claim many lives.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
All right.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
We're back.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
So now we understand the ever changing.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
So the man who's trying to buy this computer.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh, at least get his computer fixed.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Really?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
It starts to get frustrated with the salesman and he says,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Okay.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I know where this is going.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So he hears the sales pitch.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
He hears this guy trying to loosen him up a little bit.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
He says, I know where this is going.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
So what does this mean?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Where something is going?

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
So basically what direction a conversation or a topic or a situation is taking?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Okay.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
So he's saying, I know why you're telling me these things.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Right.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I know you're motive.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
All right.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Know what's happening.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I know what you're going to say.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Okay.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
So he's essentially saying, I know you're going to try and sell me a computer.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Right.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
You can use it in other circumstances, right?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
For example, their relationship.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I don't know where this is going.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Right. What is going?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Classic breakup line.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I just don't think I know where this is going anymore.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
So in reference to the relationship, right?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yes.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
We don't know what's happening.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Are we serious?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Or are we maybe going to get married?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I don't know anyone.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I can't tell where this movie is going.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
It's so like, oh, that here and there and boring.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
I don't know the plot.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
All right.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So it's a very common phrase and it sounds very natural when you say it.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
It does.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
And that's why it's an influencer build.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
There really helps you sound like a more native English speaker when you use these kind of phrases.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
And the next one is also very, very good when he describes the condition of the computer.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
He says it's top of the line.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Top of the line.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Now what line we're talking about?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I do not know.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
But this is above average line.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Right. So this is the best of the best.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
This is the top model or the top computer.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
And you can definitely imagine a car salesman using this.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Yes.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
This BMW is top line.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
The best money can buy.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
That's another good one.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
So basically top of the line is the best of the best.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
The above average, right?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
More than above average.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
It's really, it's the best you can do.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
And so the guy is saying, listen, this is our best computer.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Really, you should buy it.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And obviously you have the line.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
It's like, that's a lot of money.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Yeah.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
It's usually for for something that costs money, right?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Things.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
You wouldn't really use it for a person, right?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
He's top of the line.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Top of the line.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
I think generally refers to electronics and cars or motorcycles.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
And so you often hear top line stereo, top line TV, top of the line car.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
But you wouldn't say this about food or people or art.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah. You wouldn't say this painting is top of the line.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Not about very unique things.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
You'd say this about kind of manufactured things.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Very good.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Why don't we listen to where

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
before the last time and then we'll come back?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
So can you fix it?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I'm sorry, sir.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
This computer is not broken or damaged.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
It's simply just too old.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
That's why your programs and applications are running slow.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
There really isn't much I can do.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
What do you mean?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
I bought this computer just three years ago.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Yes, but technology is ever changing.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
And technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Okay. I know where this is going.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
How much will it cost me to get a new computer?

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Well, this desktop over here is our latest model.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
It has a four gigahertz processor with 16 gigabytes in RAM

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
and a hard disk with one terabyte.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard, and desk speakers.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I have no idea what you were talking about.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I just want to know if it's good.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
And if I'll be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
If it does, we'll give you your money back.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
All right, we're back.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
So computers, Catherine, I know you recently got a nice macintosh.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, yeah, I did.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It's one of those big screen ones, right?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, it is. It's a desktop, right? So it's not a laptop.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
And it's got a very fast processor because Max started using Intel processors

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
a couple of years ago and that made them much faster.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Wow, and it has this processor actually has two cores, right?

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
So basically, it has two different brains almost within one processor.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Which gives it really bad headaches. She complains to me often.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Are you a big Mac fan or PC fan?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
I'm a Mac fan.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
I've been converted. My roommate in college, my sophomore year had a Mac.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
And ever since then, I've really gotten into them. So really.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I went Mac and didn't turn back.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
I still honestly cannot really use a Mac.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
I get confused. I'm looking for the start button and I'm looking for where my documents are.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
It's really hard to change over, right?

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
But once you do, you don't want to change back because everything is so much easier on a Mac.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Really?

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
If you're really into PC gaming, then you should probably stick with it.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Stick with the PCs because the games just don't really compare on Macs.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
But I've heard that also, Max don't really suffer from viruses, right?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
No, they don't, which is great.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Because I always used to get these viruses that was slow down my computer.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
Because you know, you open some email and also, there's nastyness on your desktop.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Well, now I don't really have that problem.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
And also, there's really wonderful photo editing software and video editing software.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
So everything is just really easy to find and easy to use.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
What about you, listeners? Do you prefer the Mac?

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
Do you prefer the PC or maybe some of our listeners don't really even like computers?

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, let us know either way we're very curious to hear what you have to say.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
And of course, writing on our comment section is great practice for your English.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Right, so we'll see you guys there.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Until next time.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Bye, everyone.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Thanks for watching.
