Hello everyone, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod, my name is Marco

00:08.200 --> 00:12.680
My name is Katherine and that's us and that's us and today we're going to talk about

00:12.680 --> 00:16.680
a very common situation when you when you're a couple when you have girls

00:16.680 --> 00:23.680
Honey, come on. I want to go. Are you you're taking forever? All right, who takes

00:23.680 --> 00:28.360
long? Like, do you take a long time to get ready to get dressed? Okay, I take longer to get

00:28.360 --> 00:34.840
ready, but my boyfriend takes longer in general because he's like checking his email, playing

00:34.840 --> 00:41.920
video games, like just, you know, we call it Lolly gagging. He's just like being kind of slow.

00:41.920 --> 00:49.120
I'm the opposite. I usually, I usually start getting ready later. Like, if we have to leave

00:49.120 --> 00:53.680
at nine, I'll start getting ready at eight thirty, but I'll be ready by nine because I take

00:53.680 --> 00:56.960
a shower real fast, get dressed and I know what I'm going to wear and all my clothes are

00:56.960 --> 01:01.400
ready. But on the other hand, my girlfriend takes forever to get ready and she's like,

01:01.400 --> 01:08.600
oh, and then, you know, the hair. Girls have makeup and tights. But this is what I understand.

01:08.600 --> 01:13.840
If we're supposed to leave at nine, why don't you start getting ready before? Never underestimate

01:13.840 --> 01:18.400
me. I don't know. For a crass denation. Hey, it's not even about procrastination. Sometimes

01:18.400 --> 01:23.240
it just takes longer to look good than other times. Right. Well, in this case, we're going

01:23.240 --> 01:28.480
to be looking at a lesson where it's the opposite. The husband is taking a long time

01:28.480 --> 01:34.280
to get ready and well, I don't think he has a very good fashion sense, right? He does not.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.480
I'm going to learn what that phrase means in a minute here, but before we get going,

01:37.480 --> 01:41.400
I've got a couple of words to preview to help you understand what's going on in today's

01:41.400 --> 01:48.800
dialogue. Very cablory preview. All right. So, vocabulary preview today. We have two words.

01:48.840 --> 01:57.320
The first one can be a noun or a verb to iron or iron. So, two iron basically means

01:57.320 --> 02:04.920
to get the wrinkles out of clothes. And so, we use this iron is actually a metal. It's

02:04.920 --> 02:11.920
a very important metal. And an iron is a machine that we plug in. We use it to get the

02:11.920 --> 02:16.440
wrinkles, the lines out of our shirts and our skirts and everything. And so, it's actually

02:16.680 --> 02:20.040
very important thing to make sure that you look nice and put together. Right. So, you use

02:20.040 --> 02:26.360
an iron, two iron, your shirt or two iron, your skirt. And then we have sandals. My favorite

02:26.360 --> 02:31.400
type of shoe. Mine too. Sandals. I have a friend who used to say she had claustrophobic feet.

02:31.400 --> 02:37.680
Her feet didn't like to be enclosed spaces. So, she only wore sandals. So, these are open shoes,

02:37.680 --> 02:41.960
open toe shoes, basically. You wear them at the beach. Or you wear them in the summer in

02:41.960 --> 02:46.000
general. I'm wearing sandals right now. And you have different types of sandals like sandals

02:46.040 --> 02:49.240
and flip flops, right? Flip flops. I think they're called that because they sound like

02:49.240 --> 02:54.280
flip flops. Flip flops when you walk. All right. So, those are two words today. Let's

02:54.280 --> 02:57.640
listen to the dialogue for the first time. And then we'll be back.

03:05.280 --> 03:09.080
Honey, come on. We're going to be late. Honestly, you take long and getting ready the

03:09.080 --> 03:14.880
night, too. I was drawing my hair and ironing my shirt. Can you come here for a sec? I need

03:14.960 --> 03:20.960
your help. What is it? Why are all these clothes on the bed? I don't know what to wear.

03:20.960 --> 03:26.000
Okay. Give me your opinion. Do you like the way this looks? The strap short sleeve shirt

03:26.000 --> 03:30.560
with this checkered sweater. My lucky sandals. I like the cut and hemline of these shorts.

03:30.560 --> 03:35.680
So, I think I'll wear these as well. Are you joking? But am I going to do with you? You're

03:35.680 --> 03:40.560
going to a dinner party, not to the beach. Wear a shirt with a satire bought you and there's

03:40.640 --> 03:46.320
Cordray pants. It's on the outside, so you can wear this coat. Flags, honey. You have such a great

03:46.320 --> 03:49.200
fashion sense. Now, what am I going to do with my hair?

03:54.400 --> 04:00.000
All right. We're back. So, um, interesting. This has been sound to the lot like a famous president,

04:00.000 --> 04:05.760
I think. He did, but we'll get to that in a minute. Before we do talk about who this guy is,

04:05.760 --> 04:10.320
I think it'd be a great idea to talk about some of these clothing terms because they're very useful

04:10.320 --> 04:16.320
for when you want to go shopping and for when you're getting dressed. Language takeaway.

04:18.560 --> 04:23.920
Okay. So, the first word that we have on language takeaway is stripeet. All right. You might have

04:23.920 --> 04:31.440
heard that the American flag called stars and stripes. Stripes are those lines on clothing or on flags

04:31.440 --> 04:36.320
that go up or down or left and right. Exactly. So, you have, if you have a striped shirt,

04:36.320 --> 04:39.920
you have many lines on your shirt that are going up and down or left and right. Right.

04:39.920 --> 04:45.040
And I say with fashion, lines that go left to right make you look better and lines that go up and

04:45.040 --> 04:51.360
down make you look thinner and taller and taller. Very good. And now moving on, if it's summer

04:51.360 --> 04:56.880
and you want to wear a shirt, you can wear a short sleeve to shirt. All right. This is important.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.120
So, most people like to wear short sleeve shirts in the summer time because they're cooler.

05:01.920 --> 05:06.960
And in the winter time, that means we like to wear long sleeve shirts. Okay. So, the sleeves are

05:07.040 --> 05:14.080
basically the arms of the shirt. Exactly. You say short sleeve. Very good. And then we have a

05:14.080 --> 05:18.480
checkered shirt or a checkered sweater in this case. Okay. So, checkered means there are

05:19.760 --> 05:24.800
little squares on the shirt and usually one square is one color and the next square is another color.

05:24.800 --> 05:31.280
So, it looks like a checkered board. Very good. Like a chest board. Exactly. And so, in this case,

05:31.280 --> 05:38.720
we've got a guy who's trying to wear a striped shirt and a checkered sweater. That does not go

05:38.720 --> 05:46.320
well to the right. No. Too much stuff happening. Too busy. Too busy. All right. And not only that,

05:46.320 --> 05:54.400
but he wanted to wear shorts because he liked the cuts and the headline. Okay. These are actually

05:54.400 --> 06:00.320
terms that we normally use with women's clothing because you could say I like the cut of this dress.

06:00.320 --> 06:05.840
I like the the shape that it has. Very good. And hemline is the bottom of your skirt or your

06:05.840 --> 06:12.240
trousers or your shorts. And hemline we could say my mother used to say this to me. The hemline is much

06:12.240 --> 06:18.480
too high. Must be short. That skirt is not appropriate. Yeah. So, it's nice to have a hemline at the knee.

06:19.920 --> 06:25.920
All right. So, the cut is the shape that the piece of clothing has like pants or skirts.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.960
And the hemline would be the place where it ends, right? The skirt, for example. Like it

06:30.960 --> 06:38.880
pretty much tells you the length of something. Very good. And now, well, and now the wife steps in.

06:38.880 --> 06:43.680
She's like, no, you're not wearing this. She's telling you that she has to wear nice clothes.

06:43.680 --> 06:50.560
And among those items is a silk tie. Okay. So, classic father's day gift. silk tie. I've given

06:50.640 --> 06:56.880
this one a couple of times. A silk tie is a, you know, a neck tie along neck tie that's made of silk.

06:56.880 --> 07:01.840
Silk is a very soft material, right? Very expensive as well. It can be especially Italian silk.

07:02.720 --> 07:07.600
And I've always actually wanted to have silk sheets. Oh, see, I don't know. I feel like they

07:07.600 --> 07:12.000
would get very warm in the summer. Yeah. Well, in the winter it would be awesome, but probably very

07:12.000 --> 07:17.440
cold in the winter as well. Yeah, I don't know. Well, it's one of those things. And then

07:17.520 --> 07:23.840
she's also telling them to wear some corduroy pants. Okay. So, it sounds like this might be a winter

07:23.840 --> 07:28.400
dialogue because corduroy is not something you wear in the summer because it's very heavy and thick.

07:29.120 --> 07:37.120
Corduroy actually is a fabric that that usually has these kind of ribs or or ridges. And so there's

07:37.120 --> 07:42.640
like little lines in the fabric that make it quite thick and rough when you're almost not rough.

07:42.640 --> 07:48.560
But they make it feel very unique when you touch it. Yeah, it's not smooth. It's a little bit rough.

07:48.560 --> 07:54.640
The fabric. Very good. So those are all the the clothing items that we've looked at today. There's

07:54.640 --> 07:58.880
a lot of them. And obviously we'll post a couple of pictures on on the side so you can see

08:00.080 --> 08:05.040
so you can see better what a silk tie looks like or especially corduroy pants corduroy. Yeah.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.280
All right. So let's listen to this dialogue. Again, we're going to slow it down a little bit and

08:09.280 --> 08:19.200
then we'll come back and look at some of the phrases. Honey, come on. We're going to be late.

08:19.200 --> 08:24.640
Honestly, you take longer getting really than I do. I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

08:24.640 --> 08:30.400
Can you come here for a sec? I need your help. What is it? Why are all these clothes on the bed?

08:30.400 --> 08:35.520
I don't know what to wear. Okay. Give me your opinion. Do you like the way this looks?

08:35.600 --> 08:40.320
The strap short sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater. My lucky sandals. I like the cut and

08:40.320 --> 08:45.440
hemline of these shorts. So I think I'll wear these as well. Are you joking? What am I going to

08:45.440 --> 08:50.320
do with you? We are going to dinner party not to the beach. We're going to show it with a

08:50.320 --> 08:55.360
set of tie-up or you and those corduroy pants. It's chilly outside so you can wear this coat.

08:55.360 --> 09:00.320
Thanks, honey. You have such a great fashion sense. Now, what am I going to do with my hair?

09:00.480 --> 09:09.920
All right. We're back. So now let's start with fluency builder. Fluency builder.

09:09.920 --> 09:16.240
Okay. These are classic couple phrases. These are phrases you hear among couples. And the first one

09:16.240 --> 09:23.920
is maybe more common to hear from the female end, but it's not unknown on the male end. So

09:23.920 --> 09:30.240
we have this question. Do you like the way this looks? So while the person is saying

09:30.240 --> 09:35.840
this, they would maybe be moving to the side a little bit like modeling it. Do you like the way

09:35.840 --> 09:41.440
this looks? So basically you're saying, do you like what I'm wearing? Does it look good on you?

09:41.440 --> 09:46.240
Does it look good? Exactly. You could also say, hey, I like the way this looks when you're

09:46.240 --> 09:51.360
trying to buy something at the store. And so do you like the way this looks is a way for you to ask

09:51.360 --> 09:57.360
the other person's opinion of how you look? And also another common phrase, especially with men who

09:57.360 --> 10:04.400
have no fashion sense, the wife says, what am I going to do with you? Okay. This is an interesting

10:04.400 --> 10:12.960
phrase and it needs some explanation, I think, because the meaning is, well, this is very difficult.

10:12.960 --> 10:18.240
Right? So you're being difficult or, wow, you need some help from me. I'm going to help you.

10:18.240 --> 10:23.120
Oh, am I going to help you this much or all the time like this? Right, because she's pretty

10:23.120 --> 10:30.080
much saying he has no idea about clothing and fashion. So he's saying to her, what am she saying to him?

10:30.080 --> 10:37.280
What am I going to do with you? I mean, you need so much help. Seriously. All right. So and

10:38.320 --> 10:43.840
and the third phrase that we said with that we saw and we said at the very beginning is fashion sense.

10:43.840 --> 10:48.400
Okay, so this is actually what the man needs help with fashion. He needs help with his fashion

10:48.400 --> 10:55.520
sense because he has zero fashion sense. Right. And this is pretty much a way to say how much someone

10:55.520 --> 11:01.760
knows about fashion or appearances. And so I can say, you know, oh, my friend Kathy, she has amazing

11:01.760 --> 11:07.120
fashion sense. So she always looks good. Right. So combining colors appropriately or wearing the

11:07.120 --> 11:13.040
right types of shoes, with the right types of clothing, etc. Fashion. Or even just being able to

11:13.040 --> 11:18.320
wear things that are good on her or telling other people what's good on them. So fashion sense

11:18.400 --> 11:24.560
is the ability to to identify fashion and look good and make other people look good. All right. Very good.

11:25.280 --> 11:29.840
Let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time. And we'll come back and talk a little bit

11:29.840 --> 11:34.960
more about fashion because it's a very interesting topic.

11:40.960 --> 11:45.280
Honey, come on. We're going to be late. Honestly, you take longer getting what even I do.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.960
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt. Can you come here for a sec? I need your help.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.800
What is it? Why are all these clothes on the bed? I don't know what to wear. Okay, give me your opinion.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.880
Do you like the way this looks? The strap short sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater.

12:02.880 --> 12:08.000
My lucky sandals. I like the cut and hemline of these shorts. So I think I'll wear these as well.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.440
Are you joking? What am I going to do with you? You're going to do an apartment not to the beach.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.600
Where are they shirt with the satin tie I bought you? And there's Cordray pants.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.240
It's on the outside so you can wear this coat.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.960
Thanks honey. You have such great fashion sense. Now, what am I going to do with my hair?

12:31.760 --> 12:36.400
All right, we're back. You lived in Italy for a while. How is it fashion over there? Is it

12:36.400 --> 12:40.880
extreme like we see on the runways because I honestly don't understand fashion?

12:40.960 --> 12:45.040
Well, the thing about runways is that that's not how normal people dress. Well, yeah, that's what I

12:45.040 --> 12:49.680
understand. Why do they have these fashion shows of people don't really buy these types of clothing?

12:49.680 --> 12:54.720
Well, sometimes people like stores, for example, big stores, department stores will buy

12:54.720 --> 12:59.120
fashions off of the runway and they'll kind of change them a little bit so that they're more

12:59.120 --> 13:03.520
appropriate for normal consumption. That means for normal people who want to wear them.

13:04.720 --> 13:10.080
But the runway fashions are actually they're kind of like exaggerations of trends that will happen

13:10.080 --> 13:16.640
in the shopping world, right, in the commercial world. So the things that you see are like

13:16.640 --> 13:23.680
big blown up exaggerations and we take bits and pieces of those in our daily lives to dress up.

13:23.680 --> 13:29.280
So different colors or fabrics or like oftentimes you see kind of military outfits and so that

13:29.280 --> 13:35.520
will translate into military jackets that are very popular one one season. And so Italy definitely

13:35.520 --> 13:41.120
counts as a very fashionable country, but it's not crazy people. Every once in a while you see

13:41.120 --> 13:46.560
some more crazy clothes, but I think Japan is much more crazy. Yeah, actually Asian countries such

13:46.560 --> 13:52.480
as Japan or South Korea, they have very also unique fashion as well, but it's very

13:53.280 --> 13:58.080
extreme to a certain point. And the color combinations they do is like red sneakers with green pants

13:58.080 --> 14:04.320
and like a blue jacket. It's very crazy. Right. And you often see these shoes, you know, we call them

14:04.400 --> 14:10.240
platform shoes. They're it's kind of like you're standing on a brick. And they're you know,

14:10.240 --> 14:14.880
they're seven inches tall. And you see these little girls when these big shoes and I just I'm so

14:14.880 --> 14:19.040
scared when I see them because I feel like they're going to fall over. The other thing is that fashion

14:19.040 --> 14:25.680
is so expensive if you actually want to buy something that's in like an authentic kind of linear

14:25.680 --> 14:31.200
radar or Oscar de la reinta or something like that, it's so expensive. It is, but you know, high fashion

14:31.280 --> 14:37.280
is expensive. Fashion is not. Doesn't have to be. You can you can be fashionable just looking at

14:38.160 --> 14:43.760
different stores and going to secondhand shops and making your own clothes. I mean, it's all about

14:43.760 --> 14:47.920
a sense of personal style and dressing yourself to be unique. Or you can get at the fake market.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.880
Or you can go to the fake market, exactly. All right. That's all the time we have for today, guys. I hope

14:52.880 --> 14:58.320
you enjoyed this lesson. Please come to a website and comment at EnglishPod.com. And if you

14:58.320 --> 15:02.560
have any other suggestions or maybe your own pictures of crazy fashion, you can post where

15:02.560 --> 15:06.880
glad to see them. So we'll see you guys there. Yeah, as Marcos said, hope to see you on the website.

15:06.880 --> 15:17.680
That's about it for today. So goodbye everyone. Bye.
