intermediate lesson. A special lesson about the new president. Right, it's been a

00:14.880 --> 00:20.880
hot topic in the US, the new president elect president Obama. Yes. So today we're

00:20.880 --> 00:25.680
bringing you something that you might see at his inaugural address. That's true.

00:25.840 --> 00:31.680
So Marco, can you explain this word in inaugural address? The inaugural address is the first

00:31.680 --> 00:37.760
speech the president gives at the ceremony when he is officially president. Okay. All right.

00:37.760 --> 00:43.440
So it says first presidential speech. Exactly. Mm-hmm. Great. So let's take a look at some

00:43.440 --> 00:47.520
other words that we're going to find in the dialogue today in vocabulary preview.

00:48.240 --> 00:54.880
Very vocabulary preview. All right. I'm vocabulary preview. Today we have two words. The first one is

00:55.040 --> 01:03.360
Swear in. Swear in. Swear in. Swear in. We'll see this word in its past tense in the dialogue, right?

01:03.360 --> 01:11.680
Swear in. Swear in. So it means. So to swear someone in is to officially give that person a very

01:11.680 --> 01:19.120
important position, usually in government. Yeah. Yeah. And our second word is oath. oath. oath. oath.

01:19.760 --> 01:25.200
oath. oath. And oath goes hand in hand with Swear in, right? That's right. When you swear

01:25.200 --> 01:32.400
someone in, they make an oath. A promise, right? A promise. An official promise to carry out the duties

01:32.400 --> 01:37.840
of that job. Right. So they promise that they will do their job. Okay. Great. So now let's listen to

01:37.840 --> 01:44.160
our dialogue for a first time. Where are we? Well, we're actually watching a news reporter on TV.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.320
She's in Washington and she's going to tell us all about what's happening. Right. So let's listen.

01:49.120 --> 02:05.760
This is Madeline Wright for BCT News reporting live in Washington, D.C., where very shortly

02:05.760 --> 02:10.720
the new president will deliver his inaugural address. Just moments ago, the president was sworn

02:10.720 --> 02:15.840
into office following the United States Constitution, the president's war to announce to faithfully

02:16.160 --> 02:21.280
the office of the presidency. And what exactly is going on now, Madeline? Well, Tom,

02:21.280 --> 02:25.520
true to American tradition, the band has just played Hale to the chief, and the president has

02:25.520 --> 02:30.400
been honored with the 21 guns salute. Now we're waiting for the president to take the stage

02:30.400 --> 02:35.200
and deliver his speech. Tom is like the who's who of the political world here on Capitol Hill,

02:35.200 --> 02:40.640
with dignitaries representing several different countries. What's the mood on the ground like Madeline?

02:40.720 --> 02:45.920
In a word, the mood here is electric. The excitement in the air is palpable. I've never seen a

02:45.920 --> 02:50.800
larger crowd here on Capitol Hill. The audience is shouting crying and embracing each other.

02:51.600 --> 02:56.080
On this, a mood to historic day, you can feel the hope and the excitement in the air.

02:56.800 --> 03:03.120
The 20th of January will go down in history as well. Oh, Tom, it looks like the president is about to begin.

03:03.120 --> 03:22.720
Okay, some technical problems at the inaugural address. Yeah, I certainly hope this doesn't happen.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.480
Well, if it does, you heard it first at English pod.

03:26.560 --> 03:31.200
Predictors of the future here. Okay, let's take a look at language takeaway.

03:32.880 --> 03:39.280
Language takeaway. On language takeaway today, we're bringing you four words. The first word is

03:39.280 --> 03:47.280
deliver deliver. Deliver. Deliver. Like deliver a pizza. No. Let's listen. We got three examples

03:47.280 --> 03:54.640
that will show the meaning of this word. Example one. Who's going to deliver the welcome speech?

03:57.440 --> 04:04.720
Example two. I've been asked to deliver a presentation on the findings of our research project.

04:08.160 --> 04:14.640
Example three. Dr. Rosen is delivering a lecture on macro economics.

04:17.920 --> 04:25.280
Okay, so deliver a speech. Say a speech to say a speech. Yeah. So you wouldn't say say a speech.

04:25.280 --> 04:31.520
You would say deliver a speech. Exactly. Okay. Okay, our second word for language takeaway. The who's who.

04:31.520 --> 04:38.000
The who's who. The who's who. So this is a funny expression. Hey, it's kind of weird.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.240
The who's who is the important people in a particular field, right? Right. So for example,

04:44.240 --> 04:50.480
there was a party last night and the who's who of the film industry was there. Whoa, so all the

04:50.480 --> 04:58.080
important stars. And direct. Yeah. Okay. You could also say the funeral was like a who's who

04:58.560 --> 05:04.480
of the political world. Okay. So all the important political figures were at this funeral. Exactly.

05:04.480 --> 05:12.720
Let's move to our third word. Dignitaries. Dignitaries. Dignitaries. Okay. We have some great

05:12.720 --> 05:17.920
examples. You can understand what this word means. So let's listen. Example one.

05:21.120 --> 05:25.120
Several important dignitaries were present at the opening ceremony including the president of

05:25.120 --> 05:35.920
Brazil, the king of Spain and the pope. Example two. They're going to be a lot of foreign

05:35.920 --> 05:42.480
dignitaries at the dinner. So basically, we can understand that dignitaries are really

05:42.480 --> 05:48.640
important people, right? Right. Important political or religious figures. I see. All right.

05:48.640 --> 05:56.560
Now our last word for language takeaway palpable palpable palpable palpable. When something is

05:56.560 --> 06:03.040
palpable, it's so strong. You can feel it. Okay. So it's a very strong feeling. You can almost touch it.

06:03.040 --> 06:10.160
Yeah. Like the excitement was palpable or the fear was palpable. Okay. Interesting word palpable.

06:10.160 --> 06:14.880
Let's listen to our dialogue again and now let's try and listen to all these words we just talked about.

06:19.200 --> 06:35.200
This is Madeline Wright for BCT News reporting live from Washington, D.C. We're very shortly

06:35.200 --> 06:40.400
the new president will deliver his inaugural address. Just moments ago the president was sworn into

06:40.400 --> 06:45.280
office following the United States Constitution, the president's war and oath to faithfully

06:46.160 --> 06:52.000
the presidency. And what exactly is going on now, Madeline? Well Tom, true to American tradition,

06:52.000 --> 06:56.560
the band has just played Hale to the chief and the president has been honored with the 21 guns

06:56.560 --> 07:01.840
salute. Now we're waiting for the president to take the stage and deliver his speech. Tom is like

07:01.840 --> 07:06.720
the who-two of the political world here on Capitol Hill with dignitaries representing several different

07:06.720 --> 07:12.320
countries. What's the mood on the ground like Madeline? In a word, the mood here is electric.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.880
Excitement in the air is palpable. I've never seen a larger crowd here on Capitol Hill.

07:17.680 --> 07:23.360
The audience is shouting crying and embracing each other. On this, a most historic day,

07:23.360 --> 07:28.960
you can feel the hope and the excitement in the air. In 20th of January, we'll go down in history as

07:28.960 --> 07:36.000
we're, oh Tom, it looks like the president is about to begin. My fellow Americans.

07:36.800 --> 07:50.320
Okay, so if you noticed in our dialogue, we have some really interesting phrases there. Yes.

07:50.320 --> 07:57.760
So I think it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder. Fluency Builder, today we're going

07:57.760 --> 08:02.240
to be looking at three phrases that are very interesting because we can change them a little bit

08:02.240 --> 08:10.400
and form different patterns. Yeah, so the first phrase we have is in a word. In a word. In a word.

08:11.200 --> 08:17.520
In a word. We use this expression when we want to describe something in one word. Right. Pretty

08:17.520 --> 08:22.160
simple. It's really simple. Let's look at the pattern. We've got examples of how you could use this phrase.

08:23.120 --> 08:33.520
Example one. In a word. The situation is serious. Example two.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.400
What's it like there? In a word. It's amazing.

08:43.360 --> 08:51.760
Okay, so in a word, this podcast is awesome. Amazing. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, let's look at our second phrase

08:51.840 --> 09:00.400
today. Go down in history. Go down in history. Go down in history. So this is a really common phrase.

09:00.400 --> 09:05.680
I'm sure you guys have heard it. Yeah, basically something that is really important that everyone

09:05.680 --> 09:11.360
will remember for a very long time. Let's look at this pattern with a few examples. Example one.

09:15.200 --> 09:20.400
This is going to go down in history as the worst disaster the world has ever seen.

09:22.400 --> 09:32.640
Example two. You'll go down in history as the best president we've ever had.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.640
Example three. This day will go down in history.

09:44.800 --> 09:55.280
Okay, so as you can see the pattern is we're using a superlative. That's right, the most, the best, the biggest,

09:55.280 --> 10:02.480
the worst, right? And our final phrase in putting it together is my fellow Americans.

10:02.480 --> 10:08.640
My fellow American. My fellow Americans. So obviously you can change this one up a little bit, hey.

10:08.640 --> 10:17.120
Right, you can say my fellow co-workers. Uh-huh. My fellow citizens. My fellow family members. Yes.

10:18.640 --> 10:25.600
So basically fellow just means like deer. Yeah. In some way. So similar. Similar. Yeah.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.320
So we looked at some great vocabulary and phrases. And now let's talk a little bit about

10:30.320 --> 10:35.920
these American traditions when electing a new president. Yes. Today in the studio we have J.P.

10:35.920 --> 10:41.520
who's joining us. Hi, everyone. Hey, J.P. And he's going to be talking to us about these traditions.

10:41.520 --> 10:46.400
Oh, I am. Okay. Yeah. What are we going to talk about? 21 guns salute. What's that all about?

10:46.960 --> 10:53.520
The 21 guns salute is the military salute where they say, and now we will have the 21 guns salute.

10:53.520 --> 10:59.520
So 21 soldiers are with their rifles. They go, and they all shoot them off the same time.

10:59.520 --> 11:05.200
And they don't know why. I think it's a sign of respect, okay? Yeah, you'd respect those.

11:05.280 --> 11:10.000
Well, I think in Europe they would do a cannon or something. Oh, right.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.800
Can it salute? No, we'll just cannons. Maybe just one cannon. Maybe our European

11:14.800 --> 11:19.920
listeners know the answer to that. Maybe. Okay. And what about this song, Hale, to the chief?

11:19.920 --> 11:24.800
Do you know anything about that? I do not know anything about except that it's a march.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.720
And I think it's Suza. I think John Phillips, who's eroded. And whenever the president

11:28.720 --> 11:31.760
walks into a room, they play that song. Really? Yes. And I played it once.

11:31.760 --> 11:37.760
For president Bush, the first one. I was a drummer. You did. And my marching band had to play that song for him.

11:37.760 --> 11:44.400
Oh my god, you hear like famous. This was back in like 1986 or something. Was that even an election year?

11:44.400 --> 11:49.600
In eight? Yeah. Well, you did play for the president. So you know. Yeah.

11:50.480 --> 11:55.440
So JPD, have any other sort of traditional things that happen when the president becomes the president?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.720
Well, I can tell you that Jimmy Carter, you know, when when he was elected president,

12:00.800 --> 12:06.240
this motorcade was going down Pennsylvania Avenue. And he stopped the car and got out. Really?

12:06.240 --> 12:11.760
What? Yeah. To walk. He wanted to walk down Pennsylvania. He wanted to walk down the, you know,

12:11.760 --> 12:16.720
down the street. To be with the people. Yeah. I think so. And I think it made the, uh,

12:16.720 --> 12:23.600
I think it made the secret service insane. And maybe the car smelled better. So I think that is my

12:23.600 --> 12:29.600
memory of it. I might be confusing with the West Wing, but I'm not too much to, yeah, maybe.

12:29.760 --> 12:34.720
When the president walks, it's a big deal. So JPD, you do anything special for the

12:34.720 --> 12:39.600
inauguration ceremony. You know, I always take the day off to watch. You do. I love watching. I love,

12:39.600 --> 12:46.240
you know, the, uh, I love the swearing in ceremony, the ritual of the, the, the, the, the speech.

12:46.240 --> 12:50.560
All right, everyone. We're out of time. I hope you enjoyed this political lesson. And I hope you

12:50.560 --> 12:54.320
have a happy inauguration day. Happy inauguration, everyone. Yeah. Okay.

12:54.480 --> 13:01.360
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Great. We're definitely going to take the day off to watch it

13:01.360 --> 13:07.680
with JP. And, um, hopefully you guys can too. Well, thanks for listening everyone and until next time.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.680
Goodbye. Bye.
