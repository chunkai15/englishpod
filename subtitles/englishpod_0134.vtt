00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello English learners, welcome back to English Pod, my name is Marco.

00:06.500 --> 00:11.000
And my name is Katherine, so Marco, you've been shopping a lot lately.

00:11.000 --> 00:21.700
I have, and this dialogue, or this lesson today, is one of my favorite pieces of furniture, maybe appliances that I've bought recently, and it's a TV.

00:21.700 --> 00:27.500
All right, so I'd even go for electronics with that one, the electronics department is somewhere you like to hang out.

00:28.500 --> 00:36.500
Well, I mean, I think every guy loves, you know, like a big screen TV and a home theater system, so you just like go deaf after watching.

00:36.500 --> 00:41.500
And why is that? Is bigger really better when it comes to like a 70-inch TV?

00:41.500 --> 00:51.000
Oh, I don't know, I think, yeah, the whole experience of just seeing this movie on this huge TV and like having all the sound and I don't know, it's just something about that.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.500
Or watching a football game with your buddies and you can actually watch it.

00:55.500 --> 01:02.500
Okay, that I can appreciate, but we've got a couple of great words for you. We're going to preview in today's vocabulary preview.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.500
Very vocabulary preview.

01:04.500 --> 01:11.500
Okay, so I'm vocabulary preview today. We're going to be looking at two words. The first one is to appreciate.

01:11.500 --> 01:22.500
All right, so this basically means to like, yeah, you appreciate someone, but in this context to enjoy or take advantage of something.

01:22.500 --> 01:29.500
Maybe you hear this with a couple two people who are fighting and the girl says to the guy, you don't appreciate me.

01:29.500 --> 01:35.500
So he doesn't really care about her in the way that she wants him to or you could say this about a TV, for example,

01:35.500 --> 01:43.500
I can't appreciate my PS3, my great awesome console, my gaming system because my TV is not good enough.

01:43.500 --> 01:50.500
Or big enough, or big enough. So this means that it could be a lot better if I just bought a better TV.

01:50.500 --> 01:56.500
Right, and if you buy a better TV, then you basically are upgrading or to upgrade.

01:56.500 --> 02:01.500
Okay, so this verb to upgrade means to go from something that's okay to something that's better.

02:01.500 --> 02:08.500
Exactly. So in previous lessons, we've seen to get a complimentary upgrade, for example, on a flight or in a hotel.

02:08.500 --> 02:16.500
I like that. Well, you can also get an upgrade on a computer. You say, well, my computer is from 1994. I really need to get an upgrade.

02:16.500 --> 02:25.500
I have for sure. So to upgrade. Now, we're going to be listening to this dialogue for the first time. We're going to be buying a TV. So let's listen.

02:31.500 --> 02:35.500
Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

02:35.500 --> 02:44.500
Honey, I told you already. I can appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my PlayStation 3 on our old TV.

02:44.500 --> 02:52.500
Good afternoon folks. How can I be of service today? I'm looking to upgrade to a newer bigger television set.

02:52.500 --> 02:56.500
You've come to the right place. What size are you looking for?

02:56.500 --> 03:00.500
Just a normal size TV for a living room.

03:00.500 --> 03:09.500
I see. Well, this set here is on sale. It's a 46 inch HT TV screen and it has all the works.

03:09.500 --> 03:19.500
3 HDMI connectors, USB, VGA, and as video ports. It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.500
This is without a doubt.

03:22.500 --> 03:31.500
The complete home theater experience. This is exactly what I need. Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

03:31.500 --> 03:36.500
Honey, I think it's a bit too big. I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

03:36.500 --> 03:44.500
Not to worry. We will deliver and install it in your home. It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.

03:44.500 --> 03:48.500
This is great. How much will this set me back?

03:49.500 --> 03:55.500
Lucky for you. This is the last one we have in stock. So it's half off. I'll take it.

03:59.500 --> 04:08.500
Alright, so I'm going to have to defer to you Marco on some of these words in today's language takeaway because they're all about TV specifics.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.500
Language takeaway.

04:11.500 --> 04:16.500
Alright, the first word that we're going to be looking at is graphics, the graphics level.

04:16.500 --> 04:21.500
Alright, so you might have heard this before with the phrase graphic design or someone who designs images.

04:21.500 --> 04:25.500
But in this case we're talking about graphics so the way things appear on your TV.

04:25.500 --> 04:32.500
So basically the pictures, right? So he wanted to appreciate the graphics of his playstation three better.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
And that's why he wanted a new TV.

04:34.500 --> 04:40.500
Alright, we could say my computer has amazing graphics. It means games are really fun because they look good.

04:40.500 --> 04:48.500
Or this game has amazing graphics. So the game has, you know, places or scenery that looks really, really, really real.

04:48.500 --> 04:56.500
Alright, so graphics. But some kinds of TVs are made to provide those wonderful graphics and those are called HD TV.

04:56.500 --> 05:02.500
Right, an HD TV or that's an acronym for high definition television.

05:02.500 --> 05:09.500
Alright, and I heard some actors and actresses were complaining about HD TV because the picture quality is so good.

05:09.500 --> 05:21.500
But you can see all of the little problems on their face, the little wrinkles and the pimples and the scars. So be careful because one day we're going to be able to see way too much.

05:21.500 --> 05:30.500
Exactly. So on high definition television, that's basically what you get is better definition, better level of graphics.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.500
So more pixels per inch. You can see a lot more clarity.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.500
Right. So an HD TV.

05:35.500 --> 05:41.500
The next thing we're talking about is actually kind of related to the back part of your TV where you plug things in.

05:41.500 --> 05:46.500
Sometimes it's on the sides, sometimes on the back. Well, there are different names for different kinds of plugs.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.500
So today we're going to talk about two of those. One of them is USB.

05:49.500 --> 05:55.500
Right. This TV has a USB port, which basically stands for Universal Serial Bus.

05:55.500 --> 06:01.500
Alright, so a port is a place where you plug something in. Your computer has a lot of ports as well.

06:01.500 --> 06:10.500
But USB is maybe more common for people who have iPods or computers because this is how we normally connect things to our computers.

06:10.500 --> 06:16.500
So in this case, this television, you could connect maybe your iPod and reproduce videos or pictures onto the TV.

06:16.500 --> 06:25.500
Awesome. Or in the second case, we have a DVI port. So DVI, you're going to have to tell me about this one, Marco, because I'm not so sure.

06:25.500 --> 06:34.500
Well, a DVI is basically a digital video input. So basically you can connect your computer to the TV and see what's on your screen.

06:34.500 --> 06:40.500
Nice. And so if you have a bunch of movies stored on your computer, you can just plug it into the TV and watch.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.500
Or you can even navigate the internet on a big screen TV.

06:44.500 --> 06:48.500
Alright. So what are these three HDMI connectors?

06:48.500 --> 06:59.500
Alright. Well, this is a new technology. Basically, you know, how before you used to get your DVD player, your VHS and you had three cables to first sound in one for video.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.500
Yeah, the red, yellow and white cables.

07:01.500 --> 07:08.500
Exactly. So with this new type of cable or technology, with one cable, it takes all the information to the TV.

07:08.500 --> 07:16.500
So just one cable for everything. Oh, nice. Because my problem is I always used to put the wrong cable and the wrong port. So I'd have the red cable and the yellow port.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.500
And then I'd say, where's the video? I can't see all I can do is listen.

07:20.500 --> 07:25.500
It happens. So with this now, it's easy. And well, it even, it's a little bit more organized.

07:25.500 --> 07:34.500
Because I remember I used to have a TV and have, and I had a lot of different things connected to it. It was just this big spider web in the back with on these cables.

07:34.500 --> 07:40.500
So NHDMI high definition multimedia interface connector. And what else do we have?

07:40.500 --> 07:47.500
Well, last thing we're talking about is actually the place to put your TV. So a lot of people now are putting their TVs on walls like paintings.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.500
Because these TVs are so thin. So we call this a wall mount.

07:51.500 --> 07:55.500
So a mount to mount something is also a verb, right?

07:55.500 --> 08:01.500
Yeah, it means to put something up or to hang something up. So many people like to mount their trophies to show off.

08:02.500 --> 08:08.500
Very good. So this is what we're doing with the TV. We're going to mount it on the wall like a painting.

08:08.500 --> 08:21.500
Cool. So those are our words for tank language takeaway. Let's take another listen to today's dialogue. We're going to slow it down this time and really figure out what's going on.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.500
Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

08:25.500 --> 08:34.500
Honey, I told you already. I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my PlayStation 3 on our old TV.

08:34.500 --> 08:38.500
Good afternoon folks. How can I be of service today?

08:38.500 --> 08:42.500
I'm looking to upgrade to a newer bigger television set.

08:42.500 --> 08:46.500
You've come to the right place. What size are you looking for?

08:46.500 --> 08:50.500
Just a normal size TV for a living room.

08:50.500 --> 08:54.500
Let's see. Well, let's set here is on sale.

08:54.500 --> 08:59.500
It's a 46 inch HT TV screen and it has all the works.

08:59.500 --> 09:04.500
3 HDMI connectors, USB, VGA and as video ports.

09:04.500 --> 09:09.500
It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop.

09:09.500 --> 09:14.500
This is without a doubt the complete home theater experience.

09:14.500 --> 09:19.500
This is exactly what I need. Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

09:20.500 --> 09:25.500
Honey, I think it's a bit too big. I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

09:25.500 --> 09:29.500
Not to worry. We will deliver and install it in your home.

09:29.500 --> 09:33.500
It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.

09:33.500 --> 09:37.500
This is great. How much will this set me back?

09:37.500 --> 09:43.500
Lucky for you. This is the last one we have in stock. So it's half off. I'll take it.

09:43.500 --> 09:54.500
Alright, so now we're going to be taking a look at three different phrases that we saw in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
Fluency Builder.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.500
Alright, this first phrase is definitely one that I use a lot.

10:00.500 --> 10:05.500
We can talk about food. We can talk about electronics. We can talk about most different things.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.500
But the phrase here is the works.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.500
He's getting the works.

10:10.500 --> 10:15.500
Alright, that means any option he could get any possibility he wants it all.

10:15.500 --> 10:22.500
Alright, so if you're getting a new car for example, right? You're getting the high definition sound system.

10:22.500 --> 10:26.500
You're getting nice tires, leather seats. You're getting the works.

10:26.500 --> 10:32.500
Alright, or if you're getting a hamburger and you want the works, you're getting it with cheese and lettuce and tomato and pepper and bacon.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
You know, it means every option you're getting it all.

10:35.500 --> 10:41.500
The works. So I think this word is so versatile that we should maybe listen to some more examples.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.500
Example one.

10:44.500 --> 10:51.500
The bridegroom was wearing a morning suit, tap hat, gloves, the works.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.500
Example two.

10:53.500 --> 11:00.500
He spent over $10,000 on his home theater system. He got all the works.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.500
Example three.

11:03.500 --> 11:09.500
I bought a new car with all the works, magnesium rims, custom paint and leather seats.

11:09.500 --> 11:15.500
So now that we've seen the works on the home theater system, he needs to hook it up.

11:15.500 --> 11:19.500
Alright, so this is an important part and a very exciting part of a new purchase.

11:19.500 --> 11:24.500
So when you buy something at the hook it up, that means you have to plug things together.

11:25.500 --> 11:29.500
Okay, so we plug things into the wall for electricity, but also hook up.

11:29.500 --> 11:36.500
Maybe those, those cores you were talking about earlier that HDMI connector, that's called hooking up or connecting.

11:36.500 --> 11:41.500
So you would hook up your DVD player to your television.

11:41.500 --> 11:46.500
Alright, I could ask you, did you hook up those new speakers to your big TV yesterday?

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
Very good, right? So to connect, it's another way of saying to connect.

11:49.500 --> 11:55.500
And finally the big event when you're buying something is the end when you have to actually pay.

11:55.500 --> 11:59.500
And this guy is a little bit worried that the things he wants cost a lot of money.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.500
So he asks a really great question.

12:02.500 --> 12:06.500
Yeah, he said, how much will this set me back?

12:06.500 --> 12:11.500
Okay, this sounds a little weird at first because you could just say, how much will this cost?

12:11.500 --> 12:14.500
But he's speaking in a very colloquial way, very familiar.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.500
And he says, how much will this set me back?

12:16.500 --> 12:17.500
Right.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.500
So how much will this cost me?

12:19.500 --> 12:22.500
So how much am I actually going to spend?

12:22.500 --> 12:25.500
So it's just a different way of saying how much does it cost.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.500
But it's like you say, more colloquial, it's a lot more native like.

12:29.500 --> 12:33.500
Exactly. And so if you're writing your paper, you don't want to write this.

12:33.500 --> 12:41.500
This will set you back $500 in economics, but we'd say this in spoken language and our normal daily lives with friends.

12:41.500 --> 12:46.500
So why don't we listen to a couple more examples of set me back?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.500
Example one.

12:48.500 --> 12:53.500
This unexpected expense is going to set us back a couple thousand dollars.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
Example two.

12:55.500 --> 13:01.500
That fancy dinner at the restaurant last night really set us back.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.500
Example three.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.500
I feel guilty about buying this coat.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.500
It sent me back over $300.

13:12.500 --> 13:17.500
All right, great. So now that we've taken a look at those great phrases and with some good examples.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.500
Why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time?

13:26.500 --> 13:30.500
Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.500
Honey, I told you already.

13:32.500 --> 13:38.500
I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the games on my PlayStation 3 on our old TV.

13:39.500 --> 13:43.500
Good afternoon folks, how can I be of service today?

13:43.500 --> 13:47.500
I'm looking to upgrade to a newer bigger television cell.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
You've come to the right place.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.500
What size are you looking for?

13:51.500 --> 13:54.500
Just a normal size TV for a living room.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
I see.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.500
Well, this set here is on sale.

13:59.500 --> 14:04.500
It's a 46 inch HT TV screen and it has all the works.

14:04.500 --> 14:09.500
Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA, and as video ports.

14:09.500 --> 14:14.500
It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.500
This is without a doubt.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.500
The complete home theater experience.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
This is exactly what I need.

14:21.500 --> 14:25.500
Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?

14:25.500 --> 14:28.500
Honey, I think it's a bit too big.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.500
I don't even think it will fit in our living room.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.500
Not to worry, we will deliver and install it in your home.

14:34.500 --> 14:38.500
It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.500
This is great.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.500
How much will this set in that?

14:42.500 --> 14:44.500
Lucky for you.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.500
This is the last one we have in stock.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
So it's half off.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.500
I'll take it.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.500
Okay, so a big TV, I think.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.500
I don't know, I think it's just a great thing to have at home.

15:00.500 --> 15:05.500
Not to spend too much time in front of the TV, but it's good to sit down and watch a movie.

15:05.500 --> 15:09.500
It's nice because now there are so many different things you can do with it.

15:09.500 --> 15:14.500
You can hook up your computer, you can buy a projector, you can play your PS3 or your Wii.

15:14.500 --> 15:22.500
So I think there's a lot to do and it's just wonderful how great graphics have come in just like the last five years.

15:22.500 --> 15:28.500
What do you think about having a television set, for example, in the bathroom?

15:28.500 --> 15:35.500
I would say it's a really bad idea, but I think if I have a bathtub, I think it'd be really cool.

15:35.500 --> 15:40.500
What about, you know, some people don't have television set in their bedroom?

15:40.500 --> 15:42.500
I agree with this, I agree.

15:42.500 --> 15:49.500
Because I think it's really important that you have peace and quiet in your bedroom because it's kind of like for me it's an important space where I can just relax and be quiet.

15:49.500 --> 15:57.500
And I like reading a lot, so if I have a TV, maybe I'll watch more TV, but I'd much rather read a book before bad.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.500
True.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.500
Yeah, I definitely agree.

15:59.500 --> 16:04.500
But, you know, I've seen people who have that have TVs in their living rooms, in their dining rooms,

16:04.500 --> 16:07.500
even in their kitchen, so they're watching something while they're cooking.

16:07.500 --> 16:14.500
And even in the bathroom, like you say, in a bathtub, well, it's nice, but some of them I've seen in front of the toilet or something like that.

16:14.500 --> 16:21.500
I would say that the one in the kitchen is nice because if you spend a lot of time in the kitchen, you can watch the news while you're cooking or you can actually watch cooking shows and try and practice.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.500
Or it's so popular.

16:22.500 --> 16:32.500
So I guess it depends on the person, it depends on how much you watch TV, but I'm curious to know what our listeners have to say about TVs and big electronics purchases.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.500
Right, so come to our website, english.com.

16:34.500 --> 16:40.500

16:40.500 --> 16:44.500

16:44.500 --> 16:49.500
And of course, send us your suggestions for future lessons we love to know what you're interested in learning about.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.500
