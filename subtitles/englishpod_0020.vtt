00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello everyone and welcome to English Pie, my name's Erica and I'm Marco.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
So, Marco, how are you doing today?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.200
I'm doing great and I'm really looking forward to our lesson because we're going to the

00:13.200 --> 00:14.200
eye doctor today.

00:14.200 --> 00:19.000
Okay, so we've got an elementary lesson about going to the eye doctor.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Yes.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Well, let's get started then with our vocabulary preview.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
The vocabulary preview.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
We have three words today in our vocabulary preview.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
All three words come from our dialogue.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Our first word is...

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Struggle.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Struggle.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Struggle.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Struggle.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
So, Marco, when I struggle to do something, what does that mean?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
It means it's difficult.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
It means that you have a hard time so you can't really do it very quickly.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
So, you have to try really hard.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah, to try really hard.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah, to do something that's difficult.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Yes.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Okay, our next word is...

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Blurry.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Blurry.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Blurry.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Blurry.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
B-L-U-R-R-Y.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Blurry.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Whenever something is blurry, you can't really see it well.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
It's not clear.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Right.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
That's right.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Everything will be blurry.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Mm-hmm.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Okay, and our final word is...

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Prescription.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Prescription.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Prescription.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Often when you go to the doctor and you need some medicine, he writes out a prescription.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Right.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
A little paper that says all the medicine that you need, and then you can go to the drug store and buy it.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Exactly.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Okay, so those three words you'll hear in today's dialogue, and...

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I think it's time we listen to the dialogue.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Hello, Arthur.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
What seems to be the problem?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Very dark.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
We're all...

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I think I might need glasses.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm getting headaches, and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
But I've always had 20, 20 vision.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Hmm, sounds like you might be far-sighted.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Okay, then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Hmm.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
X.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
E.R.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Three.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Uh...

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
First remark.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
And I can't quite make out the other symbol, but I think it's the peace sign.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Wow.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Arthur, yours blind is a bat.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, I know.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
My vision is really blurry at times.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Okay, then head over to the other room and pick out some frames.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, I fill out your prescription.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Thanks, dark.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Well, this guy really has poor vision, hey.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Well, actually, you know what, I've walked into the bathroom.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
The men's bathroom actually instead of the women's bathroom.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And that's not because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
It's because you weren't paying attention.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
That's true.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
Okay, let's take a look today at our language takeaway.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Language takeaway.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
The first word on our language takeaway for today is 2020 Vision.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
2020 Vision.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
2020 Vision.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
If I have 2020 Vision, it means that you have perfect vision.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Which I do not have.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
No, me neither.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
So I usually wear glasses as well.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But yeah, people that have 2020 Vision don't need glasses.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
They can see clearly and perfectly.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
And perfectly.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Next word is far sighted.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Far sighted.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Far sighted.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Far sighted.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
So if I'm far sighted, I can't see very well, right?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
So if you're far sighted, you can't see things that are near.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
So you can see things that are far away.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Right.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
But things that are close are blurry.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Okay.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
The opposite would be near sighted.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And which is you can see things that are close.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, but not far.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Okay.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Far sighted and near sighted.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Okay.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
So our next word is make out.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Make out.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Make out.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Make out.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Make out.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Make out.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
That's kind of a funny little phrase.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
And let's listen to a few examples of this phrase.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
So we can understand how it's used.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Example one.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I can't make out what this says.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
The writing is too small.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Example two.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
If you look carefully, you can almost make out a few of the stars in the sky.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Example three.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Can you see what's written on the sign there?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
No.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I can't quite make it out.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Okay.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
So basically make out is to see clearly.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Exactly.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Make out to see.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Okay.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
And our last word for language takeaway today is blind as a bat.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Blind as a bat.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Blind as a bat.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
So this is a really funny sounding expression.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
One of these weird English idioms.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
It's a really common expression that just means that you can't see.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Exactly.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
So it's not like you actually are blind, right?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
But you just really can't see very well.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Okay.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
All right.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
We saw four great words today in our language takeaway.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Now I think we can listen to our dialogue another time.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But this time it's going to be slower.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
So we can pick up all these great words that we just talked about.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Hello Arthur.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
What seems to be the problem?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Very dark.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Well, I think I might need glasses.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm getting headaches.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
And I really struggle to see things that are far away.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
But I've always had 20, 20 vision.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Sounds like you may be far-sighted.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Okay, then.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Mmm.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Erks.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Mmm.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Er.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Three.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
A question mark.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
And I can't quite make her with the other symbol.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
But I think it's a peace sign.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Wow.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Arthur, yours blind is a bat.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yeah.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I know.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
My vision is really blurry at times.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Okay, then.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Head on over to the other room and pick out some frames.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
While I fill out your prescription.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Thanks, doc.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
All right.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Great stuff under dialogue.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
And with this, we can start now with putting it together.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Put you in together.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
So we saw a couple of useful phrases in this dialogue.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
And I think we can show you how to use these phrases in a few different ways.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Right.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
The first one that we have today is what seems to be.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
So we heard in the dialogue, the doctor said,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
what seems to be the problem.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
We can use the same expression in a number of different ways.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Let's listen.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Example one.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
What seems to be the problem?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Example two.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
What seems to be the matter?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Example three.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
What seems to be the trouble?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Okay.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
So with these examples, we can see how we can use the phrase,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
what seems to be in many different ways.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah, it's a great way of asking what's the problem.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
So now let's take a look at another phrase.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
We heard in the dialogue, the doctor said,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
head on over to the other room.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Right.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And with this phrase head on,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
we can combine it with other prepositions

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
to indicate another place.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Exactly.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Let's hear three examples.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Example one.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Head on in.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Example two.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Head on out.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Example three.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Head on up.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Okay.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
So for example, we can say head on into the house.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It's gonna rain soon.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Or we can say,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
hey guys, let's head on out to the park.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Mm-hmm.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Or I can also say head on up to my room.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I'll be there in a second.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Great.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Those are some cool phrases.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Right.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
And they're really useful.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
and maybe we'll hear them again?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Hello Arthur.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
What seems to be the problem?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Very dark.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
World.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I think I might need glasses.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I'm getting headaches,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
But I've always had 20, 20 vision.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Hmm, sounds like you might be far-sighted.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Okay, then cover your left eye

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and read the chart in front of you.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Hmm.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
X.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
E.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
E.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
E.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Three.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Uh, first you mark.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
And I can't quite make out the other symbol,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
but I think it's the peace sign.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Wow.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Arthur, yours blind is a bat.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Yeah, I know.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
My vision is really blurry at times.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Okay, then.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Head over to the other room

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
and pick out some frames.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Well, I fill out your prescription.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Thanks, Doc.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Okay, so talking about going to the eye doctor today,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I have a question for our listeners.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
A challenge for our listeners.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
What's it called when you can't distinguish colors?

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
So like when you can't tell the difference between red and blue and green.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Right.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
So what is that condition called?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
So there's like a technical term.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
We want the technical term.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
We want the technical term.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
We want the technical term.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
So we'll be looking for it on our comments page

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
and be sure to, if you know the answer, post it at EnglishPod.com.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Also, if you have questions about today's lesson or any other lesson,

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
please come and visit our website and ask us.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah, we hope to see you there,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
but until then, it's goodbye.
