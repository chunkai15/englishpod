00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Hello English learners, welcome back to another show with us here at English Pod, my name is

00:07.600 --> 00:08.600
Marco.

00:08.600 --> 00:09.600
And I'm Erica.

00:09.600 --> 00:14.600
And today we're bringing you another romantic lesson, but a little bit sad as well.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.600
That's right.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.240
Today, unfortunately, our couple is going to be breaking up.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
Right.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.440
So it's a little bit sad today, but it's going to be good because we're going to be teaching

00:24.440 --> 00:29.760
you some great words and phrases that you can use when you are faced in this situation.

00:29.760 --> 00:30.760
Right.

00:30.760 --> 00:36.080
And so we're going to learn some phrases for breaking up and also some phrases for staying

00:36.080 --> 00:37.080
together.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.080
All right.

00:38.080 --> 00:42.080
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and see what happens with our

00:42.080 --> 00:44.080
young couple.

00:44.080 --> 00:59.080
Honey, do you have a second?

00:59.080 --> 01:00.080
Sure.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.080
Are you okay?

01:02.080 --> 01:04.080
You seem a bit worried.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.080
What's on your mind?

01:06.080 --> 01:08.080
We need to talk.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.080
Okay.

01:09.080 --> 01:14.040
I've been thinking and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
What?

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
Why?

01:16.040 --> 01:19.520
I mean, we've had our ups and downs, and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy

01:19.520 --> 01:20.520
together, only.

01:20.520 --> 01:22.160
That's just it.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.160
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.160
It's not you.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.160
It's me.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.120
I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you're a great guy.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.720
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.720
So what are you saying?

01:35.720 --> 01:38.120
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.440
Tim, you are too good for me.

01:41.440 --> 01:46.000
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy, the way that you made

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
me happy.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.280
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'll be a lie.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.880
I know I'd only hurt you.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.000
I know I'd only make you cry.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.400
Baby, don't do this to me.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.040
Whatever it is, we can work it out, just give me another chance.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.760
I know that we can get through this, but we have to stick together.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
Don't leave me.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.760
I can't, Tim.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.800
I hope, I hope someday you can find some way to understand.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.240
I'm only doing this for you.

02:12.240 --> 02:17.320
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to do.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.520
Laura, hear your keys.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.560
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.120
I'm sorry, Tim.

02:24.120 --> 02:28.520
I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.120
I'll always love you.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.120
Goodbye.

02:39.800 --> 02:56.800
Okay, so a pretty sad ending to this relationship isn't it?

02:56.800 --> 03:02.240
Yeah, but I don't think the girl was very moved or very sad by breaking up with him.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.240
I wonder why.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.920
I maybe she's got some other boyfriend somewhere else.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.920
Maybe.

03:07.160 --> 03:11.480
Well, as you mentioned, we listened to some great phrases, and it's time for us to take

03:11.480 --> 03:14.960
a look at them now in Fluency Builder.

03:14.960 --> 03:15.960
Fluency Builder.

03:15.960 --> 03:22.000
Okay, here we're going to focus on phrases that people use when they break up.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.840
So maybe you've heard these in movies, and we're going to look at the meaning now.

03:25.840 --> 03:33.040
All right, our first phrase as we heard, she started by saying, we need to talk.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.680
We need to talk.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.520
All right, so it's very direct sentence.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.720
We need to talk.

03:38.720 --> 03:42.120
So when you tell someone, we need to talk.

03:42.120 --> 03:46.080
You're telling them that you want to talk about a serious thing, right?

03:46.080 --> 03:51.280
Right, so if somebody tells you we need to talk, you know that you're going to talk

03:51.280 --> 03:53.480
about a very serious matter.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.320
Yeah, problem or a breakup or something.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.560
And after that, she told him that they should start seeing other people.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.920
Start seeing other people.

04:03.960 --> 04:09.120
Okay, I think we need to start seeing other people to see other people.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.440
All right, so this is very easy to understand.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.280
Yep, it means to to date other people.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.280
Okay, so it basically means that you will break up.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.880
Yep, it's a indirect way of saying that, right?

04:19.880 --> 04:23.840
Yeah, you're not, you're not saying, hey, let's stop dating.

04:23.840 --> 04:29.000
You're saying, oh, well, maybe we should date other people and kind of giving the idea

04:29.000 --> 04:32.880
that you will still date each other, but everyone knows you won't.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.840
All right, so let's start seeing other people.

04:36.840 --> 04:42.720
Now for our third phrase, she says, it's not you, it's me.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.360
It's not you, it's me.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.720
It's not you, it's me.

04:45.720 --> 04:51.440
Now, this is a very cliche phrase and you hear it all the time in movies and, well,

04:51.440 --> 04:52.960
some people still use it, right?

04:52.960 --> 04:56.480
Yeah, everyone says this, I've heard this, I've said this.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.560
Okay, it means basically, I'm the problem.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.840
You're not the problem, I'm the problem.

05:01.840 --> 05:06.400
All right, so I am breaking up with you because it's my fault, not your fault.

05:06.400 --> 05:12.240
Yeah, so it's kind of a nice way to break up with someone, but actually,

05:12.240 --> 05:15.640
everyone knows that it's kind of like, not true, right?

05:15.640 --> 05:17.640
It is you, you are the problem.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.400
All right, so it's not you, it's me.

05:20.400 --> 05:25.000
And then, well, in order to emphasize this, that it's not his fault,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.760
she said that I know I'm hard to deal with.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.080
So hard to deal with.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.960
Okay, if somebody is hard to deal with,

05:33.960 --> 05:39.840
there may be difficult to talk to, difficult to please, maybe difficult to manage.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.880
Okay, so it's very difficult to talk to that person.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.840
All right, hard to deal with.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.320
It's only for people, you can't do it for a situation or something else.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.560
No, you can use it for people or situations or even sometimes things.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.000
So, for example, I can say,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.760
I find this problem at work so hard to deal with.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.520
Okay, hard to deal with.

06:00.840 --> 06:05.080
So, we've seen these four phrases that we can use to break up with someone.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.320
And well, let's listen to our dialogue.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.720
Again, we're going to slow it down a little bit.

06:09.720 --> 06:14.760
And then we'll come back and look at some other phrases to stay together with someone.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.640
Honey, do you have a second?

06:19.640 --> 06:21.320
Sure. Are you okay?

06:21.320 --> 06:24.440
You seem a bit worried. What's on your mind?

06:24.440 --> 06:26.040
We need to talk.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.880
Okay.

06:27.960 --> 06:32.440
I've been thinking, and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

06:32.440 --> 06:37.080
What? Why? I mean, we've had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement,

06:37.080 --> 06:39.400
but we're happy together, aren't we?

06:39.400 --> 06:40.920
That's just it.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.920
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.560
It's not you. It's me.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.840
I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you're a great guy.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.280
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

06:52.280 --> 06:56.760
So, what are you saying? You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect.

06:56.840 --> 07:00.120
Tim, you are too good for me.

07:00.120 --> 07:04.120
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.800
The way that you made me happy.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.080
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'd be a lie.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.680
I know I'd only hurt you.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.840
I know I'd only make you cry.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.640
Maybe, come on, don't do this to me.

07:15.640 --> 07:18.840
Whatever it is, we can work it out. Just give me another chance.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.840
I know that we can get through this, but we can stick together. Don't leave me.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.080
I can't, Tim.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.600
I hope someday you can find some way to understand.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.880
I'm only doing this for you.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.880
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart,

07:33.880 --> 07:36.040
I know this is the kindest thing to do.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.440
Laura, here you're keys.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.400
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.920
I'm sorry, Tim.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.280
I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.400
I'll always love you. Goodbye.

07:53.720 --> 07:59.240
Okay, so as you said, we're now going to focus on the phrases you use to stay

07:59.240 --> 08:00.920
in a relationship with someone.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.800
So let's look at those now in the Fluency Builder part two.

08:04.920 --> 08:05.960
Fluency Builder.

08:06.760 --> 08:12.920
So the girl was trying to break up with him, and he kept on trying to convince her to stay.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.880
That's right. And one of the things he said was,

08:15.880 --> 08:18.040
we've had our ups and downs.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.880
We've had our ups and downs.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.480
Up and downs.

08:21.480 --> 08:25.320
Well, ups and downs are good times and bad times.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.680
Right, so the good times would be the ups and the bad times.

08:28.680 --> 08:29.960
Obviously the downs.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.840
All right, so it's an informal way of saying good times bad times.

08:32.840 --> 08:33.960
Mm-hmm.

08:33.960 --> 08:38.360
So they've had their ups and downs, and he said we can work it out.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.480
So we can work it out.

08:39.480 --> 08:43.160
So whatever the problem is, we can work it out.

08:43.160 --> 08:46.680
So why don't we hear some examples of how this phrase is used,

08:46.680 --> 08:49.080
and that will help us understand it a bit better.

08:49.880 --> 08:54.760
Example one, Peter and Claudia were having some problems,

08:54.760 --> 08:57.080
but they finally worked out their personal differences.

08:58.920 --> 08:59.720
Example two.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.520
We need to work out a new marketing plan for this upcoming quarter.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.160
Example three.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.160
After an hour, I finally worked out the answer to this math problem.

09:14.920 --> 09:18.360
Okay, so to work something out means to find a solution.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.400
Yeah, to solve the problem, to solve the problem.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.760
And again, he kept on insisting and saying, well,

09:24.760 --> 09:27.080
we can get through this.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.080
We can get through this.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.920
Okay, get through this.

09:30.920 --> 09:36.200
So to get through something, what does it mean to get through something?

09:36.200 --> 09:40.280
Well, basically to survive a difficult situation.

09:40.280 --> 09:40.920
All right.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.920
You're lived through a difficult time.

09:42.920 --> 09:46.920
Okay, so for them, the difficult time was this in their relationship.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.160
Yeah, or maybe you're having a problem at work,

09:49.160 --> 09:50.840
and you might say, hey, guys, don't worry.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.440
We can get through this.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.280
Just give us one more week.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.880
Okay, very good.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.320
And well, as he was saying that they can get through this,

09:59.320 --> 10:02.680
he mentioned that they have to stick together.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.440
To stick together.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.960
We got to stick together.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.320
Stick together.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.240
So again, to stick.

10:09.240 --> 10:13.400
So when something sticks together, it stays together like glue.

10:13.480 --> 10:13.960
Right.

10:13.960 --> 10:18.760
So they have to be a team and not separate in order to solve their problem.

10:18.760 --> 10:22.840
Exactly, it gives you that idea that they're going to work together

10:22.840 --> 10:24.120
and stay together.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.640
Okay, very good.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.040
So let's stick together.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.640
All right, so again, we have four great phrases to convince somebody

10:31.640 --> 10:35.160
or to say that you want to stay together in a relationship, right?

10:35.160 --> 10:35.960
That's right.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.920
So I think it'll help us to understand these if we hear them

10:38.920 --> 10:40.760
one more time in the dialogue.

10:41.720 --> 10:47.320
We're going to be the one.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.280
Honey, do you have a second?

10:58.280 --> 10:58.680
Sure.

11:01.000 --> 11:01.960
Are you okay?

11:01.960 --> 11:03.080
You seem a bit worried.

11:03.080 --> 11:03.800
What's on your mind?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.600
We need to talk.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.320
Okay.

11:08.280 --> 11:13.000
I've been thinking, and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

11:13.000 --> 11:13.800
What?

11:13.800 --> 11:14.280
Why?

11:14.280 --> 11:17.800
I mean, we've had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement,

11:17.800 --> 11:19.560
but we're happy together, aren't we?

11:19.560 --> 11:20.280
That's just it.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.360
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

11:22.920 --> 11:23.800
It's not you.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.280
It's me.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.920
I know that I can be hard to deal with.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.360
And you're a great guy.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.480
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.360
So what are you saying?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.280
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.640
Tim, you are too good for me.

11:40.200 --> 11:44.200
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.800
The way that you made me happy.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.160
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'll be a lie.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.760
I know I'd only hurt you.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.360
I know I'd only make you cry.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.160
Maybe, come on, don't do this to me.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.840
Whatever it is, we can work it out, just give me another chance.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.560
I know that we can get through this, but we stick together.

12:01.560 --> 12:02.840
Don't leave me.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.440
I can't, Tim.

12:05.080 --> 12:08.680
I hope, so I hope someday you can find some way to understand.

12:08.680 --> 12:09.960
I'm only doing this for you.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.880
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart,

12:13.880 --> 12:16.040
I know this is the kindest thing to do.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.360
Laura, here you're keys.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.400
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.360
I'm sorry, Tim.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.360
I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.200
I'll always love you.

12:28.840 --> 12:29.480
Goodbye.

12:34.440 --> 12:57.880
All right, so breaking up can be a difficult situation, especially if you're the one breaking up, right?

12:58.600 --> 13:03.080
Well, I guess it's never happy if you're the person who's being broken up with,

13:03.160 --> 13:05.960
or you're the person doing the breaking up, but you know what?

13:05.960 --> 13:10.920
I really noticed that a lot of the phrases the girl used to break up were

13:10.920 --> 13:13.480
very cliche, like you said.

13:13.480 --> 13:17.800
They were very, um, two common and kind of a joke almost.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.280
So the phrase, it's not you, it's me, it's one of them.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.160
Yep, and she also said, you deserve better.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.680
You deserve someone better.

13:24.680 --> 13:25.320
Yeah.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.120
That's a very common one saying, like, I'm not good enough for you.

13:28.120 --> 13:31.720
Yeah, but again, it kind of just loses its meaning, doesn't it?

13:31.960 --> 13:35.720
And also another phrase that's very cliche, but it wasn't in her dialogue was,

13:35.720 --> 13:37.720
maybe the timing is just not right.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.480
Yeah, people say that all the time.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.480
Yeah, so they say, no, the timing is not right.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.120
It's not the appropriate time to get beat together.

13:44.120 --> 13:49.080
Yeah, that's just an excuse for not wanting to date that special person.

13:49.080 --> 13:49.800
Exactly.

13:49.800 --> 13:54.200
So it can be a difficult situation, and people do it every day through letters.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.720
Yep, sometimes through the phone.

13:55.720 --> 13:56.120
Yep.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.880
In this case, they were breaking up in person.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.640
So listeners, why don't you tell us if you have any stories of breaking

14:01.640 --> 14:04.360
up with someone or maybe somebody broke up with you?

14:04.360 --> 14:05.000
That's right.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.240
