00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
And I'm Erica.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.500
And we're bringing you the final lesson of our job interview series.

00:10.500 --> 00:16.000
That's right, and in this lesson, we're going to be focusing on two very, very common,

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
but sometimes difficult questions.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Okay, so we've talked about preparing for the job interview in part one.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
Part two, we talked about educational background and work experience.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
And in part three, what are we going to be looking at?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
We're going to be looking at two questions. Why we should hire you?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And you're greatest weakness.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Okay, so these are the classic common questions that you'll get at a job interview, right?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
That's right, so why don't we just get started?

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
And we'll take a listen to the dialogue and see how our interview E handles these questions.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Very good.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, I have a couple of final questions.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I hope they're not too hard.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Well, why should we hire you?

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen with outstanding soft skills.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
You know, I excel at building strong long-term consumer relationships.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
For example, when I headed the customer support department, my previous company,

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
our team resolved about 70% of our customer's problems.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
So, after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
we were able to solve 90% of our customer's issues.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Impressive.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
punctuality has never been a strength in mind.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time management.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
So, I think I'm getting better now.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Great.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, let me tell you that I'm very pleased with this interview.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
We are short-listing our candidates this week.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
And next week, we will inform our short-listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Great. Thanks a lot. I hope to hear from you. Goodbye.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
Well, our interview is doing very well, but I think he had a little bit too many beans or chillies.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh my god. This is probably the most embarrassing thing I can think of.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
But he doesn't say anything, so I don't know.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Maybe he should have said, oh, pardon me excuse me.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I don't know.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I don't know. It's a controversy.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Okay, but what isn't a controversy is the language, because there's some great stuff in here.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Alright. Let's take a look at the language in language takeaway.

03:17.000 --> 03:31.000
Alright, we've got some great phrases and words for you to use when you're talking about what sort of benefits and skills and experience and expertise you can bring to a company.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
Okay. The first thing that he said and it's a very interesting word he said, technical acumen.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Technical acumen. Accumen.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
This is a really hard word. What is acumen?

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
It's basically insight and understanding and the ability to make good and difficult decisions.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Okay, so he has a very strong technical acumen.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
So a strong insight or understanding of technical issues.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Okay, or I can change it and may say, I have a very strong business acumen.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Exactly. These are the two most common ways that this word is used.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Technical acumen business acumen.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
Okay, great. Now let's take a look at another word, which is very interesting, because everybody knows it.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Yes. Excel. Excel. Excel. Excel.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Now Excel is, of course, the software that you use, right?

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah, but here it's a verb meaning to be really, really good at something.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Right. To be the best maybe.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah. To excel at something.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Yes.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
So I excel at cooking.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
All right. So Excel. You are the best.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
I mean, that's not really going to help me in a job interview, but the next word might.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Head. Head.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, in the dialogue we heard it as headed in the past, right?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah. That's right. He headed the customer's support department.

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
So I think this is very, a great, I think this is a great word to use when you were saying I was the leader.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I was the main person in charge.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
The manager. So this is a nice verb to use to show that you were leading something.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Okay. Okay. Now for the next word.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Struggle.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
To struggle.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Struggle.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Struggle.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
So what does struggle mean?

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
It means that you have difficulty doing something.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
So it's hard for you.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah. For example, when I was in school, I struggled with math.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Okay. And now I struggle with Chinese.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Exactly. So to have a hard time.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah. Why don't we hear a couple of examples of how this word is used.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Example one.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
We're really struggling to reach our sales target.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Example two.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah. To be honest, I do struggle with time management.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
Example three.

06:12.000 --> 06:20.000
The teacher farted in class and I really had to struggle not to last.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Okay. So great examples. Let's move on to our next word.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
punctuality.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
punctuality.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Okay. So to be punctual.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
It means to be on time. Always.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Always. So punctuality would be the noun form.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
Right. So the condition or the state of always being on time.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Right. So punctuality to be punctual.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah. And our interview East struggles with punctuality.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Right. Like me.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I guess you guys have something in common.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
We do.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Now he has a problem with punctuality.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
But he said he has a dress this weakness.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Yes. To address a dress.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Address.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Now if you notice it's spelled the same way as address.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
That's right.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
But you pronounce it differently.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
So the verb address has the stress on the second syllable.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Okay. Address.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yes.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
And that means to deal with to deal with the problem.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah. To acknowledge the problem.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And to try and solve it and to try and solve it.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Okay. So different from your home address where you live.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah. And they're the stresses on the first syllable.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Address.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Right. Perfect.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Very good.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Okay. So let's listen to this dialogue one more time.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
And then we'll come back and talk about these two questions.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Greatest weakness.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And why should we hire you?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Very good.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I have a couple of final questions.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I hope they're not too hard.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Well, why should we hire you?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
without standing soft skills.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
I excel at building strong long-term consumer relationships.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I resolved about 70% of our customer's problems.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
So after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
we were able to solve 90% of our customer's issues.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Woo.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Impressive.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
So what would you consider to be your greatest weakness to be honest?

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
I struggle with organization and time management.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
punctuality has never been a strength in mind.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time management.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
So I think I'm getting better now.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
Great.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Well, let me tell you that I'm very pleased with this interview.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
We are short-listing our candidates this week.

09:24.000 --> 09:32.000
And next week, we will inform our short-listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Great. Thanks a lot.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I hope to hear from you. Goodbye.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
All right, Marco. Well, this classic question, why should we hire you?

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I think you'll hear it in many, many different interviews.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And how did he deal with it here?

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Well, the first thing that he said is very, very important because they are asking you why.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
So your immediate reaction would be to answer with because or I think that.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
But there's a different way of approaching it, which is a little bit more professional.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
He said, I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
That's how he started his answer and then he explained why.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
So this sounds really strong, doesn't it?

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
Yeah, basically it just makes you seem to be very confident and puts you like you are already part of the company.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
So this is a great way to start off this question, but you got to follow this up with some information.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
So what kind of information should you be giving?

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Well, like we talked about in your work experience, the same thing goes here.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
What do you have to offer to this company?

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
What special skills or insights or experience can you bring that would help us?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah, that nobody else can bring.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Exactly.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
So again, you have to start talking about your strengths and your previous experience.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
But with examples, right?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Very, very specific examples.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
And whenever you can throw in some numbers or some specific successes that you have had.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Exactly.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
And once you've talked about these things, you can close off this answer by saying,

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
So that is just like a magical sentence saying like,

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
If you give me the chance, I will demonstrate how good I am and how I can help this company.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Yes, and I really, really strong closing arguments.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Yes.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
So that's the way you should more or less approach that question, right?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
All right.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
But let's turn now to the classic classic question, your greatest weakness.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
What is your greatest weakness?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
When you get this question, be sure to not say,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
My greatest weakness is I work too much.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
My greatest weakness is I'm a workaholic.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Or was it, or I am perfectionist?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah, these we can see right through these.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
I mean, they're too obvious and they're too silly.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I mean, everyone has a weakness.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
So don't try and turn it around into a strength.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I just don't think that's a good idea.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Okay.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
So yeah, be sure to stay away from these answers.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
But you can say anything.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Like in this case, he has a problem with being on time.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Yeah.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
So be honest, say what one of your greatest weaknesses are.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
But the key to making this weakness look good is saying what you are doing to solve this weakness.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Exactly.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
So really be truthful.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Tell the interviewer what you're not good at.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Because there's obviously something that you're not good at.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Exactly.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
So you can say I am usually late, but I am getting more organized.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm doing the seminar.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
You know, yeah, let the interviewer know that you are trying to improve this weakness.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Exactly.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
And be sure to also think about your strength, right?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Yeah.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Be prepared to answer the question.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
What is your greatest strength?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
So, and again, when you're talking about your strengths,

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
be sure it's something more specific than saying, oh, I'm very responsible.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
You want to be as specific as you can.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And again, give those examples.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Give those successes.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Give those numbers.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Right.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Exactly.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
So think about your weaknesses.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Think about your strengths.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
If you don't know them as people to ask your colleagues or ask your friends,

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
what do you think is my greatest strength?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Maybe you're a funny person.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
That's a strength.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yes.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Okay.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Well, remember there's three parts to this interviewing series.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
And you can find them on our website at EnglishPod.com.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Right.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
You can look at all of these three lessons.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
And I hope they are really helpful.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
And of course, if you have any questions or comments,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
or maybe you'd like a little bit more of this interview series,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
let us know.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
All right, guys.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Well, thanks for listening.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Good luck in your interviews.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And until next time, goodbye.
