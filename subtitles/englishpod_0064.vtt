00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello English learners. Welcome back to English pod. My name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
And I'm Erica. And today we're bringing you again the great series. I'm sorry. I love you part six.

00:13.000 --> 00:22.000
The newest installment in the English pod soap opera. Drama romance. Love tragedy.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
All of it here at English pod and in our series. So today we have a really great dialogue.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
I just can't believe what's happening here. But before we get into it, we need to preview one word.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
That's right. So let's take a look at it in vocabulary preview.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
The vocabulary preview. Well, we're going to preview this word. Sleeping with. Sleeping with someone.

00:49.000 --> 00:58.000
Sleeping with him. Yes. So it seems pretty easy. I mean, sleeping with. It just sounds like you are in bed with somebody.

00:58.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah, but you are doing a little bit more and sleeping. All right. So so in English, this phrase actually means that you are involved with someone and have an intimate sexual relationship.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Yes. You are in a relationship with someone and you are having sex.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Exactly. So be careful how you use it because I know that sometimes you want to translate and just say, well, they are in the same bed together,

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
but it's not that they're having sex. Right. So most of the time in English, the phrase sleeping with means sex.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
Right. Okay. Sleeping with. Be careful. Okay. Well, let's find out. Why are we talking about sleeping with?

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
Well, obviously somebody is sleeping with somebody. So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
This is ridiculous. I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else. How could you do this? You know what? I'm out of here.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Wait.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Doctor, how is this possible? I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
I have something to confess. I'm sorry Veronica. I lied.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Wait. What? What do you mean?

02:23.000 --> 02:35.000
I lied. You aren't even pregnant. There's no body in the oven. I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself. Veronica, I love you.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
What are you talking about? Who are you?

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
It's me, Daniel. Don't you remember me from high school? I sat behind you in science class.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
I used to go to every football game and watch you in a cheerleading squad.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
You're insane. We never even spoke. Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

03:00.000 --> 03:14.000
Because Veronica, it's not fair. I love you. I have since the first day we met. Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
I went to med school and became a doctor for you. You always said, are you wanted to marry a doctor?

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
You will be mine now. One way or another.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
I heard everything you lying bastard. Get your hands off of her.

03:35.000 --> 03:48.000
Scandal again.

03:48.000 --> 03:56.000
This poor Veronica and Steven, I don't know how the relationship could get more complicated.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
It's amazing. They're having an amazing adventure in their love life.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
I love life. Nothing like this.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
We saw some really great words. Let's take a look at them in language takeaway.

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
Language takeaway. The words we're looking at now are about feelings.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Let's take a look at the first one. Confess.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Confess. What does that mean?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
When you confess something, you tell a secret that you've been hiding.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
That's pretty easy. Have a secret and you want to tell someone you are confessing.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
It's usually something negative.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
I confess that I stole five dollars from you.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Oh, you did. Sorry.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
No wonder my wallet is lighter.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Confess. I shall not forgive you for this.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Let's take a look at our next word.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Overwhelmed.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I am overwhelmed.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
When I am overwhelmed, I am filled with emotion.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
It can be good emotions and bad emotions, right?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah, but you just feel too much.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
It's like you're going to explode.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Okay. I am overwhelmed with joy.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Yes.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Or I'm overwhelmed with work.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
And I am overwhelmed with jealousy.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Like this guy.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Right?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And that's our third word.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
jealousy.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
jealousy.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
So this is interesting because jealousy is the noun.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
That's right. It's the feeling of being jealous.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Which is the adjective, which is the adjective.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
So what does it mean when you are jealous?

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
It means that you see somebody and you want what they have.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Okay. You want what they have.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
So in this case, the doctor is jealous of Veronica's boyfriend because the doctor wants Veronica.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Okay. jealous.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
So Erica, are you a jealous wife?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
I don't know maybe a little bit.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
A little bit.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
But I've never gone to the extent of telling someone that they're pregnant.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
All right. jealousy.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Okay.

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
And let's take a look at our next two words, which are actually kind of insults, right?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah, they're not very kind words at all.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Okay.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
But you got to learn them anyways.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Okay. Let's take a look at this one.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Jerk.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Jerk.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
He's a jerk.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
J-E-R-K.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Jerk.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Jerk.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
So what does it mean if someone is a jerk?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
A stupid and mean person?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Plain as simple as that.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Stupid and mean.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
So can a woman be a jerk?

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
It's mostly male, but now it's becoming more common to use with women as well.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Okay. So I can say he is a jerk or she is a jerk.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah, but it is more common for men.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Okay.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And now let's take a look at our last word.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You line bastard.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Bastard.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Bastard.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Bastard.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Wow. This is pretty strong as well.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah. You got to be careful about this one.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
This one is almost a swear word.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Almost.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Yeah.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
So what does it mean if you call someone a bastard?

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
Well, literally it means your mother and father were not married when you were born.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Exactly.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
So it is a pretty big insult.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yes.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
A little bit, I guess.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
But it doesn't really really mean that your mother and father weren't married.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Right.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
But it means that you are a jerk.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
You're a jerk.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
You're a really big jerk.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
You're a mean person, a really mean person.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
So jerk isn't as strong as a bastard, right?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yes.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Bastard is stronger.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Okay. So you got to be careful when you throw that word in there or how you would use it.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And again, it's for men, right?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Not for women.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah. You can't use this word with women.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay. There's another one out there.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
But that will have to wait for another English pod.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Well, apparently all of these words are just for men.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
What did we do wrong?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I, Marco, I can't be getting to tell you.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Okay.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Okay. So let's listen to our dialogue again.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
And then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

08:20.000 --> 08:30.000
This is ridiculous.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
How could you do this?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
You know what?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm out of here.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Wait.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Dr.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
How is this possible?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I have something to confess.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I'm sorry Veronica.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I lied.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Wait.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
What?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
What do you mean?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I lied.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You aren't even pregnant.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
There's no body in the oven.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
that I couldn't help myself.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Veronica, I love you.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
What are you talking about?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Who? Who are you?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
It's me, Daniel.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Don't you remember me from high school?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I sat behind you in science class.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I used to go to every football game

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You're insane.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
We never even spoke.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Because Veronica, it's not fair.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I love you.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I have since the first day we met.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Everything was going fine.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Until that jerk came into the picture

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
and ruined everything.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
You always said, are you wanted to marry a doctor?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
You will be mine now.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
One way or another.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I heard everything you lying bastard.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Get your hands off of her.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Alright, so great stuff.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Jerk, bastards, all that good words going around.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
But we've also got some amazing phrases.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
So why don't we take a look at those now

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
and fluency builder?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Fluency builder.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Alright, so in fluency builder today,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
we have three great phrases.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Let's take a look at the first one.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Bun in the oven.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
A bun in the oven.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
A bun in the oven.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Okay, this is obviously an idiomatic phrase.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
It could be literal as well, right?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Like you could actually have a piece of bread in your oven.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Right.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Bun is a piece of bread in the oven.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
But in this context, we're not using it.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
No, it means your pregnant.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Your pregnant.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
So the baby is the bun.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah, and the oven is your stomach.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Right, so you say she has a bun in the oven.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yes, she's pregnant.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
She's pregnant.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Okay.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
It could be difficult to understand if you don't really have the explanation.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yes.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
You were to say what?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
She has bread in the oven.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
A bun in the oven.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Okay.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Now let's take a look at the second one.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Couldn't help myself.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I couldn't help myself.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I couldn't help myself.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
So when you can't help yourself, you can't control yourself.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Right.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
You did something, but you couldn't control it.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
You couldn't stop it.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
You couldn't stop it.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Okay.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
So let's listen to some examples of how you would use.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
I couldn't help myself because it's a phrase that you can use in many different ways.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Right?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
That's right.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Let's listen.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
One.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I just couldn't help myself.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
When I saw your car, I just had to buy it.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Example two.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm sorry.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I couldn't help myself.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I just started laughing.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Example three.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
The cake was so good.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I couldn't help myself.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
I ate it all.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
All right.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Perfect.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Couldn't help myself.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Easy.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Now the doctor, he couldn't help himself from lying to Veronica.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
Because he was angry that her boyfriend Steven came into the picture.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Came into the picture.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
To come into the picture.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Okay.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
So what does it mean when somebody comes into the picture?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Well, basically, you appear in somebody's life.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
You come into somebody's life.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
So imagine that your life is a picture.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And somebody, all of a sudden, comes into it.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
So they come into the picture.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
They come into your life.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Come into your life.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Yes.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
So he's angry that Steven appeared into Veronica's life.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And they're in love.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
And all that stuff.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yeah.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
All right.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Well, these are some great phrases.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And why don't we listen to them again in context?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
So let's listen to the dialogue.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
This is ridiculous.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
How could you do this?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
You know what?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
I'm out of here.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Wait.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Doctor.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
How is this possible?

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I have something to confess.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I'm sorry, Veronica.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I lied.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Wait.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
What?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
What do you mean?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I lied.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
You aren't even pregnant.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
There's no body in the oven.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
that I couldn't help myself.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Veronica, I love you.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
What are you talking about?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Who are you?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
It's me, Daniel.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Don't you remember me from high school?

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
I sat behind you in science class.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I used to go to every football game

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
You're insane.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
We never even spoke.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Because Veronica, it's not fair.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
I love you.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I have since the first day we met.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Everything was going fine until that jerk

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
came into the picture and ruined everything.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
You always said, are you wanted to marry a doctor?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
You will be mine now.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
One way or another.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
I heard everything you lying bastard.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Get your hands off of her.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Open the door.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Okay.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Veronica's not pregnant.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
That was a close one.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Actually, they're not married.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
This is a very controversial topic.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Being knocked up.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Nice phrase.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
There's a lot of interesting phrases

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
and ways you can talk about pregnancy.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
If you're knocked up, you're pregnant.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
You can hear that in movies.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I would say a proper way of saying that.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
No, it's not that polite.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
It gives you the idea that it was a mistake.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
You would say she got knocked up.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yes.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Another common phrase is,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Pregors.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Pregors.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I heard this is a more Australian.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
She's pregnant.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It's actually a pretty interesting topic.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
I know that, for example, in Latin America,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
if a girl that's maybe in her early 20s

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
gets pregnant accidentally by her boyfriend,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
usually the families expect them to get married.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Really?

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
It's kind of like, should they get married?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
There's a lot of pressure.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
A lot of pressure.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
But it's different in other countries, right?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I don't know.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
For you guys, what's it like in your country,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
where you live?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Is there pressure on the guy in the girl to get married?

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
I mean, should Steven and Veronica get married in this situation?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Or what about just living together,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
or as they say, living in sin, right?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Living in sin.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Living together, living in sin.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Is it okay to just live together with your girlfriend,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
or should you get married before?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Mm-hmm.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
This is a controversial topic,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
so we'll have a lot of different opinions.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
But it should be interesting.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Yes.
