00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello English learners, welcome back to English Pod, my name is Marko.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And I'm Erica.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
And today we're going to be looking at another kind of science fiction lesson related to aliens.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
That's right, and I think in this lesson we'll actually have an alien sighting here at English Pod.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Right, an alien encounter.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
So we're going to be learning about the stars.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
We're going to be learning about aliens and UFOs today.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
That's right, and we're also going to learn some language that you can use to describe negative results.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Things that happen that are bad.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
That's right, so let's start by looking at vocabulary preview.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Very vocabulary preview.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Okay, we have two words for you that we're going to hear in the dialogue.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
And the first one is constellation.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
constellation.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
A constellation.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
All right, so we've all looked up in the sky and seen shapes or figures.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
That are formed by the stars.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
That's right, so a constellation is a group of stars that makes a shape and has a name.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Right, there are a total of 88 known constellation.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
So the most popular ones, I think, maybe are the little dipper, the big dipper, et cetera.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
I never knew where such a fan of astronomy, Marko.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
A little bit.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
All right, what about the next one?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
The next one is earthlings.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Earthlings.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
So earthlings are people who live on planet earth on earth.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Exactly.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
And in the dialogue, we're going to hear greetings earthlings.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
This is the most typical phrase that you will hear in almost every single alien movie.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Exactly, so it's like saying hello people from earth.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Yes, every single alien in the world says this phrase.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
So those are the two words that we are going to find in this dialogue today.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
So why don't we start and listen to what happens with our UFO experience?

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh honey, this is so romantic.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
I've never seen like so many stars before.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
It's beautiful.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
See that constellation there?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
That's Orion.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
And the very bright star?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
That's actually Venus.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
What's that big flash you want?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I don't know.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I think it's a UFO.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
She thinks earthlings are coming from afar from a distinct galaxy known only to a few.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Why are you here?

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Where did you come from?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
We have been observing you for the last 3,000 years.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such words as the touch of the hall,

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
or massive pieces such as the half-nir symphony.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity does not come with a consequence.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
And we are great to say your planet from you.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
You think you have us figured out?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Who it gives you the right to come and judge us?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Who are you to play God with our fate?

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Silent Earth is an adventure that has caused the years of pain and anguish among yourselves.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Now you're paraphrase.

03:42.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, that didn't work out so well for the Earthlings.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Now did it.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
I think the aliens are a little bit belligerent themselves.

03:57.000 --> 04:06.000
Alright, so why don't we start by looking at some of those difficult words that we might have found in this dialogue in language takeaway?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Language takeaway.

04:10.000 --> 04:18.000
Okay, well the aliens are using a lot of language to describe some of the negative results that are happening because of the humans behavior on Earth, right?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Right.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
And so one of the things they said was that your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Consequence.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Without consequence.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Alright, so the consequence of an action are basically the results.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yes, exactly.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
And here the phrase without consequence suggests the negative results.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Alright, so the negative results from your actions.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Hmm.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Very good.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
What about our next word?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, the aliens also talked about human ambition.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Ambition.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Ambition.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
So what is ambition exactly?

04:55.000 --> 05:03.000
So ambition is the desire or the want for things to be better to improve, to get rich, to be technologically advanced.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Okay, so to want more.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yep.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
You have ambitions in your life and your professional life and your personal life.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
So basically we have ambition and we have desires and these are the reasons for our downfall.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay, so downfall.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Downfall.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
We'll be your downfall.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
So the downfall of something is something that causes failure.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Okay, so the loss of wealth or the loss of reputation,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
know that it's, it gets ruined.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Exactly.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
The downfall.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
We can say like for example, the downfall of the Roman Empire.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Or you know what?

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
This guy is a great employee, but his lack of ambition was his downfall.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Very good.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Alright, coming up to our next word, the alien described that humans have a belligerent attitude.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
belligerent.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
belligerent.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
belligerent.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Alright, this is a very nice word.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use it in context?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Example one.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Don't take that belligerent tone with me.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
I don't want to argue with you.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Example two.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Thomas is always so belligerent.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
It isn't possible to talk to him.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Example three.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Stacey was fired for her belligerent attitude.

06:29.000 --> 06:37.000
Okay, so I can understand that it means sort of aggressive having a strong willingness to fight.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Exactly.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
A belligerent person, a belligerent attitude, a belligerent country.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Okay.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Very good.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And our last word for today.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Anguish.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Anguish.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
So to cause great anguish.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
To cause a lot of terrible emotional or physical pain.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Okay, so it is a syndrome of pain of suffering.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah, but really intense suffering.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Really intense.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Why don't we give a few examples.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
The end of his marriage caused him great anguish.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
Or for example, the loss of his dog caused him great anguish.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Okay, so anguish.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Alright, so we've covered five great words on language takeaway today.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
Why don't we move on now to putting it together?

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Put your hands together.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
Okay, we're going to look at three phrases that we heard in the dialogue and see how we can use them in different contexts.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
So the aliens were praising some of the master pieces that the humans have created, right?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Right.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
He said, you humans create such wonders as the Taj Mahal blah blah blah.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Okay.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So let's look at this phrase.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Such wonders as.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Alright, so we have a noun here, a wonder.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
An amazing thing.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
An amazing structure.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yes.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
So he says such wonders as.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Now we can change this noun and replace it with another one, right?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah, we can replace that noun with anything.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
So why don't we hear a few examples?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Example one.

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
To finish this house, we need such materials as cement, wood, and steel.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Example two.

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
I need to write a report on a social topic such as psychology, health, or marriage.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Example three.

08:36.000 --> 08:44.000
Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great marketing opportunities.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
So this is a really useful structure to use when you want to give examples of many different things.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Okay.

08:51.000 --> 09:00.000
And as the alien was criticizing the humans, the guy said, what gives you the right to come and judge us?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
So interesting phrase, what gives you the right?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
What gives you the right?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
All right.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
So if I tell you what gives you the right to and then a verb.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yep.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
What am I saying there?

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
You're basically saying you don't have the right to do this.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
You shouldn't do this.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Why are you doing it?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Or why do you want to have this control over me?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Yep.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
So when would you use this phrase?

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
If somebody is trying to control you or maybe somebody is judging you or doing something to you against

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
your will, maybe?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yep.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
You would say what gives you the right to take my phone away?

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
What gives you the right to tell me what to do?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
All right.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
It's a good phrase to tell that other person that they shouldn't do that.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
They're doing something unfair.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Unfair.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Okay.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
And our next phrase is very similar.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Who are you to play God with our fate?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Okay.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
So I want to look at this.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I'm to play God.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
All right.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
So to play God is making these arbitrary decisions like he is the master of everything.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Right.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Controlling everything.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
But this phrase, who are you to?

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
So basically saying you don't have the power or authority to do this.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And you can use it in exactly the same way.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Who are you to tell me what to do?

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Who are you to take away my phone?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Exactly.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
So you don't have the power to do this.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Very good.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
This is our little bit aggressive almost belligerent.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Wouldn't you say?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
A little bit.

10:30.000 --> 10:39.000
But I guess if you are being treated unfair or if you are angry at a situation, it would be a good phrase to use to put your point across.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yes.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And as we saw, these humans are pretty angry.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
So why don't we listen again as they're telling the aliens?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Who are you to?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Do this to us.

10:48.000 --> 11:00.000
Oh honey, this is so romantic.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
I have never seen like so many stars before.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
It's beautiful.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
See that constellation there?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
That's Orion.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And the very bright star.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
That's actually Venus.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
What's that big flash you want?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
I don't know.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I think it's a UFO.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
She thinks Earthlings.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I can't from afar.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
From a distinct galaxy, known only to a few.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Why are you here?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Where did you come from?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
We have been observing you for the last 3,000 years.

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the touch of the hall or massive pieces such as the half-nerce symphony.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Your ambition and desire for more will be your default.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
And we are great to see your planet from you.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
You think you have us figured out?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
What gives you the right to come and judge us?

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
Who are you to play God with our fate?

12:41.000 --> 12:49.000
Okay, so UFOs and constellations and stars and planets.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Have you ever had an encounter with one of these?

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
Well, definitely not an encounter with a UFO, but maybe with some of the wonders of the night sky.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
What happened?

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Well, you know, when I was small, I used to have my vacations up in Northern Canada.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
And because it was so far away from the city, it was really dark.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
And you could see all of these shooting stars.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
So these stars moving across the sky and lighting up the whole sky with their brightness.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
And it really is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
So shooting stars are like balls of fire that move across the sky, right?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Yeah, exactly.

13:25.000 --> 13:33.000
And I saw once actually I was in an astronomy class and turned around and over the horizon like at the end of the sky.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Where this guy meets the earth, I saw this huge ball of fire move across the sky.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
And it looked like it landed in the field next to us. It was so close.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Wow, that's nice.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah, pretty amazing.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Well, I imagine that it is really amazing.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
And I guess Canada is the place to be when you want to see these things.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
I know, we've got like Northern lights, we've got shooting stars, lots of stuff.

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000

Or even a UFO.
