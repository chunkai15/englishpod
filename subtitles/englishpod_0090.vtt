Hello English learners. Welcome back to English Pod. My name is Marco.

00:04.640 --> 00:10.640
And I'm Erica. And today we're bringing you the eighth part of our dramatic romantic love story.

00:10.640 --> 00:15.680
I'm sorry I love you. That's right. We're coming close to the end of this story, aren't we?

00:15.680 --> 00:20.240
Yeah, we're coming close to the end and we still have a lot of interesting things going on.

00:20.240 --> 00:26.160
So I wonder what's going to happen? Well, um, I can tell you that today's lesson involves

00:26.320 --> 00:32.080
this word which we'll hear in vocabulary preview. Very vocabulary preview.

00:33.280 --> 00:39.760
So today we're just going to look at this one word. Spy. A spy. A spy. Spy.

00:40.800 --> 00:47.840
All right. So we probably know famous spies like James Bond or Austin Powers. Right. So basically

00:47.840 --> 00:53.840
it's a person who is secretly trying to get information about a government or maybe a business.

00:53.840 --> 01:01.040
Right. So that's a spy. Now the verb. Two spy. Same thing, right? To spy on someone. Yes,

01:01.040 --> 01:08.000
spy on a company. Yep. So why are we talking spies and spying here on English Pod? Why don't we

01:08.080 --> 01:10.000
find out by listening to our dialogue?

01:28.240 --> 01:36.240
Veronica. Veronica? Veronica, are you okay? Steven. What's going on? Who were those guys?

01:37.200 --> 01:42.720
I didn't know you have a gun. What's going on? I will come clean as soon as we get to save you, okay?

01:42.720 --> 01:46.960
For now you have to trust me, please. I would never do anything to hurt you. Steven, I-

01:46.960 --> 01:48.960
Okay, run!

02:07.200 --> 02:14.160
I haven't been completely honest with you Veronica. I'm sorry. I'm not a fireman. I'm not even from the United States.

02:15.040 --> 02:21.920
I'm a spy for the Indian government. What? Why didn't you tell me before? What are you doing here?

02:22.880 --> 02:26.960
When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket with my father back in my hometown if I'd

02:26.960 --> 02:33.280
you're a bad. He was a peaceful town and my father was a renowned chemist. One day he was approached

02:33.280 --> 02:38.640
by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small

02:38.640 --> 02:45.520
lab back at the university, where he taught biochemistry. I never saw him again. I vowed to discover

02:45.520 --> 02:50.560
the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian intelligence bureau. What does it have

02:50.560 --> 02:56.960
to do with those men shooting at us? And most importantly, why did you lie to me? I'm sorry.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.760
I wasn't supposed to meet you. I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you, but you have to believe

03:01.840 --> 03:07.040
me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real. I can't believe this.

03:08.080 --> 03:12.400
Why are all these things happening to me? I can't take it anymore. Let me out of the car.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.600
Veronica wait.

03:23.120 --> 03:29.120
All right, so Stephen is not even American. He's an Indian spy. He's not even a fire fighter.

03:30.080 --> 03:36.240
Well, there you go. Oh my god. Many surprises on this love story. It gets deeper and deeper.

03:37.040 --> 03:42.400
Well, why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that was used in this great story in language

03:42.400 --> 03:52.240
takeaway? Language takeaway. Well, here we've got a lot of language that you can use when you

03:52.240 --> 03:56.720
need to be honest about something. We're going to look at six phrases here. Now the first one,

03:56.720 --> 04:04.960
Stephen says he needs to come clean. Come clean. Come clean. Right, so basically he needs to tell the

04:04.960 --> 04:11.600
truth. He needs to confess. Confess, right? About something that he maybe wasn't truthful about

04:11.600 --> 04:18.000
in the past. Yeah, maybe he had a secret or maybe he lied about something. Yep. So now he's coming clean.

04:19.040 --> 04:25.200
Very good. So he comes clean and he tells the story about his childhood. He says his father was

04:25.200 --> 04:34.080
a renowned chemist renowned renowned. Okay, so if you're a renowned chemist you're a very famous and

04:34.080 --> 04:41.200
well respected. So you can use that with people with places a renowned restaurant. Okay, so very popular.

04:41.200 --> 04:46.560
Very well known. Yeah, we also hear it's commonly like this a world renowned

04:46.560 --> 04:52.880
chemist a world renowned restaurant. So not only popular locally, but the whole world knows about

04:53.600 --> 04:59.200
very good. All right, and so he continues with his story and he says he was approached by members of the

04:59.200 --> 05:07.760
CIA approached to be approached by. Okay, so if I am approached by somebody from the CIA,

05:07.760 --> 05:13.760
what does that mean? Well, they they come to talk to you about something really important. Okay,

05:13.760 --> 05:19.600
so the verb to approach someone can mean get close to. Right, to walk up to them or something like that.

05:20.480 --> 05:27.200
But it also carries this this meaning of coming to talk to you about something something important

05:27.200 --> 05:31.760
something very important. Yep. So for example, I can say my boss approached me this morning to

05:31.760 --> 05:39.760
talk about an important pay raise. Ooh, like you. Or maybe Jim approached me to ask if I know if his

05:39.760 --> 05:45.200
wife is cheating on him or not. Wow. All right, so that's how you would use this verb approach

05:45.360 --> 05:51.840
someone. Now let's move on to the next word. So he was approached by members of the CIA and they were claiming

05:51.840 --> 05:58.800
something about his father. That's right. So to claim claim something. To claim something. All right, so

05:58.800 --> 06:05.280
basically when you're claiming something you are saying that it's true. Right, it might not be true.

06:05.280 --> 06:12.640
But we don't know. Yeah. So for example, he claims he makes four million dollars a year. Okay,

06:12.640 --> 06:19.440
or Bob claims that he saw UFO. Mm-hmm. We can't prove it if it's true or not. But that's what

06:19.440 --> 06:26.080
they're saying is true. Yep. So Steven's father disappeared and well he vowed to discover where

06:26.080 --> 06:34.400
he was. So Steven vowed to find his father. Vow. To vow. So this verb to vow means to make a

06:34.400 --> 06:40.240
strong promise, right? Yes. And we use it also in marriage, right? Wedding vows. Wedding vows, which are

06:40.240 --> 06:45.120
basically promises. Mm-hmm. So if you vow something you make a very strong promise. Yes,

06:45.120 --> 06:50.160
it's very, very bad if you break a vow. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. What happens? I don't know,

06:50.160 --> 06:57.440
probably funder strikes you and you die. All right, so don't break your vows. Yeah. And the last word

06:57.440 --> 07:06.560
on language takeaway today. The whereabouts. The whereabouts of his father. Mm-hmm. So the whereabouts

07:06.640 --> 07:13.200
is the location. The location. Kind of unknown location, right? Right. I think this is a great

07:13.200 --> 07:21.680
word for us to listen to some more examples. Example one. The police don't have any information on

07:21.680 --> 07:35.040
the whereabouts of the murderer. Example two. Currently the whereabouts of the president are unknown.

07:36.640 --> 07:45.600
Example three. You live in Toronto too? Whereabouts do you live?

07:48.480 --> 07:54.000
All right, so whereabouts. Perfect. You can use it for location, unknown location. Mm-hmm. All right,

07:54.000 --> 07:59.600
so some great words. Now I want to move on to some phrases that we heard in the dialogue.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.880
Um, and let's look at those now in fluency builder. Fluency builder.

08:05.840 --> 08:11.840
All right, on fluency builder today, we have four great phrases and let's start with the first one.

08:12.800 --> 08:19.600
What's going on? So Veronica asks what's going on? Steven, what's going on? Basically what's

08:19.600 --> 08:25.200
happening, right? What's happening? What's what's what's the situation? Yeah. Now another interesting

08:25.200 --> 08:30.640
thing is that among friends you could use this phrase to say, hey, how are you? How are you?

08:30.640 --> 08:35.120
How is it going, right? So you can say, hey, Erica, what's going on? And it all depends on your

08:35.120 --> 08:40.160
your tone of voice. So, um, when you want to know how that person is, hey, Marko, what's going on?

08:40.720 --> 08:46.960
Right, but if you're angry or maybe something strange is happening, you're like, hey, what's going on here?

08:46.960 --> 08:53.280
Yes, so your voice falls. Right. Now let's take a look at our next phrase and this one is

08:53.280 --> 09:00.160
very, very useful, especially if you've lied. Yes, so Steven says, I haven't been completely

09:00.240 --> 09:05.680
honest with you. I haven't been completely honest with you. I haven't been completely honest with

09:05.680 --> 09:11.680
you. So that means he hasn't been telling the whole truth. Right, pretty easy to understand, but

09:11.680 --> 09:18.480
I think it's use is interesting here. Right, you might use it to kind of soften up the person to

09:18.480 --> 09:24.160
confess something. Right. So when you're ready to come clean about a secret you have or allow you

09:24.160 --> 09:31.040
told, this is a great way to prepare your listener. Right, know what? I haven't been completely honest

09:31.040 --> 09:37.600
with you. Yeah, moving on to our third phrase. So the CIA claimed that Steven's father had made

09:37.600 --> 09:43.440
the discovery of the millennium. The discovery of the millennium. Discovery of the millennium.

09:44.160 --> 09:52.400
Okay, let's break this down. Millennium is a thousand years. Right. So the discovery of the millennium

09:52.480 --> 09:59.520
is the best most important discovery in the past thousand years. Right. So now we can change it a

09:59.520 --> 10:05.440
little bit and say the invention of the millennium or even the party of the millennium. Exactly. So

10:05.440 --> 10:09.840
it doesn't necessarily have to be the most important of the last one thousand years. But it means

10:09.840 --> 10:14.880
it was pretty good. It was pretty good. Very important. Yeah. You can also say the discovery of the

10:14.880 --> 10:20.880
decade, right? Of the decade of the century of the year. Yep. And now let's take a look at a

10:20.960 --> 10:26.000
last phrase. So Steven confessed. He came clean. He told her everything. But he said,

10:26.000 --> 10:32.880
he wasn't supposed to fall in love with her. I wasn't supposed to. I wasn't supposed to fall in love

10:32.880 --> 10:37.920
with you. All right. So let's look at this phrase. I wasn't supposed to. It's an interesting

10:37.920 --> 10:45.360
one. It's sort of like a cross between I didn't need to. And I shouldn't have done. Right.

10:45.840 --> 10:52.080
Now let's look at some examples. I wasn't supposed to come to work today. All right. So you

10:52.080 --> 10:58.640
didn't need to. It wasn't necessary. All right. So maybe it was your annual vacation day but you came

10:58.640 --> 11:04.320
into work anyway. Or maybe it was a holiday and I came to work anyways. So so the plan was not for you

11:04.320 --> 11:09.280
to come to work. Right. So in this case we're saying it wasn't necessary. Or it wasn't planned.

11:09.280 --> 11:14.640
Or planned. Yeah. Now let's look at it the other way when you shouldn't. Okay. Marco, I wasn't

11:14.640 --> 11:21.840
supposed to tell you this but. Okay. So now in this case you shouldn't be telling me this. You shouldn't

11:21.840 --> 11:29.120
tell me the secret. Yep. But you're going to anyways. Yes. Off air. So I wasn't supposed to. In this case

11:29.120 --> 11:34.560
it means I shouldn't. All right. Some really great language here. Now I think it would help us to

11:34.560 --> 12:00.640
hear it one more time in on the dialogue. Veronica Veronica Veronica Veronica are you okay? Steven

12:01.600 --> 12:08.640
What's going on? Who were those guys? I didn't know you have a gun. What's going on?

12:08.640 --> 12:13.120
I will come clean as soon as we get to safety. Okay. For now you have to trust me please. I would never

12:13.120 --> 12:16.160
do anything to hurt you. Steven. I. Okay. Run.

12:30.640 --> 12:41.680
I haven't been completely honest with you Veronica. I'm sorry. I'm not a fireman. I'm not even

12:41.680 --> 12:49.280
from the United States. I'm a spy for the Indian government. What? Why didn't you tell me before?

12:49.280 --> 12:54.640
What are you doing here? When I was a young boy I used to play cricket with my father back in my

12:54.640 --> 13:01.280
hometown of Hyderabad. He was a peaceful town and my father was a renowned chemist. One day he

13:01.280 --> 13:06.320
was approached by members of the CIA claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium

13:06.320 --> 13:12.640
in his small lab back at the university where he taught biochemistry. I never saw him again.

13:12.640 --> 13:18.160
I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian intelligence bureau.

13:18.160 --> 13:23.200
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? And most importantly why did you

13:23.280 --> 13:29.280
lie to me? I'm sorry. I wasn't supposed to meet you. I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you,

13:29.280 --> 13:35.440
but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real. I can't believe this.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.800
Why are all these things happening to me? I can't take it anymore. Let me out of the car.

13:41.760 --> 13:54.240
Veronica wait it. Okay great. So now we're getting close to the end of this series.

13:54.240 --> 13:58.800
So what's going to happen? Maybe Veronica is also a spy. Oh my god. I don't think I can handle that.

13:59.760 --> 14:05.120
All right. So we really need your suggestions. We need your ideas. We want to know how you think

14:05.120 --> 14:09.280
the series ends or how you would want it to and do you want it to be a happy ending?

14:09.280 --> 14:15.200
Or tragedy? Or maybe action-filled ending. All right. Well we got two lessons left in the series.

14:15.200 --> 14:21.200
So visit our website at EnglishPod.com and leave your suggestions. All right guys. We'll see you guys there.
