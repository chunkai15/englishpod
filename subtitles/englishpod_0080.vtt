00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to English Pod, my name is Marco.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
And I'm Erica.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.200
And today we're bringing you again our romantic dramatic suspense series.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.700
I'm sorry I love you part seven.

00:15.700 --> 00:20.000
So we're going to find out what's happening with Steven and Veronica.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Right, in the last episode, Veronica was at the doctors.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.300
She was pregnant.

00:25.300 --> 00:29.500
But then the doctor told her it was a lie and he made it up and she wasn't even pregnant.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.500
Exactly.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.500
So now let's see what Veronica and Steven are going to say to each other, maybe they will break up.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.500
I don't know.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.500
I don't think so.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.500
But let's listen.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.500
Thank God you showed up when you did.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.500
He's insane.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.500
Do you think we should call the police?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.500
I don't worry about it.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.500
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.500
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.500
What a nut job.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.500
I know.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.500
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.500
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.500
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.500
Don't apologize.

01:10.500 --> 01:15.500
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.500
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just, I'm just scared Veronica.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.500
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.500
The thought of not being with you.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.500
I just can't handle it.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.500
We were made for each other, Veronica.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.500
You're my everything.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.500
My soulmate.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.500
What can I do?

01:33.500 --> 01:34.500
Just hold me.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.500
I'll always be here for you no matter what.

01:37.500 --> 01:41.500
And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
I believe in us, Steven.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.500
I'm so happy to hear that.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.500
I know we belong together.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
I love you so much.

01:54.500 --> 02:13.500
It was such a romantic moment and now what happened?

02:13.500 --> 02:14.500
Somebody got shot.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.500
Oh my god, I don't know.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.500
This is so big.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.500
I can't believe this is happening.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.500
Well, it's a very intense drama.

02:21.500 --> 02:28.500
But we saw some great words and a lot of great phrases in there when Steven was telling her all these beautiful words, right?

02:28.500 --> 02:29.500
That's right.

02:29.500 --> 02:34.500
So why don't we look at some of these words now in language takeaway?

02:34.500 --> 02:37.500
Language takeaway.

02:37.500 --> 02:43.500
Veronica was glad or was she was very happy that Steven showed up.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.500
That's right.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.500
Showed up.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.500
So to show up.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.500
Right.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.500
To come to a place.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.500
Okay.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.500
Or to arrive.

02:50.500 --> 02:55.500
So let's listen to some examples of how we can use show up in different contexts.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.500
Example one.

02:58.500 --> 03:05.500
We were waiting for you like an hour and you never showed up.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.500
Example two.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.500
I didn't invite him to the party.

03:10.500 --> 03:15.500
He just simply showed up and invited.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.500
Example three.

03:19.500 --> 03:26.500
After months of being lost, my dog finally showed up with a family.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.500
All right.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.500
So I think it's pretty clear now.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.500
The verb show up.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.500
And I think this verb is a little bit informal, isn't it?

03:32.500 --> 03:33.500
Yes.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.500
You wouldn't really tell your boss, hey, I'm waiting for you to show up.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.500
Yeah.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.500
Yeah.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.500
It's a bit too informal.

03:38.500 --> 03:42.500
As you know, the doctor, he was stalking Veronica.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.500
That's right.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.500
So that's our next word.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.500
Stock to stock somebody.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.500
STALK.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.500
Okay.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.500
Stock.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.500
Now this isn't a good thing, right?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.500
No, this is bad.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.500
So what happens when you stock someone?

03:56.500 --> 04:00.500
You follow them secretly for a long time.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.500
And then maybe you watch them.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.500
Yeah.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.500
You're standing outside their window, watching them get on dress.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.500
There's something.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.500
Okay.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.500
So many famous people have stalkers, right?

04:11.500 --> 04:12.500
Yeah.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.500
The noun that the noun for makes sense.

04:15.500 --> 04:19.500
So if I am stalking somebody, I am considered to be a stalker.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.500
Yes.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.500
So to stock.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.500
So don't do this.

04:22.500 --> 04:26.500
So Stephen describe this stalker as a nut job.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.500
A nut job.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
A nut job.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.500
Okay.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.500
Very, very informal.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.500
And it doesn't really mean anything literally.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.500
But it's crazy.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.500
Yes.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.500
It means a crazy person.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.500
A crazy person.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.500
What a nut job.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.500
He's a nut job.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.500
Okay.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.500
Do you really call this to someone like to their face?

04:43.500 --> 04:44.500
No.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.500
No, definitely not.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.500
It's definitely impolite.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
Right.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.500
You can't say to someone, oh, you're a nut job.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.500
Yeah.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.500
But it's not a swear word.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
No, but it's a little bit insulting, right?

04:53.500 --> 04:54.500
That's saying you're crazy.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.500
Yeah.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.500
But stronger.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.500
Well, the doctor was a nut job.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.500
He was stalking her.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.500
And she apologized to Stephen for getting him worked up.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.500
Worked up.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.500
So work up.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.500
To be worked up.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
When you get worked up, what happens?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.500
You get really emotional.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.500
And usually angry or sad or upset.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.500
But a negative emotion.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.500
Okay.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.500
So you got worked up.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.500
So it's always used with the verb to get.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.500
So to get worked up.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.500
Okay.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.500
You get worked up.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.500
You got worked up.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.500
Okay.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.500
Very good.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.500
And well, Stephen got worked up over nothing.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.500
But he didn't mind.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500
He said she is his love.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.500
And he called her his soulmate.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.500
His soulmate.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.500
Soulmate.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.500
That's right.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
A very romantic word.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.500
Meaning the perfect person for you.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.500
Right.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.500
Your other half.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.500
Yes.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.500
Okay.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.500
So your soulmate is that perfect compliment for you.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.500
And it's usually romantic, right?

05:50.500 --> 05:51.500
Usually romantic.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.500
But sometimes you might use it with your very, very, very best friend.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
Okay.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.500
Because you understand each other.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
Yeah.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
You know what the other ones thinking.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.500
You're the perfect fit together.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.500
Okay.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.500
Soulmate.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.500
Very good.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.500
Well, we've seen some really interesting words.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.500
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again.

06:09.500 --> 06:13.500
And then we'll come back and look at some of the phrases that we're used.

06:13.500 --> 06:19.500
Thank God you showed up when you did.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.500
He's insane.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
Do you think we should call the police?

06:23.500 --> 06:25.500
I don't worry about it.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.500
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.500
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
What a nut job.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
I know.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.500
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.500
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.500
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
Don't apologize.

06:41.500 --> 06:46.500
From the moment I met you, not a day is gone by when I haven't thought of you.

06:46.500 --> 06:50.500
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just, I'm just scared Veronica.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
The thought of not being with you.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.500
I mean, I just can't handle it.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.500
We were made for each other Veronica.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.500
You're my everything.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.500
My soul mate.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.500
What can I do?

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
Just hold me.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.500
I'll always be here for you no matter what.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.500
And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
I believe in us, Steven.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
I'm so happy to hear that.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.500
I know we belong together.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.500
I love you so much.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.500
That was a little bit more clear this time.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.500
But now I want to look at some phrases in the dialogue.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.500
And see how they can be put together.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.500
Put you in together.

07:37.500 --> 07:44.500
So Veronica apologized to Steven for getting him worked up over nothing.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
Over nothing.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.500
Now it's the complete sentence.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.500
I'm sorry for getting you worked up over nothing.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.500
So over nothing means for no reason, right?

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500
Right exactly.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.500
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use over nothing?

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
Example one.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.500
You always get angry over nothing.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.500
You have such a bad temper.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.500
Example two.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.500
I called the police last night over nothing.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.500
I thought I had a thief in my house.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.500
Example three.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
Let's not fight over nothing.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
Let's just have dinner and peace.

08:30.500 --> 08:34.500
Okay, so we see you can use many different verbs together with over nothing.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.500
So get excited over nothing.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.500
Get angry over nothing.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
Get upset over nothing.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
Exactly.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.500
Very good.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
So over nothing.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.500
And now for our next phrase.

08:45.500 --> 08:49.500
So when Steven was telling Veronica how much he loved her,

08:49.500 --> 08:54.500
he told her not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
So not a day has gone by.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.500
So that part of the sentence, not a day has gone by.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.500
What does he mean by that?

09:01.500 --> 09:04.500
He means basically every day I think of you.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.500
There hasn't been a moment that I haven't thought of you.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.500
Now, how can we change it a little bit?

09:09.500 --> 09:11.500
What can we change within this phrase?

09:11.500 --> 09:13.500
Well, you can put in different times.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.500
Okay.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.500
So not a day has gone by.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.500
Not an hour has gone by.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.500
Not a moment has gone by.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.500
Not a month, not a year.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
Exactly.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.500
Okay.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
So you can use different times in that phrase.

09:25.500 --> 09:30.500
But an important thing is that the compliment is always negative, right?

09:30.500 --> 09:31.500
That's right.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
So it's always followed by a negative.

09:33.500 --> 09:37.500
Not a day has gone by that I haven't wished you were here.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
Okay.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
So it's followed by a negative.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.500
That's right.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.500
Maybe one more.

09:41.500 --> 09:45.500
Not a second has gone by that I haven't missed you.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
Okay.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.500
Very good examples.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.500
Very romantic.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.500
Oh, Marco.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
All right.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.500
And now our last phrase.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.500
He told her, I'll always be here for you no matter what.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.500
No matter what.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
No matter what.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
No matter what.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.500
No matter what.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.500
What does he mean by that?

10:01.500 --> 10:05.500
Well, regardless of or, you know, nothing's going to stop me.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Okay.

10:06.500 --> 10:10.500
So if I want to get that job, I'm going to get it no matter what.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
So nothing's going to stop you.

10:12.500 --> 10:16.500
Now, we can change the WH word at the end, right?

10:16.500 --> 10:17.500
Yes.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.500
Other ones.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.500
Exactly.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.500
So no matter where.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.500
No matter where you are, I will find you.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.500
Yeah.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.500
No matter when.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.500
No matter when your birthday is, I will be there.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
That's right.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.500
You can see how you can use different WH words here.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.500
Okay.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
Very good.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.500
And it's a very common phrase, right?

10:34.500 --> 10:35.500
No matter what.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.500
No matter where.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
No matter when.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.500
No matter why.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.500
No matter how.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
Yeah.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
No matter how.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.500
Okay.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
So those were some really great phrases.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.500
And I think you can play with them a little bit.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
Change some things.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.500
And then you can use them in your everyday life.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
That's right.

10:49.500 --> 11:02.500
Why don't we hear them again one more time in context with the dialogue.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.500
Thank God you showed up when you did.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.500
He's insane.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.500
Do you think we should call the police?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.500
I don't worry about it.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.500
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
I can't believe he was talking to you all these years.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
What a nut job.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.500
I know.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.500
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.500
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.500
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
Don't apologize.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.500
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.500
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just...

11:33.500 --> 11:35.500
I'm just scared Veronica.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.500
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.500
The thought of not being with you.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.500
I mean, I just can't handle it.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.500
We were made for each other Veronica.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
You're my everything.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.500
My soul mate.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.500
What can I do?

11:49.500 --> 11:50.500
Just hold me.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.500
I'll always be here for you no matter what.

11:53.500 --> 11:57.500
And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.500
I believe in our Stephen.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.500
I'm so happy to hear that.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.500
I know we belong together.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.500
I love you so much.

12:17.500 --> 12:27.500
Okay, Erica, so what do you think got shot?

12:27.500 --> 12:32.500
I don't know, but I'm starting to think this story is becoming a soap opera.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.500
Well, it certainly is, and well, what do you guys think happened?

12:35.500 --> 12:38.500
Or who do you think got shot or who did the shooting?

12:38.500 --> 12:39.500
Who shot who, maybe?

12:39.500 --> 12:41.500
What's it even a gunshot?

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
Maybe it was just a car.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.500
The tire could have popped.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.500
I don't know.

12:46.500 --> 12:51.500
So we'll come to our website, tell us what you think happens or what you would like to happen

12:51.500 --> 12:57.500
