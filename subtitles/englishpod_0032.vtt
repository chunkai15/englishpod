00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello, English learners. Welcome back to another great lesson with English pod. My name is Marco.

00:06.500 --> 00:11.500
And I'm Erica. And today we're bringing you another great lesson about being at the bank.

00:11.500 --> 00:19.000
That's right. We've got an intermediate lesson for you today with lots of great language to help you open a bank account.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Okay, so let's look at our vocabulary preview today.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.500
The vocabulary preview.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.500
Two words today. The first one is checking accounts.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.500
A checking account.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.000
Checking accounts.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
So what is a checking account?

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
Well, it's a type of bank account that lets you do your day-to-day or daily banking.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.500
So it's the normal bank account that you used to go shopping, they used to pay your bills.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.500
The opposite and our second word is...

00:49.500 --> 00:50.500
Savings accounts.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.500
Savings accounts.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.500
Savings accounts.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.500
So a savings account is too?

00:55.500 --> 00:57.500
It's a bank account where you save your money.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.500
To save money, right?

00:58.500 --> 01:01.500
So usually you don't touch the money in this account.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.500
Yeah, usually it stays in there.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.500
Right. So usually banks will have these two types of accounts.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.500
Yes.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.500
Checking and saving.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.500
Uh-huh.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.500
Okay, great. Let's listen to our dialogue a first time now.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.500
Right. Well, today we're at a bank.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.500
And we're going to listen as a man is opening a bank account.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.500
The dialogue is going to be spoken at a normal speed.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.500
So it might be a little bit fast.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.500
Yeah.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.500
But don't worry about it because we'll come back and explain everything.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.500
The next piece may help you, sir.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.500
Hello, we guess.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.500
I'd like to open a bank account.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.500
Certainly.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.500
I can help you with that.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.500
What type of account would you like to open?

01:35.500 --> 01:36.500
A checking or a saving account.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.500
What features do they offer?

01:38.500 --> 01:41.500
Well, if you just take a look here, see.

01:41.500 --> 01:45.500
Without checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.500
And our savings account has to have a lot of money.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.500
And our savings account has to have a lot of money.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.500
Without checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly

01:55.500 --> 01:56.500
fee.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.500
And our savings account has a higher interest rate.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.500
But you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.500
I see.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.500
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.500
I'd like to have easy access to my money.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.500
All right, then.

02:10.500 --> 02:14.500
With this checking account, you'll be issued a debit card and a checkbook.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.500
Will you require overdraft protection?

02:17.500 --> 02:19.500
There was an extra fee for that.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.500
No, that won't be necessary.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.500
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.500
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

02:33.500 --> 02:38.500
If you could just sign here and here, and here, we'll be all set.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.500
Would you like to make a deposit today?

02:40.500 --> 02:44.500
Yes, I'd like to deposit $1 billion.

02:44.500 --> 02:49.500
All right, $1 billion.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.500
That's a lot of money.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.500
That's a weird laugh.

02:52.500 --> 03:09.500
Okay, let's look at language takeaway today.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.500
Language takeaway.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.500
Today, we've got four words for you in language takeaway.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
All about money and banking.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.500
Money and banking.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.500
Uh-huh.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.500
The first one that we have today is transaction.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.500
Transaction.

03:24.500 --> 03:25.500
Transaction.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
Transaction.

03:27.500 --> 03:32.500
So we have some great examples that will help you understand what a transaction is.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.500
So let's listen.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.500
Example one.

03:36.500 --> 03:41.500
I need a record of my most recent bank transactions.

03:41.500 --> 03:48.500
Example two.

03:48.500 --> 03:55.500
There is no fee for bank transactions done online.

03:55.500 --> 04:00.500
Example three.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.500
Okay, we have deposited your money.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.500
Would you like to make another transaction today?

04:07.500 --> 04:13.500
So basically, I can understand that a transaction is moving money around in your bank accounts.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.500
Right, it's taking your money from right.

04:16.500 --> 04:22.500
It's taking money from your bank account and putting it in another account or just taking it to spend whatever.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.500
Yes.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.500
That's a transaction.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.500
Or even putting money into your bank account.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.500
That's also a transaction.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
Great.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
Our second word.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.500
Balance.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
Balance.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.500
Balance.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.500
Your account balance.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.500
How much money you have?

04:37.500 --> 04:38.500
Exactly.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.500
Right.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.500
At account balance.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.500
My account balance is $2.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.500
Right now, I think.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.500
That's a bit of a problem.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.500
Yes.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
Good thing payday is three days away.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
Yeah.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.500
Okay.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.500
Our third word overdraft.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
Overdraft.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.500
Overdraft.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.500
Overdraft.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.500
So this really comes in handy, right?

04:58.500 --> 04:59.500
Mm-hmm.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.500
To overdraft, can you tell us a little bit about it?

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
Let's say in my bank account, I have $500.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.500
Mm-hmm.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.500
But I spend $600.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.500
Right.

05:08.500 --> 05:13.500
So I have an overdraft in my account, meaning I owe the bank $100.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.500
Right.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.500
It's also commonly referred to as a negative balance.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.500
That's right.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.500
Right.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.500
Negative balance.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.500
Like me.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.500
Very soon I will have a negative balance.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.500
Okay.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.500
I think this one is a little bit tricky to understand.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.500
So let's listen to a couple of examples of how we use this word.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.500
Example one.

05:34.500 --> 05:41.500
The maximum overdraft in my account is only $5,000.

05:41.500 --> 05:46.500
Example two.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.500
I'm sorry sir, but you've exceeded your maximum overdraft limit.

05:49.500 --> 05:55.500
I cannot give you any more money.

05:55.500 --> 06:01.500
Example three.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.500
Oh no.

06:03.500 --> 06:10.500
I have to pay $1,500 in overdraft fees.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.500
Okay.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.500
Great examples.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Now we can take a look at our last word.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.500
debit card.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.500
debit card.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.500
debit card.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.500
D-E-B-I-T card.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.500
debit card.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.500
So debit card is issued by the bank.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.500
Yes.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
And use two.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.500
Take money out of a ATM.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.500
From an ATM machine, right?

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
A debit card.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
Not to be confused with a credit card.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.500
Not the same thing.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.500
Okay.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
Great.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.500
So now we could listen to our dialogue a second time.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
At a slower speed.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.500
So now we can hear all of the great language you just talked about.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.500
Next please.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.500
May I help you sir?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.500
Hello.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
Yes.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.500
I'd like to open a bank account.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.500
Certainly.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.500
I can help you with that.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.500
What type of account would you like to open?

07:08.500 --> 07:11.500
A checking or a savings account.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.500
What features do they offer?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.500
Well, if you just look here.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
See.

07:17.500 --> 07:22.500
With our checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
fee.

07:23.500 --> 07:27.500
And our savings account has a higher interest rate.

07:27.500 --> 07:32.500
But you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
I see.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.500
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.500
I like to have easy access to my money.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.500
Alright then.

07:43.500 --> 07:49.500
With this checking account, you'll be issued with a debit card and a check book.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.500
Will you require overdraft protection?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.500
There is an extra fee for that.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500
No.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.500
That won't be necessary.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.500
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

08:01.500 --> 08:07.500
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

08:07.500 --> 08:14.500
If you could just sign here and here and here, we'll be all set.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.500
Would you like to make a deposit today?

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
Yes.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.500
I'd like to deposit $1 billion.

08:27.500 --> 08:34.500
We heard some interesting phrases of how to tell somebody to do something in a polite way.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
Yes.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.500
So let's start with fluency builder and explain these words.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.500
Fluency builder.

08:41.500 --> 08:46.500
The bank teller asks this man to do a number of things in order to open his bank account.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.500
And she used some great expressions.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.500
Right.

08:50.500 --> 08:55.500
Let's listen to how she asks the man to do somethings in a polite way.

08:55.500 --> 09:00.500
I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

09:00.500 --> 09:05.500
I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

09:05.500 --> 09:09.500
I'll need your social insurance number.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.500
I'll need your social insurance number.

09:13.500 --> 09:20.500
If you could just sign here, if you could just sign here.

09:20.500 --> 09:24.500
So the first thing she said is, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.500
I'll get you to.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.500
Right.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.500
Right.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
I'll get you to.

09:29.500 --> 09:33.500
So it's just a way of saying, can you please fill this out?

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
Yeah.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.500
Do this.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.500
But in a different way.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
Uh-huh.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
More polite.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
It's pretty polite.

09:39.500 --> 09:43.500
Then she also said, I'll need your social insurance number.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.500
I'll need your.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
I'll need your.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.500
Again, a polite way of saying.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.500
Give me.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.500
Give social insurance number.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.500
Give me your social insurance number.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.500
Yeah.

09:52.500 --> 09:57.500
And the last thing she said, and this is really polite, if you could just sign here.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
Yes.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
If you could just sign here.

09:59.500 --> 10:04.500
If you could just, if you could just wait a moment, I'll be with you.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.500
If you could just send me an email with your bank account number.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.500
Right.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
Very polite way of asking for something.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
Yep.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.500
Well, some great language in today's cast.

10:13.500 --> 10:18.500
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll catch all of this wonderful language.

10:18.500 --> 10:28.500
Next piece.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.500
May I help you, sir?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
Hello, we yes.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.500
I'd like to open a bank account.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.500
Certainly.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.500
I can help you with that.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
What type of account would you like to open?

10:38.500 --> 10:40.500
A checking or a saving account.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.500
What features do they offer?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.500
Well, if you just take a look here, see.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.500
Without checking account, you can have unlimited daily transactions

10:47.500 --> 10:49.500
for a small monthly fee.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.500
And our savings account has a higher interest rate.

10:52.500 --> 10:56.500
But you must carry a minimum balance of $10,000.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
I see.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.500
Well, I think I'm more interested in a checking account.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.500
I'd like to have easy access to my money.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.500
Alright then.

11:04.500 --> 11:08.500
With this checking account, you'll be issued a debit card and a checkbook.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.500
Will you require overdraft protection?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
There was an extra fee for that.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
No, that won't be necessary.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.500
In that case, I'll get you to fill out this paperwork.

11:18.500 --> 11:22.500
I'll need your social insurance number and two pieces of government ID.

11:26.500 --> 11:32.500
If you could just sign here and here, and here, we'll be all set.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
Would you like to make a deposit today?

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
Yes.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.500
I'd like to deposit $1 billion.

11:38.500 --> 11:58.500
Okay, so an interesting thing here, not many countries use checks.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.500
That's right.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.500
Right.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
The checkbook or a check?

12:01.500 --> 12:04.500
Yeah, it tends to be more of an American thing, don't you think?

12:04.500 --> 12:05.500
It is.

12:05.500 --> 12:09.500
For those of you who aren't sure what a check is, it's basically a piece of paper

12:09.500 --> 12:11.500
that you just sign your name and...

12:11.500 --> 12:15.500
Yeah, you write the amount of money and then you sign your name, right?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.500
Right, and then you give that to the person that that person can take it to the bank

12:18.500 --> 12:20.500
and get money and exchange for it.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.500
Yes.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.500
It's not very common in other countries.

12:22.500 --> 12:26.500
No, but from what I know, every single American has a checkbook and use it.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
Right.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.500
Are you regular?

12:28.500 --> 12:29.500
Yeah, yeah.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.500
For example, you pay your phone bill or your electric bill,

12:32.500 --> 12:34.500
just put a check in the mailbox and...

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
Okay, it's done.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.500
It's an interesting thing.

12:36.500 --> 12:41.500
Also, sometimes, in other countries, people's salaries are paid through checks.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.500
Yes.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
Pay check.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.500
Oh, yes.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.500
I see where that word comes from.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.500
Pay check.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
Aha.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.500
But for example, here in China, it's not very common, right?

12:49.500 --> 12:50.500
I've never seen a check here.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
Me neither.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
What about in your countries?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.500
We'd like to know how the banking system works.

12:54.500 --> 12:58.500
Yes, come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us all about it.

12:58.500 --> 13:02.500
Yes, and you can also leave your questions in comments on our website and we'll

13:02.500 --> 13:03.500
be there to answer it.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
Yeah, Marco and I love answering your questions.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.500
So please visit us.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
Right.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
But until then, it's...

13:08.500 --> 13:09.500
Goodbye.
