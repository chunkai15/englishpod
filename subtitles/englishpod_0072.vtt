Hello English learners. Welcome back to EnglishPod. My name is Marko.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
And I'm Erica. And today we're bringing you a great office lesson.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
That's right, but actually I hope this situation never happens to any of our listeners.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Exactly. Today we are firing somebody.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Thanks.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
It is a little bit complicated, but maybe you're a nature manager,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
maybe you're a supervisor, and you'll have to do this one day.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
So, gotta learn how, right?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Exactly.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Well, why don't we get started then?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
As we listen to Isabelle and Anthony.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Hi, Isabelle. You wanted to see me?

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Yes, Anthony. Come on in and have a seat.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Is everything okay? You seem a bit preoccupied.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Okay.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just going to come out with it.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
We're going to have to let you go.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
What? Why? I mean, just like that, I'm fired?

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
What? I resent that.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
You called in sick eight times this month.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
And you smell like alcohol.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
He did sound a little bit like he had too much to drink.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I know he had that kind of slur.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, the slow way of talking that made him seem a little bit drunk.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
Well, that's definitely something you don't want to do is show up to work with alcohol in your breath.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Exactly, but you know what? There's a lot of great language in this dialogue.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
So why don't we take a look at it now in language takeaway?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Language takeaway.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
All right. Well, I want to look at three words here.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Now the first one, Anthony said that Isabelle was preoccupied.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
preoccupied.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
preoccupied.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay, so if somebody is preoccupied, they're not focused.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Maybe they're a little bit worried.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah, they're thinking of something else.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Okay. What do we take a listen to a few examples of how this word is used?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Example one.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
James is really preoccupied. I think he's having some family problems.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Example two.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Oh, were you talking to me, honey? I'm sorry.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm just really preoccupied with work.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
All right, so very clear now preoccupied. Let's move on to our next word, direct impact.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Direct impact.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
A direct impact.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
All right, so again, Isabelle told Anthony that the decision will have a direct impact on his career.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Mm-hmm.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
It will have a noticeable or impact or effect on his career.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Okay, so a direct impact.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
And what about our last word?

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, Anthony said, I resent that.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Resent.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Resent.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Okay, now this is spelled exactly like recent, like with an S, right?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
That's right.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
R-E-S-E-N-T.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
But you pronounce it like a Z.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Resent.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Resent that.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
So what does it mean if you say I resent that?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
It means I find that insulting.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I find that to be not true.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yes.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Okay.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I resent.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
All right, Marco, well, how do you use this word?

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Well, if somebody tells you you're lazy.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Okay.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Right.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Then you might say, hey, I resent that.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Right. I do a lot of work. I'm not lazy.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, so it's always something that you use after someone insults you.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Right.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Or says something that you find to be not true.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Okay.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Resent that.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
And I guess with this, it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
And then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Hey, Isabelle, you wanted to see me?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Yes, Anthony.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Come on in and have a seat.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Is everything okay?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
You seem a bit preoccupied.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Well, Anthony.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
This is not going to be an easy conversation.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Okay.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just going to come out with it.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
We're going to have to let you go.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
What? Why?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I mean, just like that.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm fired?

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
What?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I resent that.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
You called in sick eight times this month.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
And you smell like alcohol.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
There's some wonderful language in here that you can use when you have to have a difficult conversation with somebody.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Right. So let's take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Fluency Builder.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
We have three phrases here.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
And the first one is to beat around the bush.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Okay. Beat around the bush.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Beat around the bush.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Okay.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
So this is an idiomatic phrase.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
So before we explain it, let's listen to somebody beating around the bush.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Okay. The one thing that I want to tell you,

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
it's so important that I don't like.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
They, I always, sometimes when,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
all right, here's a deal. This is it.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Specifically, it's not this. It's not that.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
It's not you. It's not me.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
It's everyone. It's everything.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
You understand what I'm saying?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
So as you can tell, the person has something to say,

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
but they're taking a long time to say it.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Right. You're kind of looking for the right or maybe more polite words to say something.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Exactly.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So that is to beat around the bush.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Now the opposite of to beat around the bush is to come out with it.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Okay. Come out with it.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Come out with it.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
So maybe you're talking to your friend and he's beating around the bush.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
So you can just say, hey, come out with it.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Tell me. Tell me. Just what is it?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Exactly.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Right. Come out with it. Be direct.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
When is it about finally came out with it?

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
She told Anthony that we're going to have to let you go.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Let you go.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Let you go.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
So this is actually a nicer way of saying your fire.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah. It's a little bit more polite, isn't it?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Right. We're going to have to let you go or...

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Oh, I was let go from my company.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Right. So a synonym for to be fired.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Exactly.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Okay. So let's listen to Anthony getting fired one more time.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this difficult situation.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
Hey, Isabelle, you wanted to see me?

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
Yes, Anthony. Come on in and have a seat.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Is everything okay? You seem a bit preoccupied.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Okay.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just going to come out with it.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
We're going to have to let you go.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
What? Why? I mean, just like that, I'm fired?

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
What? I resent that.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
You called in sick eight times this month.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
And you smell like alcohol.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So Erica, have you ever fired anyone?

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
I have fired a lot of people. Oh, wow. You are a mean person.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, there are some people who really do silly things like come to work drunk.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And if you do that, you're obviously going to get fired.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah. But in the United States, actually, there is an interesting way of firing people.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
They get a pink slip. Oh, yeah.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
But I guess this is just a little bit different than getting fired.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
You get a pink slip when you get laid off.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Right. I mean, if you come to work drunk, you get fired immediately, right?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
But when you get a pink slip.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
So it's basically a little pink paper that tells you that you have been laid off.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
And so when you hear somebody say, we sent out,

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
yeah. So when you hear somebody talk about pink slips, like we sent like our company sent out 500 pink slips,

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
you know that means that 500 people got laid off.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Or I got a pink slip today. That means you got laid off.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
Right. That's actually interesting because I don't know any other country that actually has this.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
A special color.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Special color for firing people.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah. How about in your country? Is there a special color for pink slips?

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
If you guys have any stories as well, maybe about being fired,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
or maybe you've had to fire somebody.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Come to our website and tell us about it.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
