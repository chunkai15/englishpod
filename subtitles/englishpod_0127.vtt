00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Hello English learners. Welcome back to English.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.000
Pod, my name is Marco.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.800
And my name is Katherine and today we've got a great show for you.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.200
We're talking all about music.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.400
It's a great topic. I think everyone loves music.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.800
And well, there's so much type of music out there.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.800
So that's what we're going to be talking about today.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.600
Exactly. So there's a little bit for everyone here.

00:21.600 --> 00:27.200
Even if you hate rock music, there might be something in it that you're going to be a fan of.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.800
Right. So before we get started on the dialogue,

00:30.800 --> 00:32.800
we have a couple of words that we want to preview.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.000
So let's take a look at them now in vocabulary preview.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.240
Very vocabulary preview.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.560
All right. So this word sounds a bit funny.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.800
It looks like it should be pronounced differently.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.360
We say genre genre.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.280
Or genre is kind of sounds French.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.520
Is it French? I think it comes from French.

00:50.160 --> 00:55.440
It's a G-E word. So genre, it's a soft, soft sound.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
And what's a genre?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Well, a genre is like a category.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.680
So you could say genre of book or genre of music?

01:03.680 --> 01:05.440
Oh, movies also have genres, right?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.280
Yeah, they do. It's like horror movie.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.240
Is it genre?

01:08.240 --> 01:11.040
Okay, or action, or suspense, et cetera.

01:11.040 --> 01:14.240
So we're going to be looking at music genres on this occasion.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.520
And some of these genre names actually have abbreviations.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.880
They're their long words that we say in short forms.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.760
And this kind of abbreviation is called an acronym.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.680
All right, so that's another word that we're looking at acronym.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.880
So an acronym is a short version of a long word.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.880
Yeah, usually it's just letters.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.520
Like USA is a very good acronym.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.240
It means United States of America.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.440
All right, cool.

01:39.440 --> 01:43.200
So there are some acronyms as well in music.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.520
So that's what we're going to be looking at in many other things.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.200
I guess like DNA is an acronym.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.800
Yeah, DNA is an acronym.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.720
UN is an acronym.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.520
All right, great.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.800
So we're going to be looking at different genres of music.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.680
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

01:57.680 --> 02:03.280
We're going to listen to a game show where people have to name the song and the genre.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.000
Welcome back, music lovers.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.440
To I love that song, the game show, where we test your musical knowledge

02:19.440 --> 02:20.800
to the extreme.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.000
Let's get started.

02:22.000 --> 02:22.720
TMA.

02:22.720 --> 02:23.520
Guess this, too.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.640
Uh, caring your love with me by George Strait.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.800
The genre is country music.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.600
You're right.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.760
100 points to team A.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.680
Now for our next cut.

02:42.640 --> 02:50.320
Oh, no, no, no, no, let me see that song sung by Cisco.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.480
I believe the genre is R and B.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.120
100 big points for team B.

02:55.120 --> 03:00.240
For all of our viewers, the acronym R and B stands for rhythm and blues on that note.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.760
DJ, play our next song.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.440
Superstar by the Carpenters.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.040
And the genre.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.120
Adult contemporary?

03:15.120 --> 03:16.800
That's right, 100 points.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.560
Uh-oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.040
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.800
Let's hear our next song.

03:32.080 --> 03:37.520
To I see that song is Kingslayer by the finished power metal group NightWish.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.960
You are correct, very impressive team A.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.480
And it seems we have a tie.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.520
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.520
Each team will be played three songs, and they must tell us the genre of each song

03:49.520 --> 03:51.520
in less than five seconds, TMA.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.720
Are you ready?

03:52.720 --> 03:53.840
Ready.

03:53.840 --> 03:54.720
Let's hear it.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.280
Hip-hop, classical and gothic metal.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.320
You're right.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.160
Team B, the pressure is on.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.440
If you get all of them right, we will move on to Sunder.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.440
If you miss one, you lose.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.800
DJ, let's hear it.

04:20.800 --> 04:37.360
Rap, disco, and...

04:37.520 --> 04:50.720
Fun show, Marco.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.520
I kind of think I'd be good at this kind of game.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.120
I might win big.

04:55.120 --> 05:00.720
Well, there were a lot of different types of genres in there, and a lot of different music.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.120
I don't know, maybe not very popular.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.800
Like, for example, country music.

05:04.800 --> 05:09.920
I don't know if many people outside of the United States actually know about this.

05:09.920 --> 05:14.400
Well, there might be different kinds of country music, but in America, one of the most famous

05:14.400 --> 05:16.720
country music musicians is Garth Brooks.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.080
And even if I didn't like his music, I grew up hearing it everywhere.

05:20.080 --> 05:20.960
But you don't like it.

05:20.960 --> 05:25.520
You know, it's one of those things that I like some kinds of country music.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.520
But it's a huge genre.

05:27.520 --> 05:31.040
That means there's lots of different kinds of music within country.

05:31.040 --> 05:31.840
All right.

05:31.840 --> 05:36.400
Well, let's take a look at more of these genres, and now in language takeaway.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.120
Language takeaway.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.720
All right, so we talked about country music.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.520
Now, this is mostly in the United States, right?

05:45.520 --> 05:51.600
And the South especially, because there's a long tradition of country music in the Southern United States.

05:51.600 --> 05:57.760
So it's very characteristic to have guitars and a little bit of twang, maybe.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.360
Twang, what is twang?

06:00.320 --> 06:02.160
It's a way of saying a word.

06:02.160 --> 06:07.280
So I could say, I'm from Texas, or I could say, I'm from Texas.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.080
That's twang.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.440
That's twang.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.840
So it kind of like an accent, a Southern accent.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.400
Yeah, so Garth Brooks has a famous twang.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.960
I got friends in love.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.000
You know, that's a very famous song of his, where he's twangy.

06:20.000 --> 06:20.880
Very Southern.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.360
Yeah.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.600
All right, so we have country music.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.480
And then we saw another genre, which is R&B.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.840
Okay, this is a little bit more up my alley.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.640
I mean, this is more of an interest of mine.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.880
Yeah, and R&B is an acronym for rhythm and blues.

06:36.880 --> 06:41.520
All right, so the R&B that we know now would be some examples of those artists.

06:41.520 --> 06:46.720
Well, a really famous artist is John Legend, who's been touring the world, but his new album.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.640
And that kind of music is R&B.

06:48.640 --> 06:54.080
So we're talking about a kind of music that mixes jazz traditions with rhythm.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.320
So that means drums and bass.

06:56.320 --> 06:56.960
Okay.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.320
Down, down, down, right.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.200
Down, that's rhythm.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.640
So you have rhythm and blues.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.200
So like the name says R&B.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.800
Very popular nowadays.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.360
Oh, and then, and then we moved on to something heavier.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.200
Something more like rock style, which is metal.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.960
Metal, okay, I'm not really sure why they call it metal, but metal is a very,

07:14.960 --> 07:16.800
very popular kind of music.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.360
So it divides into different categories, right?

07:19.360 --> 07:21.600
In this song, we saw that it was power metal.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.080
Yeah.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.920
But you also have like heavy metal.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.680
Well, because metal is such a broad category.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.200
It's a big category.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.960
It's hard to say what certain groups are unless you're really a fan and you follow.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.680
But there are many different kinds of metal out there.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.240
And so if you're interested, I would check it out with a PDF.

07:38.240 --> 07:43.040
Yeah, or let us know if you know of what's the difference between power metal and gothic metal

07:43.040 --> 07:45.040
and electronic metal.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.680
So there are so many different types now.

07:47.680 --> 07:52.560
But moving on to our next genre, we also saw something that everyone probably knows

07:52.640 --> 07:54.640
nowadays, and that's hip hop.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.800
Yeah, hip hop is a great, great, and very interesting kind of music,

07:58.800 --> 08:03.120
grew out of a lot of people who are listening to jazz in the late 80s,

08:03.120 --> 08:05.600
especially in New York, I think Brooklyn.

08:05.600 --> 08:09.360
And it's kind of interesting in the sense that you take these old records,

08:09.360 --> 08:14.160
these old vinyls, and you slow everything down, right?

08:14.160 --> 08:15.280
So you change the speed.

08:15.280 --> 08:21.120
So a normal song goes from down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, and then you

08:21.120 --> 08:22.800
had like some bass in there.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.760
Yeah, exactly.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.040
And some lyrics, and you have yourself something like hip hop.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.800
So a very famous hip hop artist nowadays would be 50 cent.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.920
Yeah, or for example, also Nelly, right?

08:33.920 --> 08:35.920
Another famous hip hop artist.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.400
Yeah.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.160
So we have hip hop.

08:38.160 --> 08:42.240
And it's kind of similar, I don't know, very similar to rap almost.

08:42.240 --> 08:46.320
Yeah, but it's different in that the way the process for making this kind of music is quite

08:46.320 --> 08:47.040
different.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.960
Yeah, rap tends to be very lyric-heavy, whereas hip hop is very beat-heavy.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.960
I think.

08:51.960 --> 08:52.960
Right.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.040
So, interesting note, we've seen a lot of these different genres, but of course there's

08:57.040 --> 09:01.840
so many more that we can't really look at all of them in one single podcast.

09:01.840 --> 09:02.840
That's what our website is for.

09:02.840 --> 09:07.880
You can put your favorite music genres up on our website and practice your English.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.880
Exactly.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.080
So, well, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the second time, let's slow it down just a

09:13.080 --> 09:16.320
little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.000
Welcome back, music lovers, too.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.880
I love that song, the game show, where we test your musical knowledge to the extreme.

09:27.880 --> 09:28.880
Let's get started.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.880
T-may.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.880
Guess this tune.

09:31.880 --> 09:37.800
Ah, uh, carrying your love with me by George Strait, the genre is country music.

09:37.800 --> 09:38.800
You're right.

09:38.800 --> 09:44.000
100 points to team A, now for our next cut.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.520
Thong song by Cisco.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.960
I believe the genre is R&B.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.400
100 big points for team B.

09:50.400 --> 09:55.520
We're all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for with them and blues on that note.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.320
DJ, play our next song.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.640
Super star by the carpenters.

10:00.640 --> 10:06.280
And the genre, um, um, adult contemporary?

10:06.280 --> 10:07.280
That's right.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.280
100 points.

10:08.280 --> 10:12.720
Uh-oh, that sound means it's double in nothing.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.280
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.920
Let's hear our next song.

10:17.920 --> 10:23.280
Do we see that song is Kingslayer by the finished power metal group Nightwish?

10:23.280 --> 10:28.280
You are correct, very impressive, team A. And it seems we have a tie.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.520
It's time now for the tie raker round.

10:31.520 --> 10:35.520
Each team will be played three songs, and they must tell us the genre of each song in

10:35.520 --> 10:36.720
less than five seconds.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.720
T-may.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.720
Are you ready?

10:38.720 --> 10:39.720
Ready.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.000
Let's hear it.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.120
Hip hop, classical and gothic metal.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.120
You're right.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.920
Team B, the pressure is on.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.280
If you get all of them right, we will move on to sudden death.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.120
If you miss one, you lose.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.320
DJ, let's hear it.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.360
Wrap, disco, and end.

10:57.360 --> 11:05.080
So it is in a true English podcast, and if we don't give you a couple of phrases and words

11:05.080 --> 11:08.840
to make you sound more fluent, so that's the purpose of this next portion of our

11:08.840 --> 11:09.840
show.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.840
Fluency Builder.

11:12.240 --> 11:17.000
OK, so the phrases that we're going to look at now on Fluency Builder are the ones

11:17.000 --> 11:21.440
that we saw in the dialogue, but we can use, of course, outside of music or outside of

11:21.440 --> 11:23.240
a game show.

11:23.240 --> 11:27.640
And there was an interesting one that he mentioned when he said, double or nothing.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.640
Double or nothing.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.640
It's double or nothing.

11:29.640 --> 11:35.440
Well, this is an interesting phrase because it, I think, comes from gambling and betting.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.440
Mm-hmm.

11:36.440 --> 11:41.160
Yeah, so it's a way for us to say, well, you could double your money.

11:41.160 --> 11:44.920
But if you have a bad answer, if you lose this round, you don't get anything.

11:44.920 --> 11:45.920
Right.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.600
So I guess, yeah, you do see a lot of people say, maybe they're betting or they're

11:49.600 --> 11:53.680
playing a game, that person loses and said, OK, let's go double or nothing.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.920
So give me one more shot to win back my money.

11:55.920 --> 11:56.920
Right.

11:56.920 --> 12:02.560
So if I say, OK, Mark, or you need to tell me the capital of Brazil, you have $50.

12:02.560 --> 12:06.640
If you get the answer, right, you get $100, but if you get the answer wrong, you get

12:06.640 --> 12:07.640
zero.

12:07.640 --> 12:08.640
Right.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.640
That's double or nothing.

12:09.640 --> 12:10.640
Right.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.640
Interesting phrase.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.640
What else do we have?

12:12.640 --> 12:15.640
We've got a great one here called tiebreaker.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.640
So a tiebreaker.

12:16.640 --> 12:17.640
Yeah, a tiebreaker.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.240
It's a thing.

12:19.240 --> 12:23.200
And sometimes in games, some people have the same score.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.680
They have the same amount of points.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
So they're tied.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.680
They're tied.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.080
A tie means you have the same number.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.400
And if you want to win, you need one winner.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.760
You have to have a tiebreaker to decide.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.120
So you could be a question or like, we saw here a tiebreaker round.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.120
Yeah.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.840
This is side on the winner.

12:39.840 --> 12:44.000
And this is all, and I think because if you get the answer right, you win.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.320
If you don't, you lose.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.680
It doesn't matter if you were tied before.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.680
Right.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.680
All right.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.680
A tiebreaker.

12:50.680 --> 12:51.840
And we have one more phrase.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.040
And this one is really interesting.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.880
The pressure is on.

12:55.880 --> 12:56.880
Mm.

12:56.880 --> 13:00.640
So if I say the pressure is on, it almost sounds painful.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.640
Yeah.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.640
It does.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.640
Well, is it?

13:03.640 --> 13:05.040
Does it mean that I am being pressured?

13:05.040 --> 13:06.040
What is this?

13:06.040 --> 13:07.240
Well, so it's a good question.

13:07.240 --> 13:13.120
The important thing to look at here is the word on because pressure has this kind of

13:13.120 --> 13:18.040
companion word to put pressure on something or to put pressure on someone.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.960
And so it's the way we say it in English.

13:19.960 --> 13:26.160
And it means that you're going to really take things seriously from this point on.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.160
Okay.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.160
Right.

13:28.160 --> 13:33.440
So for example, the Chicago Bulls were at the peak, the height of their fame, and they

13:33.440 --> 13:35.080
were just a wonderful team.

13:35.080 --> 13:40.120
And oftentimes, you'd hear the announcer say there's five seconds left on the clock.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.280
The pressure is on Michael Jordan to win the game.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.280
All right.

13:44.280 --> 13:48.240
So the opportunity for the team to win all dependent on Michael Jordan.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.240
Right.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.280
So the pressure, all of this stuff is on him.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.280
His shoulders.

13:52.280 --> 13:55.000
So he has to score the point to win the game.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Okay.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.800
This is a very interesting phrase.

13:57.800 --> 14:03.720
Why don't we take a look at some other examples of how we could use the pressure is on.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.320
Example one.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.600
Carl is really stressed out lately.

14:08.600 --> 14:14.280
The pressure of the entire project is on him since his promotion.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.760
Example two.

14:16.760 --> 14:22.640
The pressure is on the president to guide his country out of the recession.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.960
Example three.

14:25.960 --> 14:30.640
The pressure is on our entire team to successfully come up with a new product for the Asian

14:30.640 --> 14:33.640
market within a month.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.640
All right.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.640
Great examples.

14:35.640 --> 14:36.640
Great phrases.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.040
I think it's a pretty clear now, right?

14:38.040 --> 14:39.040
It is.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.840
And to make sure that we understood the whole dialogue, I think we should take another

14:41.840 --> 14:43.880
lesson to it at a normal speed.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.600
And when we come back, we're talking a little bit more about one of my favorite topics

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
music.

14:49.600 --> 14:58.600
Music.

14:58.600 --> 15:03.360
Welcome back music lovers to I love that song the game show where we test your musical

15:03.360 --> 15:05.360
knowledge to the extreme.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.360
Let's get started.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.360
TMA.

15:07.360 --> 15:16.360
Guess this tune.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.120
Carrying your love with me by George Strait.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.360
The genre is country music.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.360
You're right.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.360
100 points to team A.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.160
Now for our next cut.

15:26.160 --> 15:34.720
Let me see that song sung by Cisco.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.120
I believe the genre is R&B.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.600
100 big points for team B.

15:39.600 --> 15:44.760
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues on that note.

15:44.760 --> 15:51.800
DJ play our next song.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.160
Superstar by the Carpenters.

15:54.160 --> 15:58.440
And the genre.

15:58.440 --> 15:59.840
Adult contemporary?

15:59.840 --> 16:00.840
That's right.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.840
100 points.

16:02.840 --> 16:09.040
Uh-oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.600
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

16:11.600 --> 16:16.680
Let's hear our next song.

16:16.680 --> 16:22.000
Do we see that song is Kingslayer by the finished power metal group Nightwish.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.960
You are correct, very impressive team A, and it seems we have a tie.

16:26.960 --> 16:30.080
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.960
Each team will be played three songs, and they must tell us the genre of each song

16:33.960 --> 16:35.400
in less than five seconds.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
TMA.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.400
Are you ready?

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
Ready.

16:38.400 --> 16:38.920
Let's hear it.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.800
Hip-hop, classical, and gothic metal.

16:55.800 --> 16:56.800
You're right.

16:56.800 --> 17:02.000
Team B, the pressure is on if you get all of them right, we will move on to Sunda.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
If you miss one.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
You lose.

17:04.000 --> 17:18.520
DJ, let's hear it.

17:18.520 --> 17:35.320
Rap, disco, and end.

17:35.320 --> 17:41.480
All right, so we have music, different music genres, which one are you mostly into?

17:41.480 --> 17:44.720
As a heart question, I have very different interests.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.160
I like classical music.

17:46.160 --> 17:52.640
I like jazz, but I also rock, and I also like R&B, so I guess it depends on your mood.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.640
Absolutely.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.480
Now they say that music does really influence people's moods.

17:57.480 --> 18:02.480
They did a study, some doctors in America did a study to see if heart patients, people

18:02.480 --> 18:07.920
who have heart problems, could be positively affected by music, and the results said

18:07.920 --> 18:10.520
that yes, it can be helpful.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.280
So maybe it helps them relax, or...

18:13.280 --> 18:17.960
Yeah, it says if you're losing to the radio, and a song that you like comes on the

18:17.960 --> 18:26.160
radio, you hear the song, your heart pumps more oxygen to your brain, so it actually

18:26.160 --> 18:27.560
makes you happier.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.560
Wow.

18:28.560 --> 18:33.200
What about when they play music for unborn babies, like the little headphones on the mother's

18:33.200 --> 18:38.000
belly, and they'll play classical music, because supposedly it'll make the baby smarter.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.320
Baby Mozart, or something?

18:39.320 --> 18:40.320
Yeah, exactly.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.320
What do you think about that?

18:41.320 --> 18:43.320
I don't know.

18:43.320 --> 18:47.640
I think talking to kids and giving them books with my little probably helps a little

18:47.640 --> 18:51.440
bit more, but I'm not a doctor, so that I can't say.

18:51.440 --> 18:56.400
Well, many people do argue now that they don't make music like they used to, I guess.

18:56.400 --> 19:02.000
They say that music that was made before the lyrics were more profound, they were real

19:02.000 --> 19:07.400
musicians, they were composers, and they wrote lyrics, but now you just get a lot of

19:07.400 --> 19:11.280
temporary music that doesn't really transcend into the future.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
What do you think?

19:12.280 --> 19:13.280
I totally disagree.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.960
I think the last 10 years have seen an amazing growth in the music industry because

19:17.960 --> 19:20.280
more people are communicating.

19:20.280 --> 19:25.080
The internet allows us to hear all sorts of things from all over the world, and so we have

19:25.080 --> 19:30.200
great musicians who can listen to music from molly, and they can listen to music from

19:30.200 --> 19:34.840
India, and they have all these different influences that we're not there before.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.480
And so I think it's the opposite.

19:36.480 --> 19:40.960
I think a lot of new pathways in music have opened up because of the technology evolution.

19:40.960 --> 19:41.960
Wow, interesting.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.600
Well, what do you guys think?

19:43.600 --> 19:47.800
Listeners, come to our website, english.com, leave your questions and comments and

19:47.800 --> 19:48.800
tell us what you think.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.880
Do you think maybe music has become better in the last decade or do you think maybe

19:52.880 --> 19:53.880
it's not so good?

19:53.880 --> 19:56.080
Well, you do have bad artists, right?

19:56.080 --> 19:58.080
You always have bad artists.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.080
Yeah.

19:59.080 --> 20:03.360
It's the bad ones they fade into history, you never hear from them again.

20:03.360 --> 20:07.040
So come and let us know, and also if you have any questions or doubts, you can leave them

20:07.040 --> 20:08.040

20:08.040 --> 20:11.520
Yeah, we're happy to answer any questions you've got, so let us know what you're thinking.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.640
All right, we'll see you guys there, and until next time, bye everyone.
