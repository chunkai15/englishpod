00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello everyone, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
And I'm Erica.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
And today we're going back to school.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
That's right, so we're talking about my least favorite subject.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
That would be math.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
That's right.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Okay, so we're going to be talking about math.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Now, I know that many of you, of course, no math.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Right.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
But do you know the operations in English?

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
Many people find it hard to find the right words to talk about math in English.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Right.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
And we'll also look at some names that you can call people who are really, really, really smart.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
And then we'll come back and look at those math words.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Alright, children, let's review.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Tommy, pay attention.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Sorry, Miss Cadillac.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
What's 4?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Plus 11.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
15.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Miss Cadillac always has crystal.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
She's such a teacher's pet.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Okay.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
And what about 56 minus 60?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm a negative 4.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Very good.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
12 times 12?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Very good.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
So good.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What about 44?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Zero divided by 1.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Zero.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
How did you know that?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Okay, smarty pants.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
The square root of 2.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
But you're not going to get that one.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Do it all.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Um, um.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Well, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, d5.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Alright, so that's one smart little girl, huh?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah, pretty smart.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Actually smarter than me.

01:56.000 --> 02:07.000
Alright, so let's take a look at some of those words that the teacher used to ask her about certain operations in language takeaway.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Language takeaway.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Okay, so like we said, you guys know how to do math.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And you know the words in your language.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
But maybe in English, it's a little bit harder to find the right words.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
So let's look at those now.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay, so let's look at the first question that she asked.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
What's 4 plus 11?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
4 plus 11.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Okay, plus plus.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Alright, so 4 plus 11 Erica is, let me take a look at here.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Um, 15.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
15.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Okay, so we are adding, right?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yes.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
So that's how you would say.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Let's go with an easy one.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
2 plus 2, 4, right?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Or 5 plus 5.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
10.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
10, okay.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
You're really testing my skills.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
So that's how you would add numbers.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Now what about taking away numbers?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
So taking away or subtracting.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Alright, let's test you again.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
In the dialogue, she said 56 minus 60.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Okay, minus 60 equals negative 4.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Okay.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Minus.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
So that's negative, right?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Minus.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
So, and of course, if you have 56 apples and you take away 60, you are left with negative 4.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, actually, you're left with zero apple.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Exactly.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Now, that answer is also interesting.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Negative 4.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Negative 4.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
That means minus 4, right?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
4 less than zero.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Very good.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Negative 4.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Okay.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
So now for our next operation.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
12 times 12.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
12 times 12.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
12 times 12.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Now Marko, don't ask me the answer.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Alright.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
12 times 12 equals 144.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Now that's multiplying.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Right.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Or multiplication.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Multiplication.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Okay.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
So this time is part.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
It's very easy to remember because, for example, four times four.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
You can just say four, the number four, and you add it, right?

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Four times four times four plus four plus four plus four.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Right.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
So times times.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Uh-huh.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Now the opposite of times.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Alright.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
The opposite of multiplication is division.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Division.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Okay.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
So in our dialogue, the teacher said zero divided by one.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Zero divided by one.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Zero divided by one.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Any number divided by zero is zero.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Alright.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
So let's give another example.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
15 divided by three.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Alright.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
So 15 divided by three equals five.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Five.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Exactly.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
So divided by divided by.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Very good.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
So after division, the teacher was very impressed.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
And now she asked a very hard mathematical operation,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
especially for a girl at this age.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
The square root of two.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
The square root of square root.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
So let's give some examples to show what is the square root.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
So if I ask you the square root of nine.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Three.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Three.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Yes.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
What about the square root of four?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Two.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Okay.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
So now one more.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
The square root of 16.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Four.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Hmm.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Okay.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
So you notice the pattern.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Sure.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Everyone knows this in their own language.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
How you would get a square root.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Exactly.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
So this language is pretty simple.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
You all know it in your own language.

05:43.000 --> 05:53.000
But let's hear it again in English one more time with the dialogue.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Alright.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Children.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Let's review.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Tommy.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Pay attention.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Sorry.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Miss Cadillac.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Okay.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Crystal.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Four.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Plus 11.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Um.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
15.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Miss Cadillac.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Always as crystal.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
She's such a teacher's pet.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Okay.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
And what about 56 and minus 60?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Um.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Negative four.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Very good.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
12 times 12.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Very good.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Sock up.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
144.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Zero divided by one.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Zero.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
How did you know that?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Okay.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Smarty pants.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
The square root of two.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
But you're not going to get that one.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Do it all.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Um.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
144.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
125.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Okay.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
So we understand the mathematical operations that we saw here.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Very easy.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
But now there was another little kid in there who was very, I think, Envious or jealous.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Tommy.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Right.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
So he called her a couple of different names.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Fluency Builder.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Okay.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So the first one that he called Crystal the little girl.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
He called her a teacher's pet.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Teachers pet.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Teachers pet.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
A teacher's pet.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
So Erica, what exactly is a teacher's pet?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
It is the favorite student.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
The teacher has in that class.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
All right.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
So it's always a student that's helping the teacher.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
The teacher's pet.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
And it has a negative meaning and English.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I wouldn't say that it's a good thing to be the teacher's pet.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Like the teacher thinks it's good.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
But all of the friends and the classmates.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
They think it's bad.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Exactly.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Teachers pet.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
And similar to teacher's pet is a suck up.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Suck up.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Suck up.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Again, suck up.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
What is this?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
What is a suck up?

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
A suck up is a person who tries really, really hard to make the teacher.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Like him.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Okay.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Now, we can also use it outside of the classroom, right?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
At work, maybe.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
There is always at work.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
There is always one person who's the suck up, right?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yes.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Now, again, this has a negative meaning and English.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
I guess in the workplace, the rest of your colleagues don't really like that person who's

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
considered to be the suck up.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Was always trying to please the boss.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Exactly.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
All right.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
All right.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
So the teacher calls Crystal a smarty pants.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Smarty pants.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Smarty pants.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Okay.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
So this is also a little named calling, right?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
So what is a smarty pants?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Somebody who is too smart.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Too smart.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Who tries too hard to be smart?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Now, this is only for little kids, right?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I wouldn't call you a smarty pants.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
No.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
It's definitely for children.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Adults don't say this.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Unless maybe you are joking or having fun with someone.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
But if you say it, you are suggesting that you're being like a child.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Right.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Okay.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Smarty pants.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
And our last one.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And this is also a very good phrase.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And a way to describe someone.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Know it all.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Know it all.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Know it all.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I know it all.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Sometimes you say, Mr. Know it all, right?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
That's right.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Okay.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
So what is a know it all?

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Somebody who tries to show everyone that they know it all.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
They know everything.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
They have the answers.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
But they really, really try and show everyone that they know everything.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
These people can be sometimes a little bit irritating, right?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Very, very annoying.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Knowing.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
All right.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
So it's not a good thing to be a know it all the time.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Actually, all of these phrases are not good things to be.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Okay.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
So let's listen to our dialogue one more time.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
And then we're going to come back.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
And Eric is going to tell us how much she hates math.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
All right, children.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Let's review.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Tommy.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Pay attention.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Sorry, Miss Cadillac.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Okay, Crystal.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Now tell me.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
What's four?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Plus eleven.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Um.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
15.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Miss Cadillac.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Oh, it's crystal.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
She's such a teacher's pet.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Okay.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
And what about 56 and minus 60?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Um.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Negative four.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Very good.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
12 times 12?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Very good.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
So good.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Why?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Zero divided by one.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Zero.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
How did you know that?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Okay.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Smarty pants.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
The square root of two.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
If you're not going to get that one, do it all.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Um.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Um.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Well, four.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
One, four.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Two, one.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
All right.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
So, Erica, you were telling me that you hated math.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Or you still do?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Well, yes.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I really do hate math.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
And even doing a simple, um, you know, like 16 plus 32 is too hard for me.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
So, you were never really that type of person that it's good with numbers.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
No, I'm terrible with numbers.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I can't even remember my own phone number.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Really?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
That's true.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Like, I really, if someone asked me for my phone number,

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
I have to look on my phone in the address book to find it.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Well, yeah, sometimes numbers can be difficult.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
I kind of liked math when I was younger.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
It's, it just made sense.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Hmm.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Well, I guess there's a reason why I'm an English teacher about a math teacher.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
And I was actually not very good at language.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
But here you are.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Exactly.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Well, I mean in Spanish, I had like grammar.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Oh.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Not very good at that.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
All those rules.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah, but you're pretty good at English.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh, that's all right.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
That's all right.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
What about you guys?

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Tell us what your favorite subject or your least favorite subject in school was.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
What about you?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Do you have any favorite subject?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Or did you have a favorite subject?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
History.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
History.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Okay.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I liked chemistry for a while.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Oh, God.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Chemistry involves numbers.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Well, a little bit.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
But it was interesting as well.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
So come to the website, everyone.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Englishpod.com.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
And you can find lots of other resources there.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
And also be sure to check out our activity stream where you can answer and ask.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Very quick questions depending on your level.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So you can choose if you're an elementary student.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Then you would be talking to other elementary's.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
That's right.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Thanks for downloading this lesson and until next time.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Goodbye.
