00:06.000 --> 00:11.120
Erica today we're bringing you part two of another great lesson that we had yes new

00:11.120 --> 00:17.200
guy in town new guy in town part two part two kind of a creepy story yes and this one

00:17.200 --> 00:24.000
is also a little bit strange a little bit weird yeah unusual outcome unusual ending but

00:24.000 --> 00:29.360
it has to do a lot with invitations that's right so an invitation is when you ask

00:29.440 --> 00:34.160
somebody to do something with you right a dinner invitation so we're going to be talking

00:34.160 --> 00:39.920
about invitations and inviting people to do things okay well with that let's listen to the

00:39.920 --> 00:51.360
dialogue for the first time oh harmon thank you for such a thoughtful invitation it's really

00:51.360 --> 00:57.680
very nice of you to invite us over for dinner don't you think so Ellen oh yeah yes of course

00:57.680 --> 01:04.000
we'd love to come over can I bring anything no don't worry about it I'll take care of everything

01:06.400 --> 01:09.840
I'll see you tonight come with an appetite then what I will

01:15.440 --> 01:20.800
I don't want to go over to his place with dinner he gives me the creeps why and earth did you accept

01:20.800 --> 01:26.560
oh come on Ellen it'll be nice to get to know him besides he's new to the neighborhood

01:26.640 --> 01:32.720
and it'll be rude to decline his invitation I guess so you always wrote me into things like this

01:46.480 --> 01:55.920
ladies thank you for coming you look delicious I mean beautiful

01:56.000 --> 02:05.360
please come in oh Ellen you are too kind how did I get myself into this

02:18.880 --> 02:25.040
wow I'm really anxious to see what happens in this dinner party yeah I guess we'll have to stay tuned and

02:25.200 --> 02:32.080
find out for part three yeah all right well we have some really great vocabulary so I guess we can start with

02:32.080 --> 02:40.720
language takeaway language takeaway all right on language takeaway today we have three great words

02:40.720 --> 02:47.200
uh Erica why don't you start us off with the first one the first word is thoughtful thoughtful thoughtful

02:48.000 --> 02:54.480
thoughtful so when you're thoughtful you're kind right behind you consider it yes to other people

02:54.560 --> 02:59.520
you think about what the other person would like right and you do that thing it's so thoughtful of you

02:59.520 --> 03:06.880
yeah our second phrase give me the creeps give me the creeps give me the creeps

03:06.880 --> 03:12.000
this is kind of a funny phrase but I think if we listen to some examples we'll understand the meaning

03:13.200 --> 03:14.160
example one

03:14.560 --> 03:27.920
horror movies give me the creeps example two stop it you're giving me the creeps

03:31.040 --> 03:37.680
example three I saw this really scary clown it gave me the creeps

03:38.320 --> 03:45.760
so I can see this one means to make me feel uncomfortable right it makes me feel

03:46.560 --> 03:54.000
like scared yes yes it does me the creeps and our last phrase for language takeaway rope

03:54.000 --> 04:02.080
me into rope me into something rope me into something so if you rope me into something it's like you

04:02.160 --> 04:09.600
convince me to do something that I don't really want to do right so I rope to you into lending me your

04:09.600 --> 04:16.320
car yes it was a bad idea that was a bad idea and you wrote me into going out for beers after

04:16.320 --> 04:23.760
work yeah that was a great idea all right so rope me into events yeah all righty so I guess we could

04:23.760 --> 04:29.120
listen to our dialogue again this time a little bit slower and you'll be able to understand the language

04:29.120 --> 04:42.800
a little bit more clearly oh our mind thank you for such a thoughtful invitation

04:44.000 --> 04:51.760
it's really very nice of you to invite us over for dinner don't you think so Ellen oh yes of course

04:52.400 --> 04:58.560
we'd love to come over can I bring anything no don't worry about it

04:58.640 --> 05:05.600
I'll take care of everything I'll see you tonight come with an appetite I know I will

05:06.960 --> 05:13.760
I don't want to go over to his place for dinner he gives me the creeps why on earth did you accept

05:14.640 --> 05:21.840
oh come on Ellen it will be nice to get to know him besides he's new to the neighborhood

05:21.920 --> 05:29.360
and it will be rude to the client's invitation I guess so you always write me into things like this

05:31.520 --> 05:41.520
ladies thank you for coming you looked delicious I mean beautiful please come in come in

05:42.240 --> 05:48.160
oh our mind you are too kind how did I get myself into this

05:53.360 --> 05:58.400
well I guess that's a lot more clear and with that we can start putting it together today

06:00.560 --> 06:07.600
let's get together today we've got three words and phrases that we want to show you how you can

06:07.680 --> 06:17.360
put together and use differently the first one is appetite appetite appetite appetite so appetite is

06:17.360 --> 06:24.080
like a strong desire for food right right an appetite we've got some examples that show you how to

06:24.080 --> 06:32.960
use this phrase let's listen example one generous mill so good it's giving me an appetite

06:33.040 --> 06:43.040
example two you're sure eating a lot you must have a big appetite

06:46.480 --> 06:54.560
example three I'm getting sick have a fever and I lost my appetite

06:54.640 --> 07:03.600
okay so we saw some great examples of appetite you can lose your appetite that's right you have

07:03.600 --> 07:10.880
a big appetite small appetite a healthy appetite right so it just means a desire for food

07:10.880 --> 07:19.840
desire for food okay great what's our second phrase for today get to know someone get to know

07:20.720 --> 07:25.440
