00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
Hello everyone, welcome to another lesson at English Pod, my name is Marco.

00:07.520 --> 00:10.640
My name is Katherine, so Marco, what are we talking about today?

00:10.640 --> 00:16.880
Today we're going to be talking about a popular topic all over the world and that is smoking.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.200
Well, not so popular in the States right now, to be honest.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.000
Well, that's the thing, and every country in the world now they are becoming more strict on

00:24.000 --> 00:29.040
smoking and where you can smoke, so it's becoming very difficult for smokers nowadays.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.360
Well, it's a good reason to want to quit.

00:31.360 --> 00:35.200
And that's what we're going to be talking about today is quitting smoking.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.120
Well, before we get going, we do have a really important phrase that we should preview in

00:39.120 --> 00:43.120
today's vocabulary preview. Very vocabulary preview.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.600
All right, so on vocabulary preview, we're going to take a look at this word,

00:47.600 --> 00:55.760
pack of smokes. Pack of smokes. So a pack of smokes. So smokes is a word for cigarettes. It's the

00:55.840 --> 01:01.520
same thing, smokes or cigarettes. Right, but a pack is, you know, like 20 cigarettes.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.720
It's a box of cigarettes. You buy them in a pack. You don't just buy one at a time. So again,

01:06.720 --> 01:12.320
the phrase is pack of smokes. Pack of smokes. So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first

01:12.880 --> 01:15.600
time and see what's going on with this smoker?

01:24.960 --> 01:33.680
Oh, it smells like an ice train here. Hi, honey. What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face?

01:33.680 --> 01:39.040
What's wrong? I thought we agreed you were going to quit smoking. No, I said I was going to cut

01:39.040 --> 01:43.920
down, which is very different. You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

01:43.920 --> 01:49.520
Look, there are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

01:49.520 --> 01:54.080
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing

01:54.080 --> 01:59.760
smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before. I know, I know.

02:00.320 --> 02:05.760
I really am trying, but I don't have the will power to just quit. I can't fight with the urge

02:05.760 --> 02:10.240
to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch. Please understand.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.240
Fine. I want to divorce.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.560
Sorry, I just just smoked the pack. I said,

02:24.240 --> 02:29.520
you do smoke. Don't you? Well, we'll talk about that later. All right. So it is a little bit

02:29.520 --> 02:35.680
extreme though. I mean, he's divorcing her because she won't quit. Well, some people really are

02:35.680 --> 02:41.680
health conscious and are afraid of the negative side of smoking, which has a lot of health

02:41.680 --> 02:47.200
side effect. Yeah. Well, as he was complaining about all the negative effects and the negative

02:47.200 --> 02:53.600
aspects of smoking, he did mention both of them mentioned a lot of great words and phrases. So

02:53.600 --> 02:58.960
why don't we take a look at them now in language takeaway? Language takeaway.

02:59.920 --> 03:05.360
Well, this first word is a word that's very important for any smoker who goes to a bar or restaurant

03:05.360 --> 03:11.520
and needs to put the ash somewhere, right? So when you smoke, there's some ash. There's some messy

03:11.520 --> 03:18.320
dirty stuff. And you need an ash tray to collect it and ash tray. So an ash tray is something that's

03:18.320 --> 03:22.160
usually round or square and you put it on a table and it's just very helpful to keep the house

03:22.160 --> 03:26.320
clean or restaurant clean. So if you're in a restaurant, you say, hey, can I have an ash tray,

03:27.200 --> 03:33.360
so the residue or the the stuff that when you're smoking, it comes out the gray, I don't know,

03:33.360 --> 03:41.680
like dust, it's called ash. Right. And this is a tray. But the complaint here is, oh, it smells like

03:41.680 --> 03:47.840
an ash tray in here. That means it smells really, really bad in here. Yeah, it smells like cigarettes.

03:47.840 --> 03:53.840
Yeah. So that word again is ash tray. Ash tray. All right. Well, and the guy was complaining

03:53.920 --> 03:58.720
and he said, well, I thought you were going to quit smoking and she said, no, no, I said, I was going to

03:58.720 --> 04:05.520
cut down. She says, it's very different from quitting smoking. So Mark, oh, maybe we should talk about how

04:05.520 --> 04:11.200
cutting down and quitting are different. All right. So if I say, I'm going to cut down on smoking,

04:11.200 --> 04:18.080
it's just I'm going to smoke less. Okay. So let's take an example. I smoke 10 cigarettes today,

04:18.080 --> 04:23.040
but I want to cut down. How many should I smoke later? Maybe like two or three? Three, two,

04:23.920 --> 04:30.320
instead of quitting. So if you quit smoking, that would mean zero. Zero cigarettes. No smoking anymore.

04:30.320 --> 04:36.400
Right. All right. So you can also cut down on carbs like carbohydrates. So some people who cut

04:36.400 --> 04:43.120
down on carbs eat less bread. They don't eat any pasta. So these are really good ways of

04:43.120 --> 04:48.800
trying to talk about dieting as well as smoking. Right. And I think we have a couple of examples of

04:48.800 --> 04:54.880
other ways we can use this phrase cut down. So let's listen to them now. Example one.

04:56.800 --> 05:02.400
Our company has decided to cut down our workload. So from now on, we leave it 3pm every Friday.

05:03.920 --> 05:10.400
Example two. You should really cut down on the amount of salt you eat. It's not good for you.

05:12.400 --> 05:18.560
Example three. My doctor told me I need to cut down on fatty foods because of my

05:19.280 --> 05:26.000
heart condition. And when you want to smoke a cigarette, you have to do something first

05:26.000 --> 05:32.720
with some fires. We call this lighting up to light up. So lighting up, it doesn't mean turning on the

05:32.720 --> 05:38.560
light. It actually means using a lighter or some fire to start your cigarette. Right. So you want to

05:38.560 --> 05:43.280
light up with the lighter matches or some sort of fire. The the man says the husband says,

05:43.280 --> 05:48.560
it's not like you can just light up like before that means it's not like you can just smoke

05:48.560 --> 05:53.840
like before. So in some cases light up means to smoke a cigarette. We're in a movie theater and someone

05:53.840 --> 05:58.560
lights a cigarette. And I say, oh, you can't light up in here. Right. So you can't smoke in here.

05:58.560 --> 06:03.200
You can't smoke. It's another way of saying smoking. Mm-hmm. Very good. And she was explaining

06:03.200 --> 06:08.720
you know how difficult it is and she's trying to quit. But she said, I don't have the wheel

06:08.720 --> 06:14.160
power to just quit. Ooh, wheel power. So this is an important word. Wheel power. Wheel power. You

06:14.160 --> 06:19.760
think of the main part of this word as will. That means the desire to do something. You want to do

06:19.760 --> 06:24.800
something. So if I have wheel power, I have strong wheel power. What am I saying? You're saying that

06:24.800 --> 06:31.760
you can make a decision and you can follow your decision. So I decide not to eat cake. I have

06:31.840 --> 06:37.040
very strong wheel power. So I never eat cake. Mm-hmm. If I don't have strong wheel power,

06:37.040 --> 06:42.480
maybe I sometimes take secretly eat cake in the middle of the night from my refrigerator.

06:42.480 --> 06:48.000
So that happens, right? Sometimes you don't have strong enough wheel power so you kind of eat a little

06:48.000 --> 06:52.160
bit of cake. Yeah. Nobody's watching. Exactly. And you can have wheel power about lots of different

06:52.160 --> 06:58.800
things. So this is a great word again to use when you're talking about dieting or smoking or drinking.

06:58.800 --> 07:05.280
Any type of maybe temptation. Mm-hmm. Exactly. All right. And well, she said she had this urge

07:05.280 --> 07:10.720
to reach for her pack of smokes. Ooh, urge is another good one. It's very similar to wheel power,

07:10.720 --> 07:15.920
but an urge is kind of like a physical feeling that makes you want to do something.

07:15.920 --> 07:21.600
So you have like the strong desire. Mm-hmm. So I have the urge to go swimming today. I don't know

07:21.600 --> 07:25.840
why, but I really want to. All right. You have an urge. Interesting word.

07:25.920 --> 07:29.520
Pregnant women often have these kinds of things too. I have the urge to do something.

07:29.520 --> 07:34.720
We also call them cravings. Oh, cravings are urge to do something. All right. Interesting.

07:34.720 --> 07:39.920
So you're taking a look at these five great words. And I think we should listen to a dialogue again.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.760
We're going to slow it down just a little bit and then we'll come back and talk some more.

07:50.160 --> 07:54.560
Oh, it smells like an ash tray in here. Hi, honey.

07:55.440 --> 08:02.000
What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face? What's wrong? I thought we agreed

08:02.000 --> 08:08.960
that you were going to quit smoking. No. I said I was going to cut down, which is very different.

08:09.600 --> 08:16.240
You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight. Look, there are other ways to quit.

08:16.800 --> 08:24.240
You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.320
And now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place.

08:29.040 --> 08:35.680
It's not like you can just light up like before. I know. I know. I really am trying, but

08:36.320 --> 08:41.520
I don't have the will power to just quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my

08:41.520 --> 08:48.960
pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch. Please understand. Fine. I want a divorce.

08:49.920 --> 08:56.560
And we are back. So we have a great part of our show. We like to talk about some phrases

08:56.560 --> 09:01.520
that help you attain fluency. That means sounding like a native speaker of English and today's

09:01.520 --> 09:06.400
phrases are wonderful. All right. So let's take a look at them now in fluency builder.

09:07.840 --> 09:14.480
Fluency builder. So on fluency builder today, let's take a look at two different phrases and let's

09:14.560 --> 09:19.360
start with the first one. She mentioned something about going cold turkey overnight.

09:19.360 --> 09:25.280
What is that phrase, gold, cold turkey? Now this is a very strange phrase. Okay. So first of all,

09:25.280 --> 09:29.040
why would a turkey be cold? They have lots of feathers. And second of all, why would it? What

09:29.040 --> 09:34.960
is it have to do with cigarettes? Right. So if I say I'm going cold turkey, what is that? So just take

09:34.960 --> 09:40.320
this as a phrase. Don't think about the actual words because they won't make sense in this context.

09:40.480 --> 09:47.840
What we're talking about is quitting smoking entirely. You're not going to cut down. That means today,

09:47.840 --> 09:52.880
I'm not going to smoke at all. And I'm never going to smoke again. That means never, ever will I

09:52.880 --> 09:58.880
smoke another cigarette. So it's cold turkey. So if I go cold turkey means I stop doing something

09:58.880 --> 10:04.880
immediately and suddenly and forever. It's entirely. All right. So you can use this phrase for different

10:04.880 --> 10:10.160
habits, different things that you do like drinking, for example, or cutting down on sugar.

10:10.640 --> 10:14.880
But generally, we just say this about cigarettes. So it's mostly related to smoking. Yeah.

10:14.880 --> 10:20.800
So going cold turkey. Some people like to smoke less like one cigarette a day or one cigarette a week.

10:20.800 --> 10:26.800
But going cold turkey is supposed to be the hardest. Right. Okay. Going cold turkey. All right. And

10:26.800 --> 10:31.200
well, he was explaining the different negative aspects of smoking. He said, well, you know,

10:31.200 --> 10:38.000
they spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and he said, laws are cracking down. So if the laws are

10:38.080 --> 10:42.880
cracking down, what is he trying to say there? Well, this is actually a very interesting point

10:42.880 --> 10:49.520
because in America right now, it's very hard to smoke in public places. So this means that the government

10:49.520 --> 10:56.080
is trying to stop people from smoking. So they say no more smoking in public places, no more smoking

10:56.080 --> 11:01.200
in restaurants, no more smoking in bars. And so this means they're cracking down. They're making

11:01.200 --> 11:06.720
it harder to do something. So they are becoming more strict. I think for this phrase, we should

11:06.800 --> 11:12.320
listen to a couple of more examples just to make sure we understand it. Example one.

11:14.560 --> 11:19.840
The police are cracking down on drunk driving in our city. Example two.

11:21.760 --> 11:26.800
Our school has really started to crack down on tardiness. Example three.

11:29.040 --> 11:33.280
The prison has passed a law that will crack down possession of legal substances.

11:33.440 --> 11:39.040
All right. So the government is cracking down laws or cracking down.

11:39.840 --> 11:44.320
Yeah, exactly. So this is an important one because you read this in the newspapers as well about certain

11:44.320 --> 11:49.840
laws and police action. All right. Great. So I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for

11:49.840 --> 11:54.320
one last time. And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this advice.

12:03.360 --> 12:12.080
Oh, it smells like an ash train here. Hi, honey. What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face?

12:12.080 --> 12:17.040
What's wrong? I thought we agreed you were going to quit smoking. No, I said I was going to

12:17.040 --> 12:22.240
cut down, which is very different. You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

12:22.240 --> 12:27.920
Look, there are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

12:27.920 --> 12:32.480
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month. And now laws are cracking down and not allowing

12:32.480 --> 12:37.120
smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before.

12:37.120 --> 12:43.440
I know. I know. I really am trying, but I don't have the willpower to just quit. I can't fight

12:43.440 --> 12:48.000
with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch. Please

12:48.000 --> 12:50.480
understand. Fine. I want to divorce.

12:56.720 --> 13:01.680
So do you have a problem with this advice as you call it? Are you a smoker?

13:01.680 --> 13:08.640
I'm really not. I'm the type of person that could maybe smoke socially. Like if we go out to a bar

13:08.640 --> 13:14.240
with drinks, a social smoker, like they call it, right? Yeah. I'm jealous. But not really. You're a

13:14.240 --> 13:19.600
habitual smoker, right? Right. Well, I was. I'm trying to cut down. So as a habitual smoker,

13:19.600 --> 13:25.360
often smoked every day, sometimes I smoked a lot, and sometimes I smoke less. But right now,

13:25.360 --> 13:31.600
I'm in a period where I'm mostly quit. Okay, almost. Yeah. Well, I haven't smoked in a

13:31.600 --> 13:36.080
while. I'm going to do it's just one cigarette. Now, it is interesting because like we mentioned

13:36.080 --> 13:40.800
laws or cracking down or where you can smoke, but also taxes and cigarettes are becoming much

13:40.800 --> 13:45.680
more expensive, right? Absolutely. Especially where I'm from in Chicago. It's easy to spend maybe

13:45.680 --> 13:51.200
10 US dollars or 12 US dollars on one pack of cigarettes. On a pack of cigarettes, imagine that.

13:51.200 --> 13:57.440
So, and you have people that can't help smoking one or two packs a day. So how much is that a month?

13:57.440 --> 14:02.320
It's just an amazing amount of money. Wow, as well. And I have to say, though, a lot of my friends

14:02.320 --> 14:07.920
who used to smoke in America have quit. So this is maybe working. The whole thing of making

14:07.920 --> 14:11.920
cigarettes more expensive. Yeah, making them much more expensive. Now, another interesting thing

14:11.920 --> 14:16.400
and what I was reading recently is that, you know, those warnings that come on cigarette

14:16.400 --> 14:21.600
packs. It says, you know, smoking chaos, smoking causes cancer. Actually, a study has proven

14:21.600 --> 14:25.760
that it's not effective that people don't mind it or even worry about the

14:25.760 --> 14:30.080
costions on the cigarette packages. Well, as a smoker, I could say that, yeah, you generally,

14:30.080 --> 14:33.680
if you're going to smoke a cigarette, don't look at the label that much. You just, you know,

14:33.680 --> 14:37.680
you throw it in your bag and you forget about it. But it's actually gotten to the point where people

14:37.680 --> 14:41.360
choose the cigarette pack based on the picture. So they're like, oh, yeah, give me the one with the

14:41.360 --> 14:46.960
black lungs or give me that one. Oh, God. Yeah, it's interesting. So it's not really working,

14:46.960 --> 14:51.360
I guess, we're going to have to find other ways to make people more conscious about this advice.

14:51.440 --> 14:56.800
We should. But come to our website at english.com. Tell us what you think about this

14:56.800 --> 15:01.440
by smoking. Is it good? Is it bad? Are you a habitual smoker or just a social smoker?

Yeah, we also have lots of great stuff tools for you on our website and expansion sentences and
