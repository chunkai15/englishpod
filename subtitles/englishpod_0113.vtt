00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

00:05.920 --> 00:06.920
My name is Marco.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.360
And I'm Erica.

00:08.360 --> 00:13.320
And today we are going to have a lesson that is going to be very useful when you arrive

00:13.320 --> 00:14.320
late.

00:14.320 --> 00:20.760
Yes, well we all have arrived late to something and we need a good way of saying sorry and

00:20.760 --> 00:22.640
saying why we were late.

00:22.640 --> 00:27.240
So today we're not only going to be looking at vocabulary used to explain why you

00:27.280 --> 00:31.160
are late, but also some typical excuses of why people are late.

00:31.160 --> 00:35.000
Right, so some normal reasons for saying why you're late.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.960
Well, why don't we get started with the dialogue.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.680
Now we're going to hear five people in the dialogue.

00:40.680 --> 00:45.640
So at the beginning we'll hear the boss and the assistant and then we'll hear three

00:45.640 --> 00:47.640
people who are arriving late.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.240
Where's everyone?

00:59.240 --> 01:02.240
We're supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.240
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.240
She said she got tied up with a client.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.240
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

01:08.240 --> 01:11.240
Oh, there was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.240
Morning, everyone.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.240
Are you stuck in traffic as well, Jess?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.240
There was a huge pile up on the highway.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.240
And traffic was backed up for miles.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.240
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.240
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

01:25.240 --> 01:28.240
Guys, this is not acceptable.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.240
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.240
Not 10-01 and definitely not 10-20.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.240
All right, let's get started.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.240
So the first thing I want to talk about is...

01:38.240 --> 01:39.240
I'm sorry, everyone.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.240
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.240
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way way too long.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.240
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.

01:48.240 --> 01:53.240
Alright, so, well, good excuses.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.240
In general, except the last one.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.240
I don't think that's such a good excuse of why you're late, right?

01:58.240 --> 02:01.240
Yeah, I don't really think if I was the boss,

02:01.240 --> 02:03.240
I would be very happy with this employee.

02:03.240 --> 02:06.240
Yeah, I don't think coffee is that important.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.240
But some of the excuses were good.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.240
And some of the language they used to describe the excuses was really great.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.240
So let's look at that now in language takeaway.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.240
Language takeaway.

02:17.240 --> 02:22.240
Alright, on language takeaway, today we have four words that we're going to be looking at

02:22.240 --> 02:25.240
and let's get started with the first one.

02:25.240 --> 02:30.240
So Joe called the office assistant and explained that she will be late

02:30.240 --> 02:34.240
because she got tied up with a client.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.240
To get tied up.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.240
So I got tied up with a client.

02:39.240 --> 02:43.240
Alright, this is a really common reason for being late,

02:43.240 --> 02:48.240
but why don't we listen to some examples to help us understand what it means?

02:48.240 --> 02:51.240
Example one.

02:51.240 --> 02:56.240
Sorry, I'm late, honey. I got tied up at the office.

02:56.240 --> 03:00.240
Example two.

03:00.240 --> 03:06.240
I was tied up on the phone all afternoon and didn't get any work done.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.240
Example three.

03:10.240 --> 03:15.240
I got tied up and traffic on the way here.

03:15.240 --> 03:20.240
Alright, so if you get tied up, it means that you get busy with something that you can't avoid.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.240
Right, you're busy with something that's so important.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.240
It's like you are tied by a rope to that thing.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.240
Okay, I got tied up.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.240
I'm sorry, I got tied up.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.240
Yep.

03:31.240 --> 03:38.240
Alright, now the first person that arrived to the office will explain that there was a huge traffic jam on the highway.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.240
A traffic jam.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.240
A traffic jam.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.240
A huge traffic jam.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.240
Now we understand traffic, right?

03:46.240 --> 03:47.240
Cars a lot of cars.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.240
Yep.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.240
So a jam means that it was like blocked.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.240
It was stopped.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.240
It was stopped.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.240
Yep.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.240
There were a lot of cars on the highway and they weren't moving.

03:55.240 --> 04:01.240
So a huge traffic jam is a very, very big stopping of cars.

04:01.240 --> 04:06.240
Now our next word explains why sometimes there is a traffic jam.

04:08.240 --> 04:28.240
Well, we found out that there was a huge pile-up.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.240
A pile-up.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.240
A huge pile-up.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.240
Okay, a huge pile-up.

04:32.240 --> 04:36.240
Now if a pile-up is another way of saying an accident, right?

04:36.240 --> 04:41.240
Yeah, an accident with many cars and they all get piled on top of each other.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.240
Alright, so many cars got into an accident.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.240
Yep.

04:45.240 --> 04:48.240
So this could be a reason of why there was a traffic jam.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.240
And also a reason for why you were late?

04:50.240 --> 04:51.240
Alright.

04:51.240 --> 04:56.240
Now the other person Scott also called and he said that he's running late.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.240
He's running late.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.240
He's running late.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.240
I'm running late.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.240
Now if I'm running late,

05:02.240 --> 05:03.240
am I actually running somewhere?

05:03.240 --> 05:04.240
What am I doing?

05:04.240 --> 05:05.240
What's happening?

05:05.240 --> 05:08.240
You are going to be late and you know you're going to be late.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.240
Okay, I know I'm going to be late.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.240
So I'll call you and I'll say, hey, I'm running a little bit late.

05:14.240 --> 05:19.240
Yeah, actually this is the most common thing I say when I'm going to be late.

05:19.240 --> 05:23.240
And I think it's really important to know how to use this phrase.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.240
So let's hear some more examples.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.240
Example one.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.240
Jane is running late.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.240
She'll be here in 10 minutes.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.240
Example two.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.240
Traffic is really bad.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.240
Some running late.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.240
Example three.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.240
I'm running a bit late.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.240
So please start without me.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.240
Alright, perfect.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.240
So running late.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.240
A very common way of explaining that you're going to be late.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.240
And well, it makes you sound very native.

05:56.240 --> 05:57.240
Yeah, it's a great phrase.

05:57.240 --> 06:05.240
Now our last phrase what we heard the reason why Scott was running late was because his last meeting ran over.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.240
Okay, to run over my meeting ran over.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.240
Now ran over my meeting ran over.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.240
It means it went too far.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.240
Well, when something runs over, it goes longer.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.240
Okay, longer than expected.

06:17.240 --> 06:22.240
Yeah, so a meeting can run over or an employment can run over.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.240
So I can say my meeting ran over 15 minutes.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.240
I'm going to be a little bit late.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.240
That's right.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.240
A great excuse.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.240
Very good.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.240
Five great words.

06:30.240 --> 06:37.240
And well, I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue and understand these words as they were used in the dialogue.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.240
And then we'll come back and take a look at more phrases.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
Where is everyone?

06:45.240 --> 06:48.240
We were supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.240
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.240
She said she got tied up with a client.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.240
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.240
There was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
Morning, everyone.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.240
Were you stuck in traffic as well, Jess?

07:02.240 --> 07:05.240
There was a huge pile up on the highway.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.240
And traffic was backed up for miles.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.240
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.240
His last meeting ran over.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.240
But he's on his way now.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.240
Guys, this is not acceptable.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.240
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.240
Not 10-01 and definitely not 10-20.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.240
All right, let's get started.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.240
So the first thing I want to talk about is our...

07:26.240 --> 07:28.240
I'm really sorry, everyone.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.240
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

07:31.240 --> 07:35.240
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way too long.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.240
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.

07:41.240 --> 07:46.240
Okay, we got some more great phrases for describing being late.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.240
Let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

07:50.240 --> 07:55.240
When Joe called, she said she'd be there in a sec.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.240
I'll be here in a sec.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.240
I'll be here in a sec.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.240
So when someone will be here in a sec, it means they'll be here very soon.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.240
Okay, I'll be here in a sec.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.240
I'll be there in a sec.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.240
But what about this word, sec?

08:07.240 --> 08:09.240
It's a short way of saying second.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.240
So SEC.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.240
A sec.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.240
Now it's an exaggeration obviously because you won't be there in one second.

08:15.240 --> 08:19.240
But you're just explaining that you'll be there very, very soon.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.240
What about the difference between I'll be here in a sec and I'll be here in a minute?

08:23.240 --> 08:27.240
Well, if you say I'll be there in a sec, it means I'll be there in one minute, right?

08:27.240 --> 08:33.240
But if you say I'll be there in a minute, it could be a minute or more like three or four or five minutes.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.240
Yeah, I think that's true.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.240
Now again, going back to this traffic issue,

08:37.240 --> 08:41.240
we saw that somebody was stuck in traffic.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.240
To be stuck in traffic.

08:43.240 --> 08:45.240
I got stuck in traffic.

08:45.240 --> 08:51.240
Now when you're stuck in traffic, you can't drive because there are too many cars stopped on the highway.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.240
So you are actually in the traffic.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.240
Yeah, you're stopped there for like 20 minutes.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.240
You can't move.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.240
Okay, I'm stuck in traffic.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.240
I'm going to be late.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.240
Mm-hmm.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.240
Really great excuse.

09:01.240 --> 09:08.240
And the reason they were stuck in traffic was because traffic was backed up for miles.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.240
Okay, traffic is backed up for miles.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.240
To be backed up for miles.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.240
Now if I say the traffic is backed up for miles,

09:16.240 --> 09:19.240
it means that it's very long or how does that work.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.240
Well, okay, imagine there is an accident.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.240
Mm-hmm.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.240
And that has caused the traffic jam.

09:24.240 --> 09:28.240
And the cars are lined up for many miles behind you.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.240
Okay, so it's backed up from that point.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.240
There are many miles of cars waiting to pass.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.240
Yep.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
So it's backed up for miles.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.240
Very good.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
So great phrases.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.240
And I think it's appropriate for us to listen to the dialogue for the very last time.

09:42.240 --> 09:47.240
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this being on time issue.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.240
Where's everyone?

09:59.240 --> 10:01.240
We're supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

10:01.240 --> 10:04.240
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.240
She said she got tied up with a client.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.240
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.240
Oh, there was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.240
Morning, everyone.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.240
Are you stuck in traffic as well, Jess?

10:14.240 --> 10:16.240
There was a huge pile up on the highway.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.240
And traffic was backed up for miles.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.240
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.240
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.240
Guys, this is not acceptable.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.240
If I say the means starts at 10,

10:29.240 --> 10:31.240
the meaning starts at 10.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.240
Not 1001 and definitely not 1020.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.240
All right, let's get started.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.240
So the first thing I want to talk about is,

10:38.240 --> 10:39.240
Sorry, everyone.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.240
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.240
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way, way too long.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.240
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.

10:52.240 --> 10:58.240
Oh, Marco, I know that ideas about time and ideas about being late are different in different countries.

10:58.240 --> 11:03.240
Yeah, in different countries, people treat time or being on time in different ways.

11:03.240 --> 11:07.240
Yeah, like I'm from Canada and I look at being on time really different than you do, right?

11:07.240 --> 11:11.240
Yes, because for example, if you call for a meeting at nine o'clock,

11:11.240 --> 11:16.240
usually people will be there at nine o'clock because a meeting will start in America.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.240
Right, in America.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.240
Now for example, Latin America, we do have this,

11:20.240 --> 11:23.240
what we call sometimes the Latino time or Hispanic time,

11:23.240 --> 11:27.240
which is like nine o'clock is like the time that everyone should be there,

11:27.240 --> 11:30.240
but until people get there, get their coffee,

11:30.240 --> 11:33.240
whatever, then it'll be nine, 15, maybe up to nine, 30.

11:33.240 --> 11:40.240
And I think it's a little bit even more noticeable when we're talking about social events.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.240
Like if you go to someone's house for dinner in Canada,

11:43.240 --> 11:46.240
if they say come to my house at six o'clock for dinner,

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
you'll be there at 605, right?

11:48.240 --> 11:54.240
Okay, yeah, usually you'll be there only a couple of minutes after the time that was specified,

11:54.240 --> 11:57.240
just to give the house owner a little bit of time.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.240
But if we have a dinner invitation for six,

11:59.240 --> 12:02.240
we know that it's not really going to begin eating at six,

12:02.240 --> 12:05.240
so people will get there at six, 30 or seven.

12:05.240 --> 12:09.240
And of course, food isn't ready until maybe eight or nine.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.240
But in German countries from what I know,

12:12.240 --> 12:15.240
you've got to be, if they say be there at six,

12:15.240 --> 12:17.240
you're there at six, 00, right?

12:17.240 --> 12:19.240
Not six or one.

12:19.240 --> 12:23.240
And also I think it's about when people start work, right?

12:23.240 --> 12:24.240
Yeah.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.240
At the time you have to begin work.

12:26.240 --> 12:30.240
Sometimes it's acceptable to be 10 or 15 minutes so-called late,

12:30.240 --> 12:32.240
but in other places, you know?

12:32.240 --> 12:34.240
Yeah, North America, if you're supposed to start work at nine,

12:34.240 --> 12:36.240
you have to be at your desk working at nine.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.240
At nine.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.240
Yeah.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.240
Yeah, see that in in other countries,

12:40.240 --> 12:42.240
people get there at nine, get their coffee,

12:42.240 --> 12:44.240
maybe take a quick glance at their emails,

12:44.240 --> 12:46.240
the newspaper, and then you know,

12:46.240 --> 12:48.240
start working at around nine, 30 or 10.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.240
So I guess the important thing is to know

12:50.240 --> 12:52.240
what the tradition is in the country way,

12:52.240 --> 12:53.240
you know?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.240
Exactly.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.240
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com

12:56.240 --> 12:58.240
and let us know how it works in your countries.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.240
I know that many different countries

13:00.240 --> 13:02.240
have a different way of treating time.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.240
So share it with us.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.240
Yes.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.240
And remember, if you have any questions,

13:05.240 --> 13:07.240
please ask them at the website as well.

13:07.240 --> 13:09.240
We're out of time today.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.240
But until next time,

13:10.240 --> 13:12.240
thanks for listening and goodbye.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.240
Bye-bye.
