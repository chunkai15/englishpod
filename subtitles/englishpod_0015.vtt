Hello everyone and welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod. My name is Marko and I'm

00:07.200 --> 00:13.200
Erica. Erica, today we have a great intermediate lesson. That's right, we've got a lesson

00:13.200 --> 00:20.800
about love, about love, and about apologizing. Okay, love and apologizing. They go together.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.840
Yes, they do, especially if you have a girlfriend or boyfriend, right? That's true. Okay, so

00:25.840 --> 00:31.440
I don't mean we start by looking at our vocabulary preview. Very vocabulary preview.

00:32.400 --> 00:40.480
In today's vocabulary preview, we will learn two important words from our dialogue. What's the

00:40.480 --> 00:49.360
first word? Knock over. Knock over. Knock over. Knock over. So that's a really simple one.

00:49.360 --> 00:55.200
When you knock something over, you make it fall down. Make it fall down. Yep. Speaking of

00:55.200 --> 01:03.600
knocking things over this morning, I knocked over my coffee cup all over my desk. Yeah, I saw that. You almost

01:03.600 --> 01:11.040
ruined our lesson plan for today. Yes. I did. It was all over the place. Okay, let's look at our

01:11.120 --> 01:20.080
second word. Explode. Explode. Explode. Explode. So when something explodes, this is what happens.

01:28.080 --> 01:33.520
All right, that's pretty clear. That's more than clear, I think. So now we've looked at our

01:33.520 --> 01:38.880
two vocabulary preview words for this dialogue, and we are ready to listen to it for the first time.

01:41.440 --> 02:00.080
Wow, what's going on? Watch out! Hey, what are you going? Oh no, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

02:01.360 --> 02:06.720
I don't know. I feel terrible. I really didn't mean to knock you over. My marriage exploded,

02:06.720 --> 02:11.200
and I lost control of my bike. Really, it was an accident. Please accept my apologies.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.880
Just let me try to stand up.

02:14.880 --> 02:38.400
Oh, wait a second, you seem really familiar. I think I know you're from somewhere.

02:39.200 --> 02:43.840
Yeah, that's right. I think we have met somewhere before. We met an errands place last weekend.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.800
What a coincidence. But anyway, I'm glad to see you're not badly hurt, and I should probably

02:48.800 --> 02:54.240
get going. I've got an IVC meeting. But here's my number. Call me and we'll exchange insurance

02:54.240 --> 02:59.680
information. Oh, my ankle. I think it's broken. You can't just leave me like this.

03:06.080 --> 03:11.200
Are you calling an ambulance? Nope. I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

03:14.800 --> 03:30.160
When we met, that's day. I know you were my friend. I'm chill. I love you.

03:30.560 --> 03:45.520
I love happy ending. Such a romantic dialogue. Yeah, this guy. Oh my god, he is amazing. I would love

03:45.520 --> 03:53.120
to meet a guy like that. Like that, like crashing into you. Maybe not like that. Okay, well, I think

03:53.120 --> 03:59.440
it's time to look at some of the language in this dialogue. Let's start with our language takeaway.

04:01.120 --> 04:09.760
Language takeaway. Today we have three important words from our dialogue that we will learn

04:09.760 --> 04:18.640
for our language takeaway. The first word is familiar familiar familiar familiar. This one I

04:18.640 --> 04:24.720
think is a little bit hard to explain. Yeah, so let's listen to some examples on how we use familiar.

04:24.800 --> 04:34.400
Example one. Norman Clark. That name sounds familiar. Where have I heard it before?

04:37.440 --> 04:47.280
Example two. Do you know where we are? I have no idea. Nothing looks familiar. I think we're lost.

04:48.160 --> 04:57.200
Example three. You look really familiar. Did we go to high school together?

05:00.960 --> 05:08.320
So when something's familiar, you think you know it, but you're not exactly sure. Exactly,

05:08.400 --> 05:19.200
familiar. Okay. Our next word is place, place, place, air in place. Exactly. So when we refer to

05:19.200 --> 05:26.080
place, we refer to house. Right, so I can say, hey, Marco, come over to my place for dinner tonight.

05:26.080 --> 05:32.800
Exactly, or I could say, we're having a party at my place tonight at eight. You might ask someone,

05:32.800 --> 05:38.160
how's your new place? Right. How's your new apartment? Exactly. That's a good one. So place,

05:38.160 --> 05:47.840
it's a house. Right. Our final word today is coincidence. Coincidence. Coincidence. Coincidence.

05:48.560 --> 05:55.600
So again, we have some great examples for you to understand how we use coincidence. Example one.

05:55.840 --> 06:05.760
I'm going to New York this weekend. What a coincidence. I am too. Example two.

06:08.640 --> 06:16.960
By coincidence, everyone in the room was named Alex. Example three.

06:17.840 --> 06:26.000
We met by pure coincidence. When they ran into each other on our bikes and we've been together ever since.

06:29.120 --> 06:34.320
A coincidence is something that happens by chance, right? Right. You didn't plan it. It just happened.

06:34.320 --> 06:39.280
Yeah, these funny little things happen all the time. I love it when these coincidence is happened.

06:40.320 --> 06:45.280
Yeah, they're great. So Erica, why don't you tell us about a coincidence that's happened to you?

06:45.920 --> 06:54.640
Well, the other night I was having dinner in a restaurant and I looked up and I saw my old professor

06:54.640 --> 07:00.800
from university. It was such a coincidence because here we are in Shanghai and I see my professor

07:00.800 --> 07:06.400
from Canada having dinner at the table next to me. It was such a coincidence. That is a coincidence.

07:06.400 --> 07:11.280
Yeah. Or has it ever happened to you that you're thinking of someone and that person calls you?

07:11.280 --> 07:18.240
That happens all the time. That's a coincidence. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so now that we have learned

07:18.240 --> 07:24.560
these three language takeaway words, we can listen to our dialogue a second time, but this time it's

07:24.560 --> 07:35.840
going to be slower. Hey, watch where you're going. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

07:36.400 --> 07:42.800
Oh, I don't know. I feel terrible. I didn't mean to knock you over.

07:43.440 --> 07:49.120
My tire just exploded and I lost control of my bike. Really, it was an accident.

07:49.760 --> 07:56.160
Please accept my apologies. Just let me try to stand up. Oh, wait a second,

07:56.880 --> 08:04.880
you seem really familiar. I think I know you from somewhere. Yeah, I think we have met

08:04.880 --> 08:11.760
somewhere before. That's right. We met at Erin's place last weekend. What a coincidence.

08:12.640 --> 08:17.600
But anyway, I'm glad to see that you're not badly hurt and I should probably get going.

08:18.240 --> 08:24.880
I have a nine o'clock meeting, but here's my number. Call me and it's change insurance information.

08:25.840 --> 08:32.960
Ouch. My ankle. I think it's broken. You can't just leave me like this.

08:33.280 --> 08:41.520
Are you calling an ambulance? No, I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

08:47.760 --> 08:53.280
Well, that was much clearer, wasn't it? Yes, that was clearer and this brings us to fluency

08:53.280 --> 09:00.480
builder fluency builder. In today's fluency builder, we're going to show you different ways of

09:00.480 --> 09:08.800
apologizing. It's so important to be able to apologize well and fluently. Exactly. And you also

09:08.800 --> 09:14.000
want to say something different from I'm sorry. Right. So that's what we're going to show you today.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.680
We heard some great expressions for I'm sorry in the dialogue. Let's listen now.

09:21.120 --> 09:27.520
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. Please accept my apologies.

09:31.280 --> 09:37.600
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. Please accept my apologies.

09:39.040 --> 09:44.240
Yeah, I feel terrible. I say this one all the time. Yeah, it's a great way of saying I'm sorry.

09:44.240 --> 09:48.800
Now also, if you want to say I'm sorry, you also want to tell the person that you made

09:48.800 --> 09:55.440
a mistake, right? That's true. And we did hear some wonderful expressions for I made a mistake in this

09:56.080 --> 10:01.760
dialogue. I didn't mean to knock you over. It was an accident.

10:04.880 --> 10:12.720
I didn't mean to knock you over. It was an accident. Well, I didn't mean to knock my coffee

10:12.720 --> 10:19.920
cup over this morning. Exactly. It was an accident. It was not on purpose, right? Or so you think.

10:20.400 --> 10:28.000
Okay. So all of these phrases are really useful and great for apologizing and telling someone you

10:28.000 --> 10:34.320
made a mistake. Well, it's time for us to listen to our dialogue at third time. This time it'll be

10:34.320 --> 10:38.240
at its normal speed. And I think you'll be able to understand a little bit better.

10:38.240 --> 10:58.080
Wow, what's going on? Watch out! Hey, what are you going? Oh no, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

10:59.360 --> 11:04.960
I don't know. I feel terrible. I really didn't mean to knock you over. My marriage exploded and I

11:04.960 --> 11:09.200
lost control of my bike. Really, it was an accident. Please accept my apologies.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.880
Just let me try to stand up.

11:12.880 --> 11:36.400
Oh, wait a second. You seem really familiar. I think I know you're from somewhere.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.840
Yeah, that's right. I think we've met somewhere before. We met at Erin's place last weekend.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.800
What a coincidence. But anyway, I'm glad to see you're not badly hurt and I should probably

11:46.800 --> 11:52.240
get going. I've got an IVC meeting. But here's my number. Call me and we'll exchange insurance

11:52.240 --> 11:57.760
information. Oh, my ankle. I think it's broken. You can't just leave me like this.

12:04.160 --> 12:09.280
Are you calling an ambulance? Nope. I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

12:12.800 --> 12:25.280
And leave me alone. Let's stay. I know you're my friend. I don't know you're my friend.

12:33.600 --> 12:40.720
Great dialogue and great music, right? Wonderful. I could pick that Marco. Of course me. I'm a romantic

12:40.800 --> 12:48.400
type. I love romantic music. Really? Yes. Well, speaking of a romantic type. Do you believe in love

12:48.400 --> 12:55.280
at first sight? I kind of do. I'd like to believe it. Yeah, well, that may surprise me.

12:56.880 --> 13:01.440
Well, I think the first time that you see someone, it impresses you some way and you feel attracted

13:01.440 --> 13:07.360
to that person. Really? Yeah. At least it's the first feeling that you get that makes you want to

13:07.360 --> 13:13.040
talk to that person or get to know that person. I'm the exact opposite. Really? When I see

13:13.040 --> 13:19.920
somebody for the first time, my first impression is always wrong. Okay. So if I see someone and I like

13:19.920 --> 13:26.000
them at the beginning in three weeks, I'll hate them. And if I see someone and I don't like them when

13:26.000 --> 13:31.760
I first meet them, I'll be their best friend. Yeah. So love it for sight doesn't work for me. I'm sure

13:31.760 --> 13:35.680
that our listeners have some stories that love it for sight. Maybe they've met their wives or their

13:35.760 --> 13:41.920
boyfriends in this way. I'd like to hear about it. Me too. And if anybody knows the name of the

13:41.920 --> 13:47.520
songs we used, also be sure to post it on the discussion board. That's right. Our challenge for this

13:47.520 --> 13:53.520
challenge for this lesson. Yeah. So that's all for today, everyone. But be sure to go to our

13:53.520 --> 13:59.840
website at english.com. And as we said, leave all your comments, your stories, and see if you know the

13:59.840 --> 14:05.920
name of the songs. Okay. Well, thanks for listening everyone. And until next time, goodbye.
